1,1,"Axons branch out toward their ends, and at the tip of each branch is a terminal button.",terminal button,71,85
1,1,"Within the neuron, when a signal is received by the dendrites, it is transmitted to the soma in the form of an electrical signal, and if the signal is strong enough, it may then be passed to the axon and then to the terminal buttons.",terminal button,216,230
1,1,"If the signal reaches the terminal buttons, they are signaled to emit chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which communicate with other neurons across the spaces between the cells, known as synapses.",terminal button,26,40
1,1,"If the signal reaches the terminal buttons, they are signaled to emit chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which communicate with other neurons across the spaces between the cells, known as synapses.",neurotransmitters,89,105
1,1,"As you can see in the following figure, neurons consist of three major parts: a cell body, or soma, which contains the nucleus of the cell and keeps the cell alive; a branching, treelike fiber known as the dendrite, which collects information from other cells and sends the information to the soma; and a long, segmented fiber known as the axon, which transmits information away from the cell body toward other neurons or to the muscles and glands.",cell body,80,88
1,1,"If the signal reaches the terminal buttons, they are signaled to emit chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which communicate with other neurons across the spaces between the cells, known as synapses.",synapse,191,197
1,1,You will be learning more about synapses and why they are important later on in this module.,synapse,32,38

1,1,"The axons are also specialized, and some, such as those that send messages from the spinal cord to the muscles in the hands or feet, may be very longâ€”even up to several feet in length.",axon,4,7
1,1,"To improve the speed of their communication, and to keep their electrical charges from shorting out with other neurons, axons are often surrounded by a myelin sheath.",axon,120,123
1,1,The myelin sheath is a layer of fatty tissue surrounding the axon of a neuron that both acts as an insulator and allows faster transmission of the electrical signal.,axon,61,64
1,1,"Within the neuron, when a signal is received by the dendrites, it is transmitted to the soma in the form of an electrical signal, and if the signal is strong enough, it may then be passed to the axon and then to the terminal buttons.",axon,195,198
