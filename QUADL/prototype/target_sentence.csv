1,1,"As you can see in the following figure, neurons consist of three major parts: a cell body, or soma, which contains the nucleus of the cell and keeps the cell alive; a branching, treelike fiber known as the dendrite, which collects information from other cells and sends the information to the soma; and a long, segmented fiber known as the axon, which transmits information away from the cell body toward other neurons or to the muscles and glands.","Identify the basic structures of a neuron, the function of each structure, and how messages travel through the neuron.",['340'],['343'],axon,11.29664
