1,1,Dendrites receive signals from other neurons via,synapse
1,1,This information is then processed in the ,cell body
1,1,"and if the signal is strong enough, the message is pushed through and travels down the",axon
1,1,The signal travels to the end of the axon to the,terminal button
1,1,where another signal triggers,neurotransmitters
1,1,"to be released, passing through the synaptic cleft onto the",dendrites
1,1,Signals from other neurons are received at the  dendrites  and  the cell body of a receiving neuron,dentirites
1,1,Signals from other neurons are received at the  dendrites  and  the cell body of a receiving neuron,cell body
1,1,The space between a sending and receiving neuron is called a  synapse.,synapse
1,1,"When a neuron receives a signal, it travels down the dendrite to the  cell body, where it is processed.",cell body
1,1,"If the signal exceeds the threshold, it is pushed out of the cell body and down the  axon towards the  synapse between this neuron and the next one.",axon
1,1,"If the signal exceeds the threshold, it is pushed out of the cell body and down the  axon towards the  synapse between this neuron and the next one.",synapse
1,1,"he signal travels to the end of the axon, called the terminal button , where the signal travels across the synapse to the next neuron.",terminal button
