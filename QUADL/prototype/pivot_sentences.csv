1,1,"Within the neuron, when a signal is received by the dendrites, it is transmitted to the soma in the form of an electrical signal, and if the signal is strong enough, it may then be passed to the axon and then to the terminal buttons.","and if the signal is strong enough, the message is pushed through and travels down the",['195'],['198'],axon,11.174083
1,1,"As you can see in the following figure, neurons consist of three major parts: a cell body, or soma, which contains the nucleus of the cell and keeps the cell alive; a branching, treelike fiber known as the dendrite, which collects information from other cells and sends the information to the soma; and a long, segmented fiber known as the axon, which transmits information away from the cell body toward other neurons or to the muscles and glands.",This information is then processed in the,['80'],['88'],cell body,9.563688
1,1,"If the signal reaches the terminal buttons, they are signaled to emit chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which communicate with other neurons across the spaces between the cells, known as synapses.",where another signal triggers,['89'],['105'],neurotransmitters,8.7461
1,1,"If the signal reaches the terminal buttons, they are signaled to emit chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which communicate with other neurons across the spaces between the cells, known as synapses.","If the signal exceeds the threshold, it is pushed out of the cell body and down the  axon towards the  synapse between this neuron and the next one.",['191'],['197'],synapse,11.474874
1,1,"Within the neuron, when a signal is received by the dendrites, it is transmitted to the soma in the form of an electrical signal, and if the signal is strong enough, it may then be passed to the axon and then to the terminal buttons.","he signal travels to the end of the axon, called the terminal button , where the signal travels across the synapse to the next neuron.",['216'],['230'],terminal button,12.149681
