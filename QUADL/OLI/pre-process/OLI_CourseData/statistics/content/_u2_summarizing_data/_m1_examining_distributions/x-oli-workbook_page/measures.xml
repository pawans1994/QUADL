<p>The overall pattern of the distribution of a quantitative variable is described by its shape,
                                    center, and spread. By inspecting the histogram, we can describe
                                    the shape of the distribution, but as we saw, we can only get a
                                    rough estimate for the center and spread. A description of the
                                    distribution of a quantitative variable must include, in
                                    addition to the graphical display, a more precise numerical
                                    description of the center and spread of the distribution. In
                                    this section we will learn: </p>
<ul>
<li>how to quantify the center and spread of a distribution with various numerical measures; </li>
<li>some of the properties of those numerical measures; and </li>
<li>how to choose the appropriate numerical measures of center and spread to supplement the histogram. </li>
</ul>
