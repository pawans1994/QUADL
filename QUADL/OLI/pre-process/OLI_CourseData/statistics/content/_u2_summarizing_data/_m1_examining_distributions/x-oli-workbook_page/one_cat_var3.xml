                  <p>While both the pie chart and the bar chart help us visualize the distribution
                     of a categorical variable, the pie chart emphasizes how the different
                     categories relate to the whole, and the bar chart emphasizes how the different
                     categories compare with each other.</p>

                  <p>A variation on the pie chart and bar chart that is very commonly used in the
                     media is the <em>pictogram</em>. Here are two examples:</p>

replaced by rolls of unraveled toilet paper. The chart is titled &quot;How we flush a public toilet&quot;
The first bar is labeled &quot;Use shoe, 41%&quot;, the second bar is labeled &quot;Act normally 30%&quot;,
and the last bar is labeled &quot;Paper towel 17%&quot;"/>

3-6 times (47%)."/>

                     <em>Beware:</em> Pictograms can be misleading. Consider the following
                     pictogram:</p>
                  <image style="block" src="../webcontent/one_cat_var5.jpg"
                     alt="A chart in which three items are represented
by the size of a fountain pen. The chart is labeled &quot;No. 1 for the Money with Consumer Services
Advertisers&quot; The smallest pen is U.S. News $1,537,617. The second smallest pen is Newsweek $2,698,386.
The largest pen is TIME $4,433,879."/>
                  <p>This graph is aimed at advertisers deciding where to spend their budgets, and
                     clearly suggests that <em style="italic">Time</em> magazine attracts by far the
                     largest amount of advertising spending. Are the differences really as dramatic
                     as the graph suggests? If we look carefully at the numbers above the pens, we
                     find that advertisers spend in <em style="italic">Time</em> only $4,433,879 /
                     $2,698,386 = 1.64 times more than in <em style="italic">Newsweek</em>, and only
                     $4,433,879 / $1,537,617 = 2.88 times more than in <em style="italic">U.S.
                        News</em>. By looking at the pictogram, however, we get the impression that
                        <em style="italic">Time</em> is much further ahead. Why? In order to magnify
                     the picture without distorting it, we must increase <em style="italic"
                        >both</em> its height and width. As a result, the <em>area</em> of <em
                        style="italic">Time's</em> pen is 1.64 * 1.64 = 2.7 times larger than the
                        <em style="italic">Newsweek</em> pen, and 2.88 * 2.88 = 8.3 times larger
                     than the <em style="italic">U.S. News</em> pen. Our eyes capture the area of
                     the pens rather than only the height, and so we are misled to think that <em
                        style="italic">Time</em> is a bigger winner than it really is.</p>
