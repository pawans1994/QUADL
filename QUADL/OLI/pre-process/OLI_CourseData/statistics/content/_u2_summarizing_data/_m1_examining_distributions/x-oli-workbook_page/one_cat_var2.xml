<title>One Categorical Variable (2 of 3)</title>
  <objref idref="summarize_categorical_distribution"/>
 </head>
<body>
  
  <p>In order to visualize the numerical summaries we've obtained, we need a graphical display.  There are two simple graphical displays for visualizing the distribution of categorical data:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The Pie Chart
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/one_cat_var1.gif" alt="A pie chart of the distribution. Taking up
71.3% of the chart is the &quot;about right&quot; category, which is labeled with &quot;about right
(855, 71.3%)&quot;. Another 9.2% of the chart os occupied by the section labeled &quot;underweight
(110, 9.2%)&quot;, and taking up 19.6% of the chart is the area labeled &quot;overweight (235,
19.6%)&quot;. In total the three sections fill up the entire pie, so they make up 100% of the chart,
which represents the entirety of the data."/>
</li>
<li>The Bar
        <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101015T143346-0400" comment="Change &quot;for&quot; to &quot;of&quot; in both bar charts

Change &quot;percents&quot; to &quot;percentage&quot; in second bar chart"?>Chart
          <?oxy_comment_end?>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/one_cat_var2.gif" alt="Two bar charts. Since these bar charts can
only show one type of unit on the vertical axis, two are required, one to show counts and one to show
percentages. The first bar chart shows counts on the vertical axis, from 0 to 900. The horizontal axis
has 3 labels under 3 bars. The largest bar is labeled &quot;about right&quot; and is the largest. It
extends from the 0 mark on the vertical axis to between the 800 and 900 mark. The second bar is labeled
&quot;overweight&quot; and starts at the 0 mark and ends at about the 200 mark. The third bar is
labeled &quot;underweight&quot; and starts at the 0 mark and ends between the 100 and 200 mark. The
second bar chart is identical to the first one, except the vertical axis has been changed to Percent units, and
goes from 0 to 70. The bars are the same as in the first chart."/>
</li>

<p> Now that we have summarized the distribution of values in the Body Image variable, let's go back
                  and interpret the results in the context of the questions that we posed: </p>
<wb:inline idref="u1_m1_onecatvar2_tutor2" purpose="learnbydoing"/>
<!--<flash src="../../webcontent/flash/one_cat_var2q2.swf" width="505" height="240" purpose="learnbydoing">
<param name="problem_name">one_cat_var2q2</param>
</flash>-->
<p>
Now that we've interpreted the results, there are some other interesting questions that arise:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we reliably generalize our results to the entire population of interest and conclude that a
                        similar distribution across body image categories exists among all U.S.
                        college students? In particular, can we make such a generalization even
                        though our sample consisted of only 1,200 students, which is a very small
                        fraction of the entire population?</li>
<li>If we had separated our sample by gender and looked at males and females separately, would
we have found a similar distribution across body image categories?</li>
</ul>
<p> These are the types of questions that we will deal with in future sections of the course. </p>
