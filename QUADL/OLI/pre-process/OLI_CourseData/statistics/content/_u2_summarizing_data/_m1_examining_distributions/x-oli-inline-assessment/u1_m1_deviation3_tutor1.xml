            <feedback>Incorrect. Since the SD of this distribution is 3, 333 and 339 are exactly one standard deviation below and above the mean, 336. The standard deviation rule tells us that only 68% of horse pregnancies last in that range of lengths.</feedback>

            <feedback>Incorrect. Since the SD of this distribution is 3, 330 and 342 are exactly two standard deviations below and above the mean, 336. The standard deviation rule tells us that only 95% of horse pregnancies last in that range of lengths.</feedback>

         <response match="Res5" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct. The Standard Deviation Rule tells us that virtually all the data
               fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean, which in this case is exactly between
               336 − 3(3) = 327, and 336 + 3(3) = 345.</feedback>

            <feedback>Incorrect. According to the SD rule, 68% of horse pregnancies last
               between 336 − 3 = 333 and 336 + 3 = 339 days, which means that the remaining 32% of
               horse pregnancies are divided evenly between lasting less than 333 days and lasting
               more than 339 days.<!--Correct. According to the SD rule, 68% of horse pregnancies last between 336
               − 3 = 333 and 336 + 3 = 339 days, which means that the remaining 32% of horse
               pregnancies are divided evenly between lasting less than 333 days and lasting more
               than 339 days. We therefore conclude that 16% of horse pregnancies last more than 339
