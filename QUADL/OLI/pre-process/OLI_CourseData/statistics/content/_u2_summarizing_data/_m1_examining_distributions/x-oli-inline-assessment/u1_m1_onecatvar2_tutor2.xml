   <p>What do the results suggest about how the students are divided across the three body image categories?</p>
   <!--The results suggest that the students <input_ref input="A"/> equally divided across the three
            body image categories. The vast majority of students (71.3%) feel that they are
               <input_ref input="B"/>. Among the remainder of the students, more students (19.6%)
            feel that they are <input_ref input="C"/> and the body perception that occurred the
            least often was <input_ref input="D"/> (9.2%).-->

            <feedback>Incorrect. Since the pieces of the pie and the lengths of the three bars representing the three body image categories are quite different, the students' responses are not equally divided among the categories.</feedback>

            <feedback>Correct. You correctly saw that the pieces of the pie and the lengths of the three bars representing the three body image categories are not all the same. Thus, the students' responses are not equally divided among the categories.</feedback>
