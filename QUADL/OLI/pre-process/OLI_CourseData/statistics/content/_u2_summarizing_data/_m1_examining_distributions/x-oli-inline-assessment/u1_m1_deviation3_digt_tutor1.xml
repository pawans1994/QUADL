         <p>The body temperatures of dogs are normally distributed with a mean of 101.3&#176;F and a
            standard deviation of 0.6&#176;F. Use this information to answer the following
            questions:</p>
         <p>About 95% of the temperatures of dogs fall within which range?</p>

            <feedback>Incorrect. Using the figures given for the mean and standard
               deviation, 99.5 and 103.1 are within 3 SD of the mean. According to the Standard
               Deviation Rule, 99.7% of the temperatures are in this range.<!--Correct. The Standard Deviation Rule tells us that 95% of the temperatures
               fall within 2 SD of the mean. In this case, this is between 101.3 − 2(0.6) = 100.1 and
               101.3 + 2(0.6) = 102.5.--></feedback>

            <feedback>Correct. According to the SD rule, 99.7% of dog temperatures are between
               101.3 − 3(0.6) = 99.5 and 101.3 + 3(0.6) = 103.1&#176;F, which means that the
               remaining 0.3% of temperatures are divided evenly between less than
               99.5&#176;F and more than 103.1&#176;F. We therefore conclude that
               0.15% of temperatures are less than 99.5&#176;F.</feedback>

         <response match="Res5" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct. Since 100.1&#176;F is 2 SD below the mean, the percentage
               between 2 SD below the mean and 2 SD above the mean is 95%. This means that 95% of
               the temperatures are between 101.3 − 2(0.6) = 100.1 and 101.3 + 2(0.6) = 102.5. The
               remaining 5% is divided evenly between below 100.1 and above 102.5&#176;F.
               Therefore, the percentage that is more than 100.1 is 95% + 2.5% = 97.5%.</feedback>
