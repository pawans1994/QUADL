        <p>Now that you understand what each of the five numbers means, you can appreciate how much
            information about the distribution is packed into the five-number summary. All this
            information can also be represented visually by using the boxplot. </p>

            <title>The Boxplot</title>
            <body>
                <p>The boxplot graphically represents the distribution of a quantitative variable by
                    visually displaying the five-number summary and any observation that was
                    classified as a suspected outlier using the 1.5(IQR) criterion. </p>
                <!-- This is new, added 07-01-2016 -->
                <p>There are several ways to plot the whiskers on a boxplot. One convention is to
                    plot whiskers down to the minimum and up to the maximum value. We use the
                    1.5(IQR criterion), also known as the Tukey method for plotting whiskers. First,
                    calculate the IQR, the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles (or Q3 –
                    Q1). Multiply the IQR by 1.5. Add this value to the 75th percentile. If the
                    value is greater than (or equal to) the maximum value in the dataset, draw the
                    upper whisker to the maximum value. Otherwise, stop the whisker at the largest
                    value that is less than 75th percentile + 1.5 * IQR. Plot any values that are
                    greater than this as individual points that are outliers. Similarly, subtract
                    1.5 * IQR from the 25th percentile. If this value is smaller than the minimum
                    value in the dataset, draw the lower whisker to the minimum value. Otherwise,
                    stop the whisker at the lowest value that is greater than 25th percentile – 1.5
                    * IQR. Plot any values that are smaller than this as individual points that are
                    outliers.</p>
                <p>Using the Best Actress dataset, here is how we determine where to draw the
                    whiskers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Q3 = 42</li>
                    <li>Q1 = 30.5</li>
                    <li>IQR: 42 – 30.5 = 11.5</li>
                    <li>1.5 * IQR = 1.5 * 11.5 = 17.25</li>
                    <li>Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 42 + 17.25 = 59.25</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The largest observation that is less than or equal to 59.25 is 49 so we draw the
                    upper whisker up to 49. All points above 49 are considered outliers (61, 61, 62,
                    74, 80).</p>
                <p>Q1 – 1.5 * IQR = 30.5 – 17.25 = 13.25</p>
                <p>The smallest observation that is greater than or equal to 13.5 is 21 so we draw
                    the lower whisker down to 21, which is also the minimum. There are no
                    outliers.</p>
