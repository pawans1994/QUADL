         <p>The Web site www.kiplinger.compublished the "Best Values in Public Colleges," saying
            they were determined by rankings based on data from more than 500 public four-year
            colleges and universities. Using out-of-state rankings that considered the academic
            quality, total out-of-state costs, and average costs after financial aid, the 50
            best-rated colleges were selected. The boxplot pictured displays the average debt per
            graduate for these colleges.</p>
