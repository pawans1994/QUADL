	<background>A student survey was conducted at a major university. Data were collected from a
		random sample of 239 undergraduate students, and the information that was collected included
		physical characteristics (such as height, handedness etc.), study habits, academic
		performance and attitudes, and social behaviors. In this exercise we will focus on exploring
		relationships between some of those variables. Note that a) these are
		&lt;b&gt;<?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101019T190745-0400" comment="use italics instead of bold for emphasis"?>real<?oxy_comment_end?>&lt;/b&gt;
		data, and b) the symbol * in the worksheet means that this observation is not available
		(this is known as a 'missing value').&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Click the
		&lt;b&gt;Questions&lt;/b&gt; tab to see the questions about this problem that we will try to
