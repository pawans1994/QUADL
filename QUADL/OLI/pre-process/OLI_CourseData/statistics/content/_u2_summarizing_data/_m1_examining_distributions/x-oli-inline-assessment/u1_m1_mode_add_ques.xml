         <p>The mode of the readability level for the pamphlets is <input_ref input="B"/>

         <response input="B" name="8" match="one" score="10">
            <feedback>Good Job! Indeed the readability level that occurs with the highest frequency
               (8) corresponds to grade level 8 </feedback>
         </response>
         <response input="B" name="greater_than_16" match="two">
            <feedback>Incorrect. 16 is the largest value of the readability level. You
               are looking for the readability level that occurs with the highest frequency (i.e.,
               has the largest count).</feedback>
         </response>
         <response input="B" name="1" match="three">
            <feedback>Incorrect. You are looking for the readability level that occurs
               with the highest frequency (i.e., has the largest count).</feedback>
         </response>
         <response input="B" name="17" match="four">
            <feedback>Incorrect. You are looking for the readability level that
               occurs with the highest frequency (i.e., has the largest count).</feedback>
         </response>
      </part>
      <hint>Remember, the mode is the most frequently occurring score. </hint>
      <hint>Note: The data are grouped, so make sure you consider the counts. Since the mode is the
         most frequently occurring value, what reading level for the cancer patients, has the
         highest count?</hint>
