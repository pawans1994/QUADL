                  <p>* When some of the stems hold a large number of leaves, we can split each stem
                        into two:

Also, shouldn&apos;t there be another 8 in the diagram below on the stem side?"?>one
                        holding the leaves 0-4, and the other<?oxy_comment_end?> holding the leaves
                        5-9. A statistical software package will often do the splitting for you,
                        when appropriate. </p>
                  <p>
                        <em>Note </em>that when rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, the stemplot
                        visually resembles a histogram:</p>
                  <image style="block" src="../webcontent/stemplot2.gif" alt="A rotated stem plot.
This is the same as the last stem plot given in the previous image, but rotated so that the stems
are at the bottom, with the leaves on top."/>
                  <p>This orientation makes the right-skewedness of the distribution clearly
                        visible.</p>
            </example>
            <p>The stemplot has additional unique features:</p>
            <ul>
                  <li> It preserves the original data.</li>
                  <li> It sorts the data (which will become very useful in the next section).</li>

                        <p>There is another type of display that we can use to summarize a
                              quantitative variable graphically&#8212;the <em>dotplot</em>. The
                              dotplot, like the stemplot, shows each observation, but displays it
                              with a dot rather than with its actual value. Here is the dotplot for
                              the ages of Best Actress Oscar winners. </p>
                        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/stemplot3.gif" alt="A dotplot titled
&quot;Dotplot of Age&quot; A number line is at the bottom of the image, labeled in units of age from 24 to 80.
At each age on the number line the a line of dots, each representing one winner of that age, appears above the
place of that age on the number line."/>

                        <p>The stemplot is a simple but useful visual display of quantitative data.
                              Its principal virtues are:</p>
                        <ul>
                              <li>Easy and quick to construct for small, simple datasets.</li>
                              <li>Retains the actual data.</li>
                              <li>Sorts (ranks) the data.</li>
