            <title>Center</title>
            <body>
                <p>The center of the distribution is its <em>midpoint</em>&#8212;the value that
                    divides the distribution so that approximately half the observations take
                    smaller values, and approximately half the observations take larger values. Note
                    that from looking at the histogram we can get only a rough estimate for the
                    center of the distribution. (More exact ways of finding measures of center will
                    be discussed in the next section.)</p>
                <p>Recall our grades example:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/histogram1.gif"
                    alt="The exam grades histogram. The y-axis is labeled count, and the x-axis is labeled score. There is 1 count
                    in 40-50 score interval, 2 counts in the 50-60 score interval, 4 counts in the 60-70 score interval,
                    5 counts in the 70-80 score interval, 2 counts in the 80-90 score interval, and 1 count in the 90-100 score interval."/>

                <p>As you can see from the histogram, the center of the grades distribution is
                    roughly 70 (7 students scored below 70, and 8 students scored above 70).</p>

            <title>Spread</title>
            <body>
                <p>The <em>spread</em> (also called <em>variability</em>) of the distribution can be
                    described by the approximate range covered by the data. From looking at the
                    histogram, we can approximate the smallest observation (<em>min</em>), and the
                    largest observation (<em>max</em>), and thus approximate the range. (More exact
                    ways of finding measures of spread are discussed in the next section.)</p>
                <p>In our example: </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Approximate min:</td>
                        <td>45 (the middle of the lowest interval of scores)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Approximate max:</td>
                        <td>95 (the middle of the highest interval of scores)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Approximate range:</td>
                        <td>95 âˆ’ 45 = 50</td>

                <p>
                    <em>Outliers</em> are observations that fall outside the overall pattern. For
                    example, the following histogram represents a distribution that has a high
                    probable outlier:</p>

                    alt="A histogram with frequency on the Y-axis.
As we go from left to right on the x-axis, the frequency increases to a peak at x=5, then decreases.
Eventually, we reach 0 at x=11. All of x > 10 have a frequency of 0, exception for x=15, which has a
frequency of greater than zero. This is a outlier."/>
                <p>Go back and check the histogram of scores at the top of this page. As you can
                    see, there are no outliers.</p>

                    <p>To provide an example of a histogram applied to actual data, we will look at
                        the ages of Best Actress Oscar winners from 1970 to 2013 (To see the full

x=74,y=1; x=80, y=1"/>-->
                    <p>We will now summarize the main features of the distribution of ages as it
                        appears from the histogram:</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Shape:</em> The distribution of ages is skewed right. We have a
                        concentration of data among the younger ages and a long tail to the right.
                        The vast majority of the "best actress" awards are given to young actresses,
                        with very few awards given to actresses who are older.</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Center:</em> The data seem to be centered around 34 or 35 years old.
                        Note that this implies that roughly half the awards are given to actresses
                        who are less than 34 years old.</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Spread:</em> The data range from about 20 to about 80, so the
                        approximate range equals 80 - 20 = 60.</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Outliers:</em> There seem to be two probable outliers to the far right
                        and possibly three around 62 years old.</p>
                    <p>You can see how informative it is to know "what to look at" in a histogram.
                        If there is one conclusion that we can make here, it is that Hollywood likes
                        to give Oscars to young actresses.</p>

            <title>Let's Summarize</title>
            <body>
                <ul>
                    <li>The histogram is a graphical display of the distribution of a quantitative
                        variable. It plots the number (count) of observations that fall in intervals
                        of values.</li>
                    <li>When examining the distribution of a quantitative variable, one should
                        describe the overall pattern of the data (shape, center, spread), and any
                        deviations from the pattern (outliers). </li>
                    <li>When describing the shape of a distribution, one should consider: <ul>
                            <li>Symmetry/skewness of the distribution </li>
                            <li>Peakedness (modality)&#8212;the number of peaks (modes) the
                                distribution has.</li>
                        </ul>Not all distributions have a simple, recognizable shape. </li>
                    <li>Outliers are data points that fall outside the overall pattern of the
                        distribution and need further research before continuing the analysis.</li>
                    <li>It is always important to interpret what the features of the distribution
                        (as they appear in the histogram) mean in the context of the data.</li>
                </ul>
