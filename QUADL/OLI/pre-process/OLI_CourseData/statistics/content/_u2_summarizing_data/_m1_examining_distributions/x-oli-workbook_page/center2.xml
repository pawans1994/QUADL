   <title>Comparing the Mean and the Median</title>
   <body>
    <p>As we have seen, mean and the median, two of the common measures of center, each describe the
     center of a distribution of values in a different way. The mean describes the center as an
     average value, in which the <em style="italic">actual values</em> of the data points play an
     important role. The median, on the other hand, locates the middle value as the center, and the
      <em style="italic">order</em> of the data is the key to finding it.</p>
    <p>To get a deeper understanding of the differences between these two measures of center,
     consider the following example. </p>
    <p>Here are two datasets: </p>
    <table>
     <tr>
      <td>Data set A → 64 65 66 68 70 71 <em>73</em>
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Data set B → 64 65 66 68 70 71 <em>730</em>
      </td>
     </tr>
    </table>
    <p>For dataset A, the mean is 68.1, and the median is 68. Looking at dataset B, notice that all
     of the observations except the last one are close together. The observation 730 is very large,
     and is certainly an outlier. In this case, the median is still 68, but the mean will be
     influenced by the high outlier, and shifted up to 162. The message that we should take from
     this example is:</p>
    <p>
     <em>The mean is very sensitive to outliers (because it factors in their magnitude), while the
      median is resistant to outliers. </em>
    </p>
    <p> Therefore:</p>
    <p> - For symmetric distributions with no outliers: <m:math overflow="scroll">
      <m:mrow>
       <m:mover>
        <m:mi>x</m:mi>
        <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
       </m:mover>
      </m:mrow>
     </m:math> is approximately equal to M. </p>

     alt="A unimodal, symmetric

    <p> - For skewed right distributions and/or datasets with high outliers: <m:math
      overflow="scroll">
      <m:mrow>
       <m:mover>
        <m:mi>x</m:mi>
        <m:mo>¯</m:mo>

       <m:mtext> </m:mtext>
       <m:mo>&gt;</m:mo>

    <p> - For skewed left distributions and/or datasets with low outliers: <m:math overflow="scroll">
      <m:mrow>
       <m:mover>
        <m:mi>x</m:mi>

    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/center6.gif"
     alt="A skewed-left distribution. The
mean=69, and the median=72. The mode is at about x=78."/>
    <p>We will therefore use <m:math overflow="scroll">
      <m:mrow>
       <m:mover>
        <m:mi>x</m:mi>
        <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
       </m:mover>
      </m:mrow>
     </m:math> as a measure of center for symmetric distributions with no outliers. Otherwise, the
     median will be a more appropriate measure of the center of our data.</p>

   <title>Let's Summarize</title>
   <body>
    <ul>
     <li>The three main numerical measures for the center of a distribution are the mode, mean
       (<m:math overflow="scroll">
       <m:mrow>
        <m:mover>
         <m:mi>x</m:mi>
         <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
        </m:mover>
       </m:mrow>
      </m:math>), and the median (M). The mode is the most frequently occurring value. The mean is
      the average value, while the median is the middle value.</li>
     <li>The mean is very sensitive to outliers (as it factors in their magnitude), while the median
      is resistant to outliers.</li>
     <li>The mean is an appropriate measure of center only for symmetric distributions with no
      outliers. In all other cases, the median should be used to describe the center of the
      distribution.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Prior to doing the checkpoint, you might want to do some additional problems that cover how to
   determine a median, mean, shape, relationship between a mean and median, and percentage of scores
   for a given value(s) from a histogram.</p>
