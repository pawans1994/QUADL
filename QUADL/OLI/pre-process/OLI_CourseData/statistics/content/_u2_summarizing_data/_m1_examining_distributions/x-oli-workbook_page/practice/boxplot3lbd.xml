        <p>The objectives of this activity are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To teach you how to use <pref:label preference="statistics.package"/> to produce
                side-by-side boxplots and the relevant descriptive statistics,</li>
            <li>To let you practice comparing and contrasting distributions, and</li>
            <li>To help you gain more intuition about variability through the interpretation of your
                results in context.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The percentage of each entering Freshman class that graduated on time was recorded for
            each of six colleges at a major university over a period of several years. (Source: This
            data is distributed with the software package, Data Desk. (1993). Ithaca, NY: Data
            Description, Inc., and appears in http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/DASL/)</p>
        <p>In order to compare the graduation rates among the different colleges, we will create
            side-by-side boxplots (graduation rate by college), and supplement the graph with
            numerical measures. Follow the instructions, and then answer the questions based on the
            output you got. </p>

                    <p>The data have been loaded into the data frame <code>grad_data</code>. Enter
                        the command <code>grad_data</code> to see the data. There are 6 variables
                        (column titles) in the data frame <code>grad_data</code>:
                            <code>College.A</code>, <code>College.B</code>, <code>College.C</code>,
                            <code>College.D</code>, <code>College.E</code>, and
                            <code>College.F</code>.</p>
                    <p>You should see graduation data for six colleges over the past eight years.

                    <p>By using the <code>summary()</code> command on the data frame instead of an
                        individual variable, the summary statement of the five-number summary and
                        mean are provided for each variable in the data frame.</p>
                    <p>Finally, copy the next command to see side-by-side boxplots of the graduation
                        data for the six colleges:</p>
                    <code style="inline">boxplot(grad_data)</code>

                    <p>Just as we did with the histogram, we can add x-axis and y-axis labels and
                        titles using the same additional parameters in the <code>boxplot()</code>
                        command, <code>xlab=</code>, <code>ylab=</code>, and <code>main=</code>. For
                        example:</p>
                    <code style="inline">boxplot(grad_data, xlab="Colleges",ylab ="Graduation
                        Rates", main="Comparison of Graduation Rates")</code>
                    <p>We can also modify the direction of the boxes by adding another parameter
                            <code>horizontal=TRUE</code>. For example:</p>
                    <code style="inline">boxplot(grad_data, horizontal=TRUE, ylab="Colleges",xlab
                        ="Graduation Rates", main="Comparison of Graduation Rates")</code>
                    <p>Notice that you must switch the x- and y-axis labels when you make a
                        horizontal boxplot.</p>
                    <p><em style="bold">Note:</em> Using R—Use the mouse to grab the corner of the
                        graph window and change its shape. If you make the window wider, you see a
                        label for each boxplot. While the graph window is the active window, try
                        clicking the <em style="bold">File</em> menu. If you hold the mouse over
                        "Copy to Clipboard," you see two ways that you can copy a graph for pasting
                        into another document. This is how you use R to create data graphs for
                        reports.</p>

                    <p><em style="bold">R coding Note for reference only:</em> The above command
                        works because all six variables are listed in separate columns. Data
                        organization often plays a role in how you structure an R command. For
                        example, if the data was instead organized into two columns
                            <code>GradRate</code> and <code>College</code> in a new data frame
                        called <code>grad2</code>, where <code>GradRate</code> contained all the
                        numeric responses and <code>College</code> contained the labels <em
                            style="italic">A, B, C,</em> etc., then the code would be as follows: </p>
                    <code style="inline">boxplot(grad2$GradRate~grad2$College)</code>

                    <p><em>Descriptive Statistics:</em></p>
                    <p>In the last Learn By Doing exercise, we calculated descriptive statistics for
                        our entire dataset. This time, we want to calculate descriptive statistics
                            <em>for each college</em> and then create side-by-side boxplots to
                        compare the colleges graphically.</p>
                    <p>To start, we'll create a table that will list each statistical measure and
                        the value for each college. When you are done, your table should look like
                        this:</p>
                    <p><image src="../../../webcontent/excel_instructions/boxplot3lbd1_new_1.gif"
                        /></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To create this table, first make the row and column labels: in an empty
                            section of your worksheet, pick a cell and type <em>Statistic</em>. Then
                            move one cell to the right and type <em>College A</em>. Move one cell to
                            the right and type <em>College B</em>. Keep doing this for colleges C,
                            D, E, and F. Now, in the cell underneath <em>Statistic</em>, type
                                <em>min</em>. Move down one cell and type <em>Q1</em>, then
                            underneath that <em>Median</em>, then <em>Q3</em>, and finally
                                <em>Max</em>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now for each statistic, we'll enter the formula to calculate that statistic
                        and the range of data that corresponds to each college:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>min</em></li>
                        <li>In the cell to the right of <em>min</em> and underneath <em>College
                                A</em>, type <em>=min(B2:B9)</em> because B2 through B9 represents
                            the data for College A.</li>
                        <li>Now move one cell to the right (so that you're underneath <em>College
                                B</em>, and type <em>=min(B10:B17)</em> because B10 through B17
                            represents the data for College B.</li>
                        <li>Repeat this calculation for colleges C, D, E, and F, adjusting the data
                            range appropriately for each college.</li>
                        <li><em>IMPORTANT:</em> Instead of typing the cell numbers inside of the
                            parentheses, it is better to highlight the relevant cells with your
                            mouse after typing <em>=min(</em> (by holding a left click as you
                            highlight the cells).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Q1</em></li>
                        <li>In the cell to the right of <em>Q1</em> and underneath <em>College

                    <p>
                        <em>Side-by-Side Boxplots:</em></p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, Excel can't create boxplots directly, so we have to create a
                        column graph and alter it so that we get boxplots. We start by using our
                        Descriptive Statistics to create a new table that will be the basis for our
                        column graph. When you are done, your table should look like this:</p>
                    <p><image src="../../../webcontent/excel_instructions/boxplot3lbd1_new_3.gif"
                        /></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To create this table, first make the row and column labels: in an empty
                            section of your worksheet, pick a cell and type <em>Statistic</em>. Then
                            move one cell to the right and type <em>College A</em>. Move one cell to
                            the right and type <em>College B</em>. Keep doing this for colleges C,
                            D, E, and F. Now, in the cell underneath <em>Statistic</em>, type
                                <em>25th Percentile</em> . Move down one cell and type <em>50th
                                Percentile</em> , then underneath that <em>75th Percentile</em>,
                            then <em>Lower limit</em> , and finally <em>Upper limit</em> .</li>
                        <li>The <em>25th Percentile</em> values are the same as those for Q1, so
                            select the values for Q1, right-click and select <em>Copy</em>, and then
                            select the empty cells in the <em>25th Percentile</em> row and
                            right-click and select <em>Paste Special</em> . In the pop-up window,
                            choose <em>Values</em> and click <em>OK</em> .</li>
                        <li>The <em>50th Percentile</em> values are equal to <em>Median - Q1</em> ,
                            so enter the necessary formulas to calculate those values from the
                            values in your Descriptive Statistics table. For example, if the value
                            for College A Median is in cell M4, and the value for College A Q1 is in
                            cell M3, the correct formula for calculating the 50th Percentile for
                            College A would be <em>=M4-M3</em>.</li>
                        <li><em>IMPORTANT:</em> There is a shortcut for filling in the values for
                            the rest of the table. First, ensure that you have entered the formula
                            correctly as described for College A (check the example table). Also be
                            sure that your new table is directly below your first table for
                            descriptive statistics. Once you have the formula entered for College A,
                            highlight that cell and move your mouse over the square in the bottom
                            right corner. Drag your mouse to the right until you have reached the
                            cell under College F. If you have done this correctly all the cells
                            should now be filled with the correct values.</li>
                        <li>The <em>75th Percentile</em> values are equal to <em>Q3 -
                            Median</em>.</li>
                        <li>The <em>Lower limit</em> values are equal to <em>Q1 - min</em>.</li>
                        <li>The <em>Upper limit</em> values are equal to <em>Max - Q3</em>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now we can finally create our boxplots:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Highlight the first few rows in your table&#8212;the column label row as
                            well as the values in the <em>25th Percentile</em>, <em>50th
                                Percentile</em>, and <em>75th Percentile</em> rows, and then choose
                                <em>Column (the picture of bar graphs)</em> in the <em>Charts</em>
                            group on the <em>Insert</em> tab.</li>
                        <li>In the pull-down menu, choose the second option under <em>2-D
                                Column</em> (labeled <em>Stacked Column</em> if you hover your mouse
                            over it).</li>
                        <li>Excel will create a stacked column graph for you. The idea here is that
                            the top two boxes in each column will make up our boxplots. We'll add
                            error bars for the min and Max values, and simply remove the bottom
                            box.</li>
                        <li>Click on the top box in one of the columns to select it, and then press
                            the <em>Add Chart Elements</em> button and choose <em>Error Bars -&gt;
                                More Error Bars Options</em> in the <em>Chart Layouts</em> group on
                            the <em>Design (Chart Tools)</em> tab.</li>
                        <li>In the pop-up window, choose <em>Vertical Error Bars</em> on the left
                            and then choose <em>Plus</em> on the right.</li>
                        <li>Choose <em>Custom</em> under <em>Error Amount</em> and then click the
                                <em>Specify Value</em> button.</li>
                        <li>In the pop-up window, in the <em>Positive Error Value</em> box, enter
                            the range of values in the <em>Upper limit</em> row in the table we
                            created (or click and drag to select those values). Click <em>OK</em>
                            and then <em>Close</em>.</li>
                        <li>Now repeat this error bar exercise for the bottom box in the columns,
                            except choose <em>Minus</em> error bars, and enter the range of values
                            in the <em>Lower limit</em> row of our table into the <em>Negative Error
                                Value</em> box.</li>
                        <li>Right-click on the top box in one of the columns and choose <em>Format
                                Data Series</em>. In the pop-up window that appears to the right,
                            choose <em>Fill</em> on the left, and specify <em>No fill</em>. Then
                            choose <em>Border Color</em> on the left and specify <em>Solid
                            Line</em>.</li>
                        <li>Repeat for the middle box in the columns.</li>
                        <li>Repeat for the bottom box in the columns, except this time specify
                                <em>No fill</em> and <em>No line</em>. This will cause the bottom
                            box to simply disappear.</li>
                        <li>Click on the legend and hit the Delete key to remove it.</li>
                        <li>Click on the horizontal lines in the background of the graph and hit the
                            Delete key to remove them.</li>
                        <li>Finally, right-click on the y-axis, and choose <em>Format Axis</em> from the
                            pop-up menu that appears to the right. Make sure that <em>Axis Options</em> is
                            selected on the left, and then next to <em>Minimum</em> enter <em>30</em> in the textbox.
                            Click <em>Close</em>.</li>

                    <p>In the last Learn By Doing exercise, we calculated descriptive statistics for
                        our entire dataset. This time, we want to calculate descriptive statistics <em>for
                            each college</em> and then create side-by-side
                        boxplots to compare the colleges graphically.</p>
                    <p>To start, we'll create a table that will list each statistical measure and
                        the value for each college. When you are done, your table should look like

                            D, E, and F. Now, in the cell underneath <em>Statistic</em>, type
                                <em>Q1</em>. Move down one cell and type <em>min</em>, then
