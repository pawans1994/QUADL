      <body>
         <p>An instructor asked her students how much time (to the nearest hour) they spent studying
            for the midterm. The data are displayed in the following histogram:</p>

            <feedback>Correct. The histogram displays information about 3 + 9 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 =
               25 students. Out of these 25 students, 6 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 13 studied 6 or more hours
               for the exam, so 13/25 = 0.52 = 52% of the students. Note that it might have been
               easier to count the bars representing less than 6 hours. Thus, the number of students
               who studied 6 or more hours is 25 − (3 + 9) = 25 − 12 = 13 students.</feedback>
