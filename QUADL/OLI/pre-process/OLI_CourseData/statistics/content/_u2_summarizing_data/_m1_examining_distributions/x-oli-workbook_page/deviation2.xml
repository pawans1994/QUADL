<title>The Standard Deviation Rule</title>
<body>
<p>In the previous activity we tried to help you develop better intuition about the concept of
                    standard deviation. The rule that we are about to present, called "The Standard
                    Deviation Rule" (also known as "The Empirical Rule") will hopefully also
                    contribute to building your intuition about this concept.</p>
<p>Consider a symmetric mound-shaped distribution: <image style="block"
                        src="../webcontent/sdgraph1.gif" alt="A symmetric, mound shaped histogram"/>
                    For distributions having this shape (also
                    known as the <em>normal</em> shape), the following rule applies:</p>
<p>
<em>The Standard Deviation Rule:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Approximately 68% of the observations fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean.</li>
<li> Approximately 95% of the observations fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
<li> Approximately 99.7% (or virtually all) of the observations fall within 3 standard deviations of
                        the mean.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following picture illustrates this rule: <image style="block" src="../webcontent/sdgraph2.gif"
    alt="A symmetric, mound shaped histogram. The mean is located at the mode of the histogram (right in
the middle. The middle 68% of observations fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean. This means
that the bars on this histogram representing the 68% of the observations closest to the mean are
have a value that is at most 1 standard deviation from the mean. 95% of the observations fall within
2 standard deviations of the mean. This encompasses more bars which are further from the mean (center
of the histogram) than the center 68% did. Lastly, 99.7% of the observations fall within 3 standard
deviations of the mean. Even more bars are selected."/>
</p>
<p>This rule provides another way to interpret the standard deviation of a distribution, and thus also provides a bit more intuition about it.</p>
<p>To see how this rule works in practice, consider the following example:</p>

</section>
<example>
<title>Male Height</title>
<p>The following histogram represents height (in inches) of 50 males. Note that the data are roughly
                normal, so we would like to see how the Standard Deviation Rule works for this
                example. <image style="block" src="../webcontent/sdgraph3.gif" alt="A symmetric histogram.
The vertical axis is labeled &quot;Frequency&quot; and ranges from 0 to 7. The horizontal axis is labeled
&quot;Height&quot; and ranges from 64 to 72. The mode of the histogram is at around x=71, y=7."/>
            </p>
<p>Below are the actual data, and the numerical summaries of the distribution. Note that the key players here, the mean and standard deviation, have been highlighted.
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/deviation4.gif" alt="Actual Data. &quot;(&quot; Denotes the start of the 2nd
standard deviation, and &quot;)&quot; denotes the end. &quot;[&quot; denotes the start of the 1st standard deviation,
and &quot;]&quot; denotes the end. Data: 64 (66 66 67 67 67 67 [68 68 68 68 68 68 69 69 69 69 69 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
71 71 71 71 71 71 71 72 72 72 72 72 72 73 73 73] 74 74 74 74 74 75 76 76) 77"/>

<p>To see how well the Standard Deviation Rule works for this case, we will find what percentage of
                the observations falls within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean, and
                compare it to what the Standard Deviation Rule tells us this percentage should be.
                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/deviation6.gif" alt="mean-SD=67.7, and
mean+SD=73.4, so this 1st deviation captures 34 out of 50 observations = 68%. The SD rule says 68%
also. mean-2(SD) = 64.9 and mean+2(SD)=76.3, which encompasses 48 out of 50 observations = 96%. The
SD rule says 95%. Mean-3(SD)=62, and mean+3(SD)=79.2, which captures all of the observations = 100%.
The SD rule says 99.7%"/>
            </p>
<p>It turns out the Standard Deviation Rule works
