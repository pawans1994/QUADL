         <response input="A" match="*" score="1"/>
         <hint>To describe the distribution of a variable, discuss the percentages of the sample
            that fall into each category and how those percentages are divided across the
            categories. For example, are they equally divided or is the percentage in one category
            far higher than the others?</hint>
         <explanation>
            <p>The students are <em style="italic">not</em> divided equally among the three categories. About 50% of the students find it as easy
               to make friends with the opposite sex as with the same sex. Among the remaining 50%
               of the students, the majority (36.2%) find it easier to make friends with people of
               the opposite sex, and the remainder (13.7%) find it easier to make friends with
               people of their own sex.</p>
