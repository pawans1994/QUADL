         <p>Here are the number of hours that 15 students spend on the computer on a typical day:
            </p><p> 1 1 2 3 6 7 5 5 5 8 8 8 11 12 15</p>
         <p>The mode number of hours spent on the computer is: <input_ref input="A"/>

         <response input="A" name="1" match="one">
            <feedback>Incorrect. Remember, the mode(s) is the most frequently
               occurring score.</feedback>

         <response input="A" name="5" match="two">
            <feedback>Incorrect. Remember, the mode is the most frequently occurring
               score; therefore, it is possible to have more than one mode in a distribution. Please
               try again.</feedback>

         <response input="A" name="5_and_8" match="four" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct. This sample has two modes, since 5 and 8 both occur 3 times in the
               sample and no other value occurs with more frequency.</feedback>

         <p>The data from the above 15 students forms a <input_ref input="B"/> distribution.

         <response input="B" name="unimodal" match="one">
            <feedback>Incorrect. To be a unimodal distribution, there would need to be only one
               mode. Since there is more than one mode, what type of distribution would it
               be?</feedback>

         <response input="B" name="bimodal" match="two" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct! There are two modes (5 and 8) in the distribution of scores;
               therefore, it is a bimodal distribution.</feedback>
         </response>
         <response input="B" name="multimodal" match="three">
            <feedback>Incorrect. While there is more than one mode in the distribution, multimodal
               distributions contain more than two modes. Since there are two modes, what type of
               distribution is it?</feedback>
