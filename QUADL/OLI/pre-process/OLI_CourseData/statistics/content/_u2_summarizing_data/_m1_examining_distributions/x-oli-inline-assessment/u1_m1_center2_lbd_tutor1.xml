      <body>
         <p>Remove all points by clicking on the trash. Place three observations on the line by
            clicking below it, two close together near the center of the line, and one somewhat to
            the right of those two. Pull the single right-most observation out to the right. (Place
            the cursor on the point, hold down the mouse button, and drag the point.) </p>
         <p>How does the mean behave?</p>
         <p>How does the median behave?</p>
         <p>Make sure you understand why each measure acts as it does.</p>

         <explanation>
            <p>As we move the single right-most observation out to the right, the mean also moves to
               the right, while the median stays in its place. By moving the point to the extreme
               right we are creating an outlier, and outliers affect the mean and not the median.
               The mean is affected because it's a numerical average of all the values. The median
               is affected only by the order of the observations (which has not changed). </p>
