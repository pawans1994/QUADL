<title>Learning Objectives&#8212;Examining Distributions</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
By the end of the section on examining distributions, you should be able
to:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Summarize and describe the distribution of a categorical variable
in context.</li>
<li>Generate and interpret several different graphical displays of the
distribution of a quantitative variable (histogram, stemplot,
boxplot). </li>
<li>Summarize and describe the distribution of a quantitative variable in context:
 <ul>
<li>Describe the overall pattern.</li>
<li>Describe striking deviations from the pattern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Understand concepts and measures of central location and spread, as
well as shape, so that you can:
 <ul>
<li>choose the appropriate measures of center and spread in different
    situations.</li>
<li>translate your understanding to support decision making. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apply the Standard Deviation Rule (as a means for interpreting the value of
  standard deviation) to the special case of distributions having the
"normal" shape.
</li>
<li>Compare and contrast distributions (of quantitative data) from two or more groups, and produce a
    brief summary, interpreting your findings in context.</li>
</ol>
