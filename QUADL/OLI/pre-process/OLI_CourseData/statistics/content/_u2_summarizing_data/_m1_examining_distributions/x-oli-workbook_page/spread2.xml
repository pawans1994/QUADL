<title>Inter-Quartile Range (IQR)</title>
<body>
<p>While the range quantifies the variability by looking at the range covered by <em style="italic"
                  >ALL</em> the data, the IQR measures the variability of a distribution by giving
               us the range covered by the <em style="italic">MIDDLE 50%</em> of the data. </p>
<p>The following picture illustrates this idea: (Think about the horizontal line as the data ranging from the min to the Max).
</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/spread2.gif" alt="A horizontal line representing all of the data.
The entire line represents the range of the data, and the leftmost point is the minimum data point. The rightmost
point is the maximum data point. 25% of the range spanning the area between the leftmost point and 1/4 of the line
from the leftmost point is labeled the Bottom 25% of the data. The area from the 1/4 point to the 3/4 point is
labeled the middle 50% of the data. This is where the IQR is calculated. Indeed, the middle 50% represents half
of the line. The rest of the line, the remaining 1/4 from the 3/4 point to the rightmost point, is the top 25% of
the data."/>
<p>
Here is how the IQR is actually found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arrange the data in increasing order, and find the median M. Recall that the median divides the
                  data, so that 50% of the data points are below the median, and 50% of the data
                  points are above the median. <image style="block" src="../webcontent/spread3.gif"
                  alt="A line representing the range of the data. Once again, the leftmost point is the minimum,
and the rightmost point is the maximum. At the middle is M, the median. All of the line to the left of M is the
bottom 50% of the data, and all of the line to the right of M is the top 50% of the data."/>
               </li>
<li>Find the median of the lower 50% of the data. This is called the first quartile of the
                  distribution, and the point is denoted by Q1. Note from the picture that Q1
                  divides the lower 50% of the data into two halves, containing 25% of the data
                  points in each half. Q1 is called the first quartile, since one quarter of the
                  data points fall below it. <image style="block" src="../webcontent/spread4.gif"
                  alt="The same line as the image above, except the bottom 50% has been split in half
at the median of all of the data in the bottom 50%. This median is Q1. To the left of Q1 is 25% of 
the data. This is between the minimum point and Q1. On the other side of Q1 is another 25% of the data.
This is from Q1 to M. Together these two 25% sections make up the bottom 50% of the data. To the
right of M is the top 50% of the data, so in total, to the right of Q1 is 25% of the data and the top
50% of the data, for a total of 75% of the data."/>
               </li>
<li>Repeat this again for the top 50% of the data. Find the median of the top 50% of the data. This
                  point is called the third quartile of the distribution, and is denoted by Q3. Note
                  from the picture that Q3 divides the top 50% of the data into two halves, with 25%
                  of the data points in each. Q3 is called the third quartile, since three quarters
                  of the data points fall below it. <image style="block"
                     src="../webcontent/spread5.gif" alt="The same line as the image above, except
the top 50% has been split in half at the median of all of the data in the top 50%. This median is Q3.
To the left of Q3 is 25% of the data. This is between M and Q3. On the other side of Q3 is another 25%
of the data. This is from Q3 to the maximum point. Together these two 25% sections make up the top 50%
of the data. To the left of M is the top 50% of the data, so in total, to the left of Q3 is 25% of the
data and the bottom 50% of the data, for a total of 75% of the data."/>
               </li>
<li> The middle 50% of the data falls between Q1 and Q3, and therefore:

<p>IQR = Q3 - Q1 </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/spread6.gif" alt="A line representing the range of data. The
leftmost point is the minimum point and the rightmost point is the maximum point. 25% of the line
starting at the minimum point is the area to the left of Q1. To the right of Q1, going right another
25% of the line brings us to M. Going right another 25% brings us to Q3, and the last 25% brings us to
the maximum point. The line segment between Q1 and Q3 is the middle 50% of the data, which is used for
to calculate IQR = Q3-Q1"/>

<p>The last picture shows that Q1, M, and Q3 divide the data into four quarters with 25% of the data
                     points in each, where the median is essentially the second quartile. The use of
                     IQR = Q3 - Q1 as a measure of spread is therefore particularly appropriate when the
                     median M is used as a measure of center.</p>

<p>We can define a bit more precisely what is considered the bottom or top 50% of the data. The
                     bottom (top) 50% of the data is all the observations whose position in the
                     ordered list is to the left (right) of the location of the overall median M.
                     The following picture will visually illustrate this for the simple cases of n = 7
                     and n = 8.</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/spread7.gif" alt="Two sets of dots. The first set of dots
consists of 7 dots. These dots represent data points, and they are ordered so that the dots are in a
line, from least to greatest. The 4th dot is the middle dot, so this is the median. The bottom 50%
of the data are the 3 dots to the left of the 4th dot, and the top 50% of the data are the 3 dots to
the right of the 4th dot. In the second set of dots, we have 8 dots, arranged from least to greatest.
There is no middle dot, so the median M is the average of the 4th and 5th dots. The 4 dots from the 1st
to 4th dot are the bottom 50% of the data, and the four dots from the 5th to 8th are the top 50% of the
data."/>
<p>Note that when n is odd (as in n = 7 above), the median is <em>not</em> included in either the
                     bottom or top half of the data; When n is even (as in n = 8 above), the data are
                     naturally divided into two halves.</p>
