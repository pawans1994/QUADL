         <p>The Current Population Survey conducted by the Census Bureau records the incomes of a
               large sample of U.S. households each month. What will be the relationship between
               the mean and median of the collected data?</p>

      <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
         <choice value="Res1">The mean will be bigger than the median.</choice>
         <choice value="Res2">The mean will be smaller than the median.</choice>
         <choice value="Res3">The mean and the median will be about the same.</choice>

         <response match="Res1" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct. The distribution of incomes is skewed right, so the mean will be
                  bigger than the median.</feedback>

         <response match="Res2" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. The mean is smaller than the median when the distribution is skewed <em style="italic">left</em>. Recall that the distribution of incomes is skewed right.</feedback>

         <response match="Res3" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. The mean and the median will be about the same when the distribution is <em style="italic">symmetric</em>. Recall that the distribution of incomes is skewed right.</feedback>
         </response>
         <hint>Recall that datasets of incomes typically have a distribution that is skewed
               right.</hint>
