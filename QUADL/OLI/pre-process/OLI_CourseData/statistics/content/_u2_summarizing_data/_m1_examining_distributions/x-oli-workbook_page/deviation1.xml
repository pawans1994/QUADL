            <title>Introduction</title>
            <body>
                <p>So far, we have introduced two measures of spread; the range (covered by all the
                    data) and the inter-quartile range (IQR), which looks at the range covered by
                    the middle 50% of the distribution. We also noted that the IQR should be paired
                    as a measure of spread with the median as a measure of center. We now move on to
                    another measure of spread, the <em>standard deviation</em>, which quantifies the
                    spread of a distribution in a completely different way.</p>

            <title>Idea</title>
            <body>
                <p>The idea behind the standard deviation is to quantify the spread of a
                    distribution by measuring how far the observations are from their mean, <m:math

                    between a data point and the mean, <m:math overflow="scroll">

            <title>Notation</title>
            <body>
                <p>There are many notations for the standard deviation: SD, s, Sd, StDev. Here,
                    we'll use <em>SD</em> as an abbreviation for standard deviation, and use
                        <em>s</em> as the symbol.</p>

            <title>Calculation</title>
            <body>
                <p>In order to get a better understanding of the standard deviation, it would be
                    useful to see an example of how it is calculated. In practice, we will use a
                    computer to do the calculation.</p>
                <example>
                    <title>Video Store Customers</title>
                    <p>The following are the number of customers who entered a video store in 8
                        consecutive hours:

                                <li>Why do we take the square root? Note that 16 is an average of
                                    the squared deviations, and therefore has different units of
                                    measurement. In this case 16 is measured in "squared customers,"
                                    which obviously cannot be interpreted. We therefore take the
                                    square root in order to compensate for the fact that we squared
                                    our deviations, and in order to go back to the original unit of
                                    measurement.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Recall that the average number of customers who enter the store in an
                                hour is 9. The interpretation of SD = 4 is that on average, the
                                actual number of customers that enter the store each hour is 4 away
                                from 9.</p>

            <title>Properties of the Standard Deviation</title>
            <body>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>It should be clear from the discussion thus far that the SD should be
                            paired as a measure of spread with the mean as a measure of
                        center.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Note that the only way, mathematically, in which the SD = 0, is when all
                            the observations have the same value (Ex: 5, 5, 5, ... , 5), in which
                            case, the deviations from the mean (which is also 5) are all 0. This is
                            intuitive, since if all the data points have the same value, we have no
                            variability (spread) in the data, and expect the measure of spread (like
                            the SD) to be 0. Indeed, in this case, not only is the SD equal to 0,
                            but the range and the IQR are also equal to 0. Do you understand
                            why?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Like the mean, the SD is strongly influenced by outliers in the data.
                            Consider the example concerning video store customers: 3, 5, 7, 9, 9,
                            11, 13, 15 (data ordered). If the largest observation was wrongly
                            recorded as 150, then the average would jump up to <m:math

                            </m:math>, and the standard deviation would jump up to SD = 50.3. Note
                            that in this simple example, it is easy to see that while the standard
                            deviation is strongly influenced by outliers, the IQR is not. The IQR
                            would be the same in both cases, since, like the median, the calculation
                            of the quartiles depends only on the order of the data rather than the
                            actual values.</p></li>
