      <body>
         <p>The SAT Math scores of 1,000 future engineers and physicists are recorded. What will be
               the relationship between the mean and median of the collected data?</p>

      <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
         <choice value="Res1">The mean will be bigger than the median.</choice>
         <choice value="Res2">The mean will be smaller than the median.</choice>
         <choice value="Res3">The mean and median will be about the same.</choice>

            <feedback>Incorrect. The mean is smaller than the median when the distribution is skewed <em style="italic">right</em>. The SAT Math scores for these students will be mostly high scores, so the distribution will be skewed to the left.<!--Which type of distribution would best represent these scores?--></feedback>

         <response match="Res2" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct. Since the SAT Math scores for these students will be mostly high
                  scores, the distribution will be skewed to the left. Thus, the few low scores
                  (outliers) will make the mean smaller than the median.</feedback>
         </response>
         <response match="Res3" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. The mean and the median will be about the same when the distribution is <em style="italic">symmetric</em>. The SAT Math scores for these students will be mostly high scores, so the distribution will be skewed to the left.<!--Which type of distribution would best represent these scores?--></feedback>
         </response>
         <hint>Think about the shape of the distribution. Is it skewed right, skewed left, or
               symmetric?</hint>
