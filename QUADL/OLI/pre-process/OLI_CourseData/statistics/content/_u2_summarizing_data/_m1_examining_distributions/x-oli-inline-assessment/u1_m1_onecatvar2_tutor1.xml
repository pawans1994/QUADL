            <feedback>Incorrect. The two bar charts represent the distribution of the <em style="italic">same</em>
               variable. Both represent the variable that records the responses about body image
               (about right, overweight, underweight) for a sample of students.</feedback>

         <response match="Res3" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct. The two bar charts are different because counts and percentages have
               different scales on the vertical axis. Counts have a scale from 0 to the total number
               of subjects, while percentages always have a scale from 0 to 100.</feedback>
