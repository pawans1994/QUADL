         <response match="Res4" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct. Most children start to walk at about the same age, so the
               distribution is centered at about 18 months. It has some variability, but is unlikely
               to have outliers. Thus, it is symmetric and unimodal.</feedback>

            <feedback>Incorrect. Most children start to walk at about the same age.
               There is some variability, but it is unlikely that the distribution would have two
