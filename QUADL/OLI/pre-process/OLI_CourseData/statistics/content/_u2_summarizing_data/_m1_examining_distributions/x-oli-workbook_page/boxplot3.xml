         <title>Side-By-Side (Comparative) Boxplots</title>
         <body>
            <p>As we learned in the beginning of this module, the distribution of a quantitative
               variable is best represented graphically by a histogram. Boxplots are most useful
               when presented side-by-side for comparing and contrasting distributions from two or
               more groups. </p>

         <title>Best Actor/Actress Oscar Winners</title>
         <p>So far we have examined the age distributions of Oscar winners for males and females
            separately.</p>
         <p>It will be interesting to <em style="italic">compare</em> the age distributions of
            actors and actresses who won best acting Oscars. To do that we will look at side-by-side
            boxplots of the age distributions by gender. <!-- <image style="block"

            Best Actor dataset, we used statistical software, and here are the results we got: </p>

               <p>Based on the graph and numerical measures, we can make the following comparison
                  between the two distributions: </p>
               <p>
                  <em>Center:</em> The graph reveals that the age distribution of the males is
                  higher than the females' age distribution. This is supported by the numerical
                  measures. The median age for females (34.5) is lower than for the males (43.5).
                  Actually, it should be noted that even the third quartile of the females'
                  distribution (42) is lower than the median age for males. We therefore conclude
                  that in general, actresses win the Best Actress Oscar at a younger age than actors
                  do.</p>
               <p>
                  <em>Spread:</em> Judging by the range of the data, there is much more variability
                  in the females' distribution (range = 59) than there is in the males' distribution
                  (range = 47). On the other hand, if we look at the IQR, which measures the
                  variability only among the middle 50% of the distribution, we see slightly more
                  spread in the ages of males (IQR = 12.5) than females (IQR = 11.5). We conclude
                  that among all the winners, the actors' ages are more alike than the actresses'
                  ages. However, the middle 50% of the age distribution of actresses is more
                  homogeneous than the actors' age distribution.</p>
               <p>
                  <em>Outliers:</em> We see that we have outliers in both distributions. There is
                  only one high outlier in the actors' distribution (76, Henry Fonda, <em
                     style="italic">On Golden Pond</em>), compared with three high outliers in the
                  actresses' distribution. </p>

         <p>When looking at the graph, the similarities and differences between the two
            distributions are striking. Both distributions have roughly the same center (medians are
            61.4 for Pitt, and 62.7 for San Francisco). However, the temperatures in Pittsburgh have
            a much larger variability than the temperatures in San Francisco (Range: 49 vs. 12. IQR:
            36.5 vs. 5). </p>
         <p>The practical interpretation of the results we got is that the weather in San Francisco
            is much more consistent than the weather in Pittsburgh, which varies a lot during the
            year. Also, because the temperatures in San Francisco vary so little during the year,
            knowing that the median temperature is around 63 is actually very informative. On the
            other hand, knowing that the median temperature in Pittsburgh is around 61 is
            practically useless, since temperatures vary so much during the year, and can get much
            warmer or much colder. </p>
         <p>Note that this example provides more intuition about variability by interpreting small
            variability as consistency, and large variability as lack of consistency. Also, through
            this example we learned that the center of the distribution is more meaningful as a
            typical value for the distribution when there is little variability (or, as
            statisticians say, little "noise") around it. When there is large variability, the
            center loses its practical meaning as a typical value. </p>

               <li>The five-number summary of a distribution consists of the median (M), the two
                  quartiles (Q1, Q3) and the extremes (min, Max).</li>
               <li>The five-number summary provides a complete numerical description of a
                  distribution. The median describes the center, and the extremes (which give the
                  range) and the quartiles (which give the IQR) describe the spread.</li>
               <li>The boxplot graphically represents the distribution of a quantitative variable by
                  visually displaying the five number summary and any observation that was
                  classified as a suspected outlier using the 1.5 (IQR) criterion. </li>
               <li>Boxplots are most useful when presented side-by-side to compare and contrast
                  distributions from two or more groups. </li>
