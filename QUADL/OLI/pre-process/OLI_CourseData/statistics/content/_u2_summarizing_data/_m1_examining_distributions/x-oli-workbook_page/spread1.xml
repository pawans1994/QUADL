            <body>
                <p>So far we have learned about different ways to quantify the center of a
                    distribution. A measure of center by itself is not enough, though, to describe a
                    distribution. Consider the following two distributions of exam scores. Both
                    distributions are centered at 70 (the median of both distributions is
                    approximately 70), but the distributions are quite different. The first
                    distribution has a much larger variability in scores compared to the second
                    one.</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/spread1.gif"
                    alt="Two dot plots of exam scores. The first plot
has a median of approximately 70, but there are scores from below 50 to above 90. In the second dot plot,
the median is once again about 70, but this time the range of scores is from about 60 to about 80."/>
                <p>In order to describe the distribution, we therefore need to supplement the
                    graphical display not only with a measure of center, but also with a measure of
                    the variability (or spread) of the distribution.</p>
                <p>In this section, we will discuss the three most commonly used measures of spread: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Range</li>
                    <li>Inter-quartile range (IQR)</li>
                    <li>Standard deviation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Like the different measures of center, these measures provide different ways to
                    quantify the variability of the distribution.</p>

        <section>
            <title>Range</title>
            <body>
                <p>The <em>range</em> covered by the data is the most intuitive measure of
                    variability. The range is exactly the distance between the smallest data point
                    (min) and the largest one (Max).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Range = Max - min</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Note: When we first looked at the histogram, and tried to get a first feel for
                    the spread of the data, we were actually <em style="italic">approximating</em>
                    the range, rather than calculating the exact range.</p>
                <example>
                    <title>Best Actress Oscar Winners</title>
                    <p>We will continue with the Best Actress Oscar winners example (To see the full
                        dataset, <activity_link idref="bestactressdataset_2013" target="new">click
                            here</activity_link>.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <formula style="block">34 34 27 37 42 41 36 32 41 33 31 74 33 49 38 61 21 41
                            26 80 42 29 33 36 45 49 39 34 26 25 33 35 35 28 30 29 61 32 33 45 29 62
                            22 44</formula>
                    </p>
                    <p>In this example: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>min = 21 (Marlee Matlin for <em style="italic">Children of a Lesser
                                God</em>, 1986)</li>
                        <li>Max = 80 (Jessica Tandy for <em style="italic">Driving Miss Daisy</em>,
                            1989)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The range covered by all the data is 80 - 21 = 59 years.</p>
