            <p>If I had to choose one college based on the graduation rates, I would choose college
               D. Not only does this college have the largest median graduation rates, but it also
               has the smallest variation in graduation rates over the years. This means that even
               in years when college D has a relatively small graduation rate, it is not

               smaller than the median (min = 74.1%, Median = 79%), and is still higher than most
               graduation rates at the other colleges. In particular, the smallest graduation rate
               that occurred in college D (74.1%), is still higher than: </p>
            <p>&#8226; the highest graduation rate at colleges A and E, </p>
            <p>&#8226; the third quartile of the distribution of graduation rates at colleges B and
               C, and </p>
            <p>&#8226; the median graduation rate at college F.</p>
