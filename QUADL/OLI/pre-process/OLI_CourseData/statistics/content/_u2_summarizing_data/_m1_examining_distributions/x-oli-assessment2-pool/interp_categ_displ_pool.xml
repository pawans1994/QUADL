            <p>A student survey was conducted at a major university, and data were collected from a
                random sample of 750 undergraduate students. One variable that was recorded for each
                student was the student's answer to the question "With whom do you find it easiest
                to make friends? Opposite sex/same sex/no difference." </p>
