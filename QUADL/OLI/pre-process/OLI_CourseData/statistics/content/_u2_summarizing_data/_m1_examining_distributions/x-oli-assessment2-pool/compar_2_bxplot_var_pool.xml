                <feedback>Correct. The city whose boxplot appears "longer" is the city whose incomes
                    had more variability. In this case, Statstown has more variability, since we see
                    the Statstown boxplot extends more on either side than the Medianville plot.

                    incomes had more variability.

                    cities by comparing the side-to-side extent of the two boxplots. The city whose
                    boxplot shows more overall length is the city with more income variation.
