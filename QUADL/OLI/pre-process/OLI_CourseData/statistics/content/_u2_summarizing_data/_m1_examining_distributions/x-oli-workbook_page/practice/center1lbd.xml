                        <p>A study was done in order to find out whether pamphlets containing
                            information for cancer patients are written at a level that the cancer
                            patients can understand. Tests were administered to measure the reading
                            levels of 63 cancer patients, and the readability levels of 30 cancer
                            pamphlets were evaluated based on such factors as the lengths of the
                            sentences and the number of polysyllabic words. Both the reading and
                            readability levels correspond to grade levels, but patients' reading
                            levels of less than grade 3 and above grade 12 cannot be determined
                            exactly. (<em>Source</em>: Short, Moriarty, and Cooly. (1995).

                        <p>The following tables indicate the number of patients at each reading
                            level and the number of pamphlets at each readability level. </p>

                        <p>Note: For both the reading level and readability level, the data are
                            presented in a grouped form where the count represents the frequency of
                            occurrence of that level. In the readability data, for example, the
                            count of level 6 is 3 which means that the first three data points are 6
                            6 6; the count of level 7 is 3 which means that the next three data
                            points are 7 7 7; the count of level 8 is 8 which means that the next
                            eight data points are 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8, and so on. </p>
