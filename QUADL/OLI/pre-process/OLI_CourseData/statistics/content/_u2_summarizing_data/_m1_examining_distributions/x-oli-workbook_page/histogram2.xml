            <title>Interpreting the Histogram</title>
            <body>
                <p>Once the distribution has been displayed graphically, we can describe the overall
                    pattern of the distribution and mention any striking deviations from that
                    pattern. More specifically, we should consider the following features of the
                    distribution:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/histogram10.gif" alt="The overall pattern of
 the distribution can be described by the shape, center, and spread of the histogram. Outliers in the
 distribution are deviations from the pattern."/>
                <p>We will get a sense of the overall pattern of the data from the histogram's
                    center, spread and shape, while outliers will highlight deviations from that
                    pattern. </p>

            <title>Shape</title>
            <body>
                <p>When describing the shape of a distribution, we should consider:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Symmetry/skewness</em> of the distribution.</li>
                    <li><em>Peakedness (modality)</em>&#8212;the number of peaks (modes) the
                        distribution has.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We distinguish between:</p>

            <title>Symmetric Distributions</title>
            <body>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/histogram2.gif" alt="A symmetric, Single-peaked
(Unimodal) distribution. The histogram's bars start at low values close to 0 on the left and rise to a
peak where the x-axis is labeled 10. Then, the values decrease as we go right, back down to nearly 0."/>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/histogram3.gif" alt="A symmetric, Double-peaked
(Bimodal) distribution. The histogram's bars start at low values close to 0 on the left and rise to the
first peak where the x-axis is labeled 10. Then, the values decrease as we go right, back down to nearly 0
at roughly where x=15. The values increase again and peak at x=20, and then, continuing right, decrease
to nearly 0."/>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/histogram4.gif" alt="A symmetric, Uniform
distribution. Throughout the entire range of the x-axis the bars are roughly the same height, meaning
they are the same value."/>
                <p>Note that all three distributions are symmetric, but are different in their
                    modality (peakedness). The first distribution is <em>unimodal</em>&#8212;it has
                    one mode (roughly at 10) around which the observations are concentrated. The
                    second distribution is <em>bimodal</em>&#8212;it has two modes (roughly at 10
                    and 20) around which the observations are concentrated. The third distribution
                    is kind of flat, or <em>uniform</em>. The distribution has no modes, or no value
                    around which the observations are concentrated. Rather, we see that the
                    observations are roughly uniformly distributed among the different values.</p>

            <title>Skewed Right Distributions</title>
            <body>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/histogram5.gif" alt="A Skewed-right histogram. As
we proceed from left to right across the x-axis, the bars rapidly increase to the peak of the histogram,
located at roughly x=33. From there, the values slowly decrease, and the last measurement is at x=200.
The bars of the histogram are barely visible above the x-axis starting at about x=150."/>
                <p>A distribution is called <em>skewed right</em> if, as in the histogram above, the
                    right tail (larger values) is much longer than the left tail (small values).
                    Note that in a skewed right distribution, the bulk of the observations are
                    small/medium, with a few observations that are much larger than the rest. An
                    example of a real-life variable that has a skewed right distribution is salary.
                    Most people earn in the low/medium range of salaries, with a few exceptions
                    (CEOs, professional athletes etc.) that are distributed along a large range
                    (long "tail") of higher values.</p>

            <title>Skewed Left Distributions</title>

                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/histogram6.gif" alt="A Skewed-Left histogram. As
we proceed from left to right across the x-axis, the bars rapidly slowly to the peak of the histogram,
located at roughly x=78. From there, the values rapidly decrease, and the last measurement is at x=90.
Since the X-axis starts at 0, the peak is offset to the right of the center of the histogram." />
                <p>A distribution is called <em>skewed left</em> if, as in the histogram above, the
                    left tail (smaller values) is much longer than the right tail (larger values).
                    Note that in a skewed left distribution, the bulk of the observations are
                    medium/large, with a few observations that are much smaller than the rest. An
                    example of a real life variable that has a skewed left distribution is age of
                    death from natural causes (heart disease, cancer etc.). Most such deaths happen
                    at older ages, with fewer cases happening at younger ages. </p>

                    <li><p>Note that skewed distributions can also be bimodal. Here is an example. A
                            medium size neighborhood 24-hour convenience store collected data from
                            537 customers on the amount of money spend in a single visit to the
                            store. The following histogram displays the data. </p><p><image
                                style="block" src="../webcontent/bimode_hist.png" alt="A histogram in which
the Y-axis is labeled with units in Frequency, from 0 to 70. The X-axis is labeled in Dollars Spent, from
0 to 105. Going from left to right on the X-axis, the bars of the histogram increase to a peak at x=25, where
y=70. Then, the bars decrease, but at x=45 they begin to increase again, reaching a second peak
at x=50, where y=37. Then, the values decrease until the end of the histogram."/></p><p>Note that
                            the overall shape of the distribution is skewed to the right with a
                            clear mode around $25. In addition it has another (smaller) “peak”
                            (mode) around $50-55. The majority of the customers spend around $25 but
                            there is a cluster of customers who enter the store and spend around $50-55.
                        </p></li>
                    <li>If a distribution has more than two modes, we say that the distribution is
                            <em style="bold">multimodal</em>. </li>


                </ol>
                <p>Recall our grades example:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/histogram1.gif" alt="The exam grades histogram
from earlier."/>
                <p> As you can see from the histogram, the grades distribution is roughly symmetric.
