        <title>Examining Distributions</title>
        <!--
    <objectives>
<p>Recall "The Big Picture," the three step process that encompasses statistics (as it is presented in this course):</p>
<ol>
<li>Producing data - choosing a sample from the population of interest and collecting data</li>
<li>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - summarizing the data we've collected</li>
<li>Inference - drawing conclusions from the sample back to the entire population.</li>
</ol>

<p>We are currently working on the second step in this process, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</p>
<p>By the end of this module, students should be able to:</p>

<p>As indicated in the introduction, we will begin the EDA part of the course by exploring
(or looking at) one variable at a time.</p>
<p> As we saw in the <activity_link idref="eda_intro" target="self">Introduction to Exploratory Data
                Analysis</activity_link>, the data for each variable are a long list of values
            (whether numerical or not), and are not very informative in that form. In order to
            convert these raw data into useful information we need to summarize and then examine the
                <em>distribution</em> of the variable. By <em>distribution</em> of a variable, we
            mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>what values the variable takes, and </li>
<li>how often the variable takes those values.</li>
</ul>
<p>This module has two sections.  We will first learn how to summarize and examine the distribution of a single categorical variable, and then
do the same for a quantitative variable.
