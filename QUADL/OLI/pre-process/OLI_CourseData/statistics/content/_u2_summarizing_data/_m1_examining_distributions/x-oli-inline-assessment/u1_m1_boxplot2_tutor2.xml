               remember that 25% of the data fall below Q1 (11), 25% of the data fall between Q1
               (11) and M (14), 25% of the data fall between M (14) and Q3 (20), and 25% of the data

            <feedback>Correct. Note that 10 is below Q1, and 15 is above the M, so we expect more
               than 25% of the shows to have ratings in that interval. Using a similar reasoning, in
               all the other intervals we would expect to see LESS than 25% of the shows.</feedback>
