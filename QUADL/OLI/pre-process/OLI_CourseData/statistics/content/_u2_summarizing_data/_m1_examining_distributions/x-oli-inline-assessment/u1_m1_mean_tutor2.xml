                <p>A recent survey asked 90 students, How many hours do you spend on the computer in a typical day?</p>

                <p>What is the average (mean) number of hours spent on the computer?</p>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. It seems you are adding the numbers 1,2,…,9 and then dividing by 90. While it is true that the average is obtained by dividing by 90, you did not take into account the frequency of each of the values.

                    <feedback>Incorrect. 4 is the mode of the distribution—the value that occurs with the highest frequency but not the mean in this case.<!--It seems you are adding the numbers 1,2,…,9 and then dividing by 90.

                    <feedback>Correct. The average is found as follows: 
[3(1) + 5(2) + 15(3) + 25(4) + 20(5) + 15(6) + 5(7) + 1(8) + 1(9)]/90 = 4.44</feedback>
