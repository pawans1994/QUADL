						<feedback>Incorrect. Notice the distribution is skewed (it
							has a ‘tail’ towards one side) and it also has a suspected outlier (the
							value at 90). Remember that when a distribution is skewed or has
							outliers, the median is the most appropriate measure of center, and the
							IQR is the most appropriate measure of spread. Using a measure of center
							other than the median, or using a measure of spread other than the IQR,
							would give misleading results for this distribution. (D) is the correct

                <feedback>Correct. Since the mean is larger than the median, we can infer that there
                    are more extreme ages on the right, pulling the mean up. This is why we know the
                    distribution is skewed right.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. In a symmetric distribution the mean and the median will be
                    equal. Since 37 and 42 are quite different, the distribution will not be
                    symmetric. Recall that the mean is more affected by extreme values than the
