      <body>
         <p>Use the applet to convince yourself that when you add another observation to those
            already in place from the last exercise (there will now be 7 in total), the median does
            not change, regardless of where you put the 7th point. Do you understand why this is the
            case?</p>

            <p>When we had six points, our median was the average of the two central points, which
               were equal in our case. Once we added one more point (now a total of 7 points), the
               median stays the same, because one of the two central points from the original
               dataset  will now be among the upper half of the points or the lower half, depending
               on where you put the new point, but the other one remains as the "center"
               observation, i.e., the median. </p>
