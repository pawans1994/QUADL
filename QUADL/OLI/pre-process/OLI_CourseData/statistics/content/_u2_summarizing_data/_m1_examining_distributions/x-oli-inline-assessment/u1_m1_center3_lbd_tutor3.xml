            <!--LO:Determine the relationship between a median and mean for a histogram-->
            <body>Using this same histogram of 105 patients, which of the following is most likely to be true? </body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="false" select="single">
                <choice value="A">The mean will be larger than the median.</choice>
                <choice value="B">The median will be larger than the mean.</choice>
                <choice value="C">The mean and median will be about the same.</choice>

                <response match="A" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. Since the distribution is skewed right, the mean will be
                        larger than the median.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. The mean is influenced by outliers. Since there are outliers in the right-hand part of the distribution, the mean will be pulled toward that end of the distribution.<!--Remember, the mean is influenced by outliers. Since there
                        are outliers in the right hand part of the distribution, the mean is larger
                        than the median.--></feedback>

                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Remember, the mean is influenced by outliers. Since there
                        are outliers in the right-hand part of the distribution, the mean and median
                        will not be equal.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. There is enough information to determine the relationship
                        between the mean and median.</feedback>
                </response>-->
                <hint>You are trying to figure out the relationship between the median and the
                    mean.</hint>
                <hint>Look at the shape of the distribution and note any possible outliers. How
                    might outliers affect the median and mean?</hint>
                <hint>Since there are 105 patients and two outliers (in the 500 to 540 range), we
                    know that the distribution is skewed right. What is the relationship between the
                    mean and median in a skewed-right distribution?</hint>
