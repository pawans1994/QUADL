<ol>
<li>The central box spans from Q1 to Q3. In our example, the box spans from 32 to 41.5. Note that
                                                  the width of the box has no meaning. <image
                                                  style="block" src="../../webcontent/boxplot1.gif"
                                                  />
                                                  </li>
<li>A line in the box marks the median M, which in our case is 35. <image style="block"
                                                  src="../../webcontent/boxplot2.gif"/>
                                                  </li>
<li>Lines extend from the edges of the box to the smallest and largest observations that were not
                                                  classified as suspected outliers (using the
                                                  1.5xIQR criterion). In our example, we have no low
                                                  outliers, so the bottom line goes down to the
                                                  smallest observation, which is 21. Since we have
                                                  three high outliers (61,74, and 80), the top line
                                                  extends only up to 49, which is the largest
                                                  observation that has not been flagged as an
                                                  outlier. <image style="block"
                                                  src="../../webcontent/boxplot3.gif"/>
                                                  </li>
<li>outliers are marked with asterisks (*). <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/boxplot4.gif"
                                                  />
                                                  </li>
</ol>
<p>To summarize: the following information is visually depicted in the boxplot:</p>
<ul>
<li> the five number summary (blue)</li>
<li> the range and IQR (red)</li>
<li> outliers (green)</li>
</ul>
