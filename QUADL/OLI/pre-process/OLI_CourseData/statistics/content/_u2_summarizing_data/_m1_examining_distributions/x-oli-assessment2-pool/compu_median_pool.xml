                    represented by the total height of the four bars on the right side of the

                <feedback>Correct. The median is the middle value. There are 50 people in the data,
                    so the median must be the age between the 25th youngest person and the 26th
                    youngest person. These people will both be represented in the third bar from the
                    left on the display. Since that bar represents ages from 25 to 35, the median
                    could be any value between those ages.</feedback>

                <feedback>Correct. To locate the median you first need to list the values in order
                    and then locate the middle value. In this set of values, 7 is the middle most
                    number (1, 6, 6, 6, <em style="bold">7</em>, 8, 11, 12, 15).</feedback>
