                    that have the normal shape, approximately 68% of the observations will fall
                    within 1 standard deviations of the mean. In this case, the mean is 100, and the
                    standard deviation is 15, so 68% of people have IQ scores between 85 and 115.
                    Since a normal distribution is symmetric, this leaves 32%/2 = 16% of people with
                    scores greater than 115, which is much more than the required 0.15%.</feedback>

                <feedback>Correct. The standard deviation rule tells us that for distributions that
                    have the normal shape, approximately 99.7% of the observations will fall within
                    3 standard deviations of the mean. In this case the mean is 100, and the
                    standard deviation is 15; therefore, approximately 99.7% of the observations (IQ
                    scores) fall between 100 − 3 * 15 and 100 + 3 * 15 or between 55 and 145.
                    Approximately 100% − 99.7% = 0.3% of the observations fall outside this
                    interval. Since the normal shape is symmetric, approximately 0.15% of the
                    observations fall above 145.</feedback>
