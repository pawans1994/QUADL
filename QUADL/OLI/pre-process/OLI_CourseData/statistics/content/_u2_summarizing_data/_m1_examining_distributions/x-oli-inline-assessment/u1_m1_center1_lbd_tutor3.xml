            <p>The median readability level of the cancer pamphlets is M = 9. We have 30 readability
               level data points, and therefore the median will be the mean of the observations
               located at the (30 / 2) = 15th and (30 / 2) + 1 = 16th spots in the ordered list.
               Taking the counts into consideration, we find that both the 15th and 16th ranked
               observations are 9, and therefore the median is (9 + 9) / 2 = 9.</p>
