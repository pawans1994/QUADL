         <p>A survey taken in a large statistics class contained the question: "What's the fastest
            you have driven a car (in miles per hour)?" The five-number summary for the 87 males
            surveyed is: </p><p>min = 55, Q1 = 95, Median = 110, Q3 = 120, Max = 155 </p><p> Should the largest observation in this data set be classified as an outlier?</p>

            <feedback>Incorrect. The IQR in this case is 120 − 95  =  25. Applying the
               1.5(IQR) rule, we find: Q3 + 1.5(IQR) = 120 + 1.5(25) = 157.5, and therefore the
               largest observation, 155, should <em style="italic">not</em>
               be classified as an outlier. Note, however, that in this case: Q1 − 1.5(IQR) = 95 −
               1.5(25) = 57.5, and therefore the smallest observation, 55, should be classified as
               an outlier.</feedback>
