         <response match="Res1" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. This is the mode, or the most frequently occurring number. The median is the middle most number, (n + 1)/2, in an ordered list of values.</feedback>
         </response>
         <response match="Res2" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. It appears you averaged 6 and 7, the 4th and 5th observations in the ordered list of values. Recall that when the number of observations is odd (which is the case here), the median is the observation in the (n + 1)/2 spot in the ordered list.</feedback>
         </response>
         <response match="Res3" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct. After you order the data, since n = 9, the median is (9 + 1)/2
               = 5, or the 5th observation in the ordered list, which in this case is 7.</feedback>
