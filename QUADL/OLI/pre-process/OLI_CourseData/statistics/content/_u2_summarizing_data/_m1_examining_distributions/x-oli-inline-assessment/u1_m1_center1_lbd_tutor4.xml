            <p>Even though the medians of the reading and readability levels are the same, the
               pamphlets are not well matched to patients' reading levels. Note that
               <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101016T201615-0400"?>the
               <?oxy_insert_end?>pamphlets<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101016T201618-0400"?>'<?oxy_insert_end?>
               readability level starts at grade level 6, while there are 17 (6 + 4 + 4 + 3) cancer
               patients whose reading level is below that. These 17 cancer patients therefore do not
               have any pamphlets
               <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101016T201639-0400"?>that<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101016T201642-0400" content="which"?>
               they can fully comprehend.</p>
