      <body>
         <p>Assume that the average rating in each of the three classes is 5 (which should be
            visually reasonably clear from the histograms), and recall the interpretation of the SD
            as a "typical" or "average" distance between the data points and their mean. Judging
            from the table and the histograms, which class would have the largest standard
            deviation, and which one would have the smallest standard deviation? Explain your
            reasoning.</p>

            <p>In class I, almost all the ratings are 5, which is also the mean. The average
               distance between the observations and the mean, then, would be very small. In class
               II most of the observations are far from the mean (at 1 or 9). The average distance
               between the observations and the mean in this case would be larger. Class III is the
               case where some of the observations are close to the mean, and some are far, so the
               average distance between the observations and the mean would be somewhere in between
               class I and II. This observation would lead me to conclude that the standard
               deviation would be ranked (from smallest to largest): Class I, Class III, Class
               II.</p>
