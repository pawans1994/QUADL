   <question id="q1">
      <body>
         <p>If you were debating between colleges B and F only, which one would you choose based on
            this data? Explain your reasoning.</p>
      </body>
      <short_answer id="A"/>
      <part>
         <response input="A" match="*" score="1"/>
         <explanation>
            <p>While Colleges B and F have about the same median graduation rate (B: 70.15%, F:
               72%), there is a big difference in the variation. College F has a very large
               variation, and therefore a much less consistent gradation rate over the years (it can
               get as low as 57.7%). College B, on the other hand, has a much more consistent
               graduation rate (small variability), and in that sense, college B is less "risky."
               Since I am not a "risk taker," and since both colleges have approximately the same
               median graduation rate, my choice between the two would be college B.</p>
