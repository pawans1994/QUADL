                  <p>* When some of the stems hold a large number of leaves, we can split each stem
                        into two: one holding the leaves 0-4, and the other holding the leaves 5-9.
                        A statistical software package will often do the splitting for you, when
                        appropriate. </p>

                        <em>Note </em>that when rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, the stemplot
                        visually resembles a histogram:</p>

This is the same as the last stem plot given in the previous image, but rotated so that the stems
are at the bottom, with the leaves on top."/>
                  <p>This orientation makes the right-skewedness of the distribution clearly
                        visible.</p>

            <p>The stemplot has additional unique features:</p>
            <ul>
                  <li> It preserves the original data.</li>
                  <li> It sorts the data (which will become very useful in the next section).</li>

                        <p>There is another type of display that we can use to summarize a
                              quantitative variable graphically&#8212;the <em>dotplot</em>. The
                              dotplot, like the stemplot, shows each observation, but displays it
                              with a dot rather than with its actual value. Here is the dotplot for
                              the ages of Best Actress Oscar winners. </p>

place of that age on the number line."

                              Its principal virtues are:</p>
                        <ul>
                              <li>Easy and quick to construct for small, simple datasets.</li>
