      <body>
         <p>In the textbox below, describe the distribution of the ages of the Best Actor Oscar
            winners. Be sure to address shape, center, spread and outliers. When you are done,
            compare your answer to ours.</p>
      </body>

         <response input="A" match="*" score="1"/>
         <explanation>
            <p>Shape:  the distribution is skewed right.  This means that most actors receive the best acting Oscar at a relatively younger age (before age 48), and fewer at an older age.
		</p>	
<p>Center:  The distribution seems to be centered at around 42-43.  This means that about half the actors are 42 or younger when they receive the Oscar, and about half are older.
</p>			
<p>Spread: The age distribution ranges from about 30 to about 75. The entire dataset is covered,
               then, by a range of 45 years. It should be noted, though, that there is one high
               outlier at around age 75, and the rest of the data ranges only from 30 to 60. </p>			
<p>Outliers: As mentioned above, there is one high outlier at around age 75. </p>
