            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Even though the medians of the reading and readability levels are the same, the pamphlets are not well matched to patients' reading levels.  Note that pamphlets readability level starts at grade level 6, while there are 17 (6+4+4+3) cancer patients whose reading level is below that.  These 17 cancer patients therefore do not have any pamphlets which they can fully comprehend.</mattext></material>
