            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Once the outlier for the year 1896 is removed, the equation for the least squares regression line is: 
Time = 872 - 0.33 * Year.  
When the outlier is removed, the line "drops" a bit - the intercept is smaller and the slope is not as negative. Both of these results are quite reasonable since the original data was pulled upward toward the outlier.  Once this outlier is removed, the line drops.</mattext></material>
