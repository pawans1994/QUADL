            <mattext texttype="text/plain">While Colleges B and F have about the same median graduation rate (B: 70.15%, F: 72%), there is a big difference in the variation.  College F has a very large variation and therefore a much less consistent gradation rate over the years (it can get as low as 57.7%).  College B, on the other hand, has a much more consistent graduation rate (small variability), and in that sense college B is less "risky".  Since I am not a "risk taker"....and since both colleges have approximately the same median graduation rate, my choice between the two would be college B.</mattext></material>
