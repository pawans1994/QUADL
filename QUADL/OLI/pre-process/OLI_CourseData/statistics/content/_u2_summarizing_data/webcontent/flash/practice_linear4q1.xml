            <mattext texttype="text/plain">The correlation is r = 0.663.  The relation is moderately strong and positive.  The positive direction of the relationship means that, in general, animals that have a longer lifespan also have longer pregnancies.  The moderate strength of the relationship tells us that the data follows the linear form and that there is some considerable variation around that form.</mattext></material>
