            <mattext texttype="text/plain">The direction of the relationship is positive.  In context, this means that individuals who are taller are heavier.  The form of the relationship is curvilinear.  Weight seems to increase more and more rapidly with height as we consider taller individuals. We might say that the relationship is moderate in strength, because the points suggest, but do not closely follow, a curvilinear form.  There do not appear to be any outliers.</mattext></material>
