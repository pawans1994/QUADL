            <mattext texttype="text/plain">After removing the outlier, the correlation drops from .663 to .519.  The elephant is an outlier, however it is consistent with the linear form of the relationship between longevity and gestation period.  In this case, it would be most informative to report both correlations. </mattext></material>
