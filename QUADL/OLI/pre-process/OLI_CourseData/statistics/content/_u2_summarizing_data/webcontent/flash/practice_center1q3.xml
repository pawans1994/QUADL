            <mattext texttype="text/plain">The median readability level of cancer pamphlets is M=9.  We have 30 readability level data points, and therefore the median will be the mean of the observations located at the (30/2) = 15th and (30/2) + 1 =16th spots in the ordered list.   Taking the counts into consideration, we find that both the 15th and 16th ranked observations are 9, and therfore the median is (9+9)/2 = 9.</mattext></material>
