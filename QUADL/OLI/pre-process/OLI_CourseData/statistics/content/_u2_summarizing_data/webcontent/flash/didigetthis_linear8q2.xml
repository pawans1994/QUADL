            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Correct. The slope is the change we would expect in the response variable for an increase of 1 unit in the explanatory variable. A positive slope of 1.0 for the regression line means that every change of 1 unit in the explanatory variable leads us to expect a change of 1 unit in the response variable.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>
