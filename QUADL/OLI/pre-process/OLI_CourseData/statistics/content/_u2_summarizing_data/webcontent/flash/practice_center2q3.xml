            <mattext texttype="text/plain">When we had six points, our median was the average of the two central points that were equal in our case. Once we added one more point (now total of 7 points), the median stays the same because one of the two central points from (i) might go to the upper half or the lower half, depending where you put the new point, but the other one remains as the center observation, i.e., the median.  </mattext></material>
