        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect. Recall that the slope is the change we would expect in the response variable for every 1-unit increase (or decrease) in the explanatory variable. In this context, which variable is the explanatory variable, and which variable is the response variable?</mattext></material></itemfeedback>
    <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack1">
      <material>
        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Correct. The explanatory variable is bond rate. A negative slope of 491 means that for each one unit change in the explanatory variable, we would expect the response variable to change by 491 units. Since the slope is negative the changes are in the opposite directions. Thus, if the explanatory variable increases, the response variable decreases, and vice versa.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>
