            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Association does not imply causation.  We cannot conclude that light exposure in early childhood somehow causes myopia in older children.  The data is suggestive of a relationship, but we can't rule out the possibility that a lurking variable is associated with parents' use of light with their young children and the children's later myopia.</mattext></material>
