<mattext texttype="text/plain">Now remove all points by clicking on the trash.  Place three observations on the line by clicking below it, two close together near the center of the line, and one somewhat to the right of these two.  Pull the single right-most observation out to the right. (Place the cursor on the point, hold down a mouse button and drag the point.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  How does the mean behave?&lt;br&gt;  How does the median behave?&lt;br&gt;  Make sure you understand why  each measure acts as it does.</mattext></material>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">As we move the single right-most observation out to the right, the mean also moves to the right, while the median stays in its place. By moving the point to the extreme right we are, in sense, creating an outlier and outliers affect the mean and not the median. The mean is affected because it's a numerical average of all the values. The median is affected only by the order of the observations (which has not changed). </mattext></material>
