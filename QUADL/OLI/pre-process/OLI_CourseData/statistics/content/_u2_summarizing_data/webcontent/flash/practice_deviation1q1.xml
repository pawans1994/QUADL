<mattext texttype="text/plain">Assume that the average rating in each of the three classes is 5 (which should be visually reasonably clear from the histograms), and recall the interpretation of the SD as a "typical" or "average" distance between the data points and their mean.  Judging from the table and the histograms, which class would have the largest standard deviation, and which one will have the smallest standard deviation? Explain your reasoning.</mattext></material>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">In class I, almost all the ratings are 5, which is also the mean.  The average distance between the observations and the mean, then, would be very small.  In class II most of the observations are far from the mean (at 1 or 9). The average distance between the observations and the mean in this case would be larger.  Class III is the case where some of the observations are close to the mean, and some are far, so the average distance between the observations and the mean would be somewhere in between class I and II.  This observation would lead me to conclude that the standard deviation would be ranked (from smallest to largest): Class I, Class III, Class II.</mattext></material>
