Note that these might look a little different than the ones you generated depending on the version of Excel you are using, but the values should be the same.
Center: &lt;br&gt;Of the six colleges, college D has the highest median graduatation rate (M==79), followed by college F (M=72), B (M=70.15), C (M=67.65), A (M=63.75) and college E (M=59.15).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spread:&lt;br&gt;College B has the smallest variation in graduation rates over the years (range = 9.4%, IQR = 3.5%). College D's graduation rates are also pretty consistent over the years (range = 10.5%, IQR = 4.45%). A larger variation in graduation rates is found in college E and C, and the least consistency in graduation rates (i.e., largest variation)is found in colleges A (range: 30.6%, IQR: 19.55%) and college F (range: 29.7%, IQR:16.23%). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of the graduation rates distributions have outliers.</mattext></material>
