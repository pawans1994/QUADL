            <mattext texttype="text/plain">If I had to choose one college based on the graduation rates I would choose college D. Not only does this college have the largest median graduation rates, but it also has the smallest variation in graduation rates over the years. This means that even in years when college D has a relatively small graduation rate, it is not MUCH smaller than the median (min=74.1% Median 79%), and is still higher than most graduation rates in the other colleges. In particular, the smallest graduation rate that occurred in college D (74.1%), is still higher than &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* the highest graduation rate in colleges A and E, &lt;br&gt;* the third quartile of the distribution of colleges B and C, and &lt;br&gt;* the median graduation rate in college F</mattext></material>
