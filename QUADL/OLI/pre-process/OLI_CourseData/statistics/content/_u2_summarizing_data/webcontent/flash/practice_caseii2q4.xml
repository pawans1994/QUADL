<mattext texttype="text/plain">Compare the distribution of nearsightedness between those exposed to lamp light, a night light, or no light at all.  What do the conditional percentages derived from the data suggest about the relationship between early night-time exposure to light and later myopia?  Should parents worry about using nightlights and lamps with young children?

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Of the three groups of children, those who were exposed to no light at all were least likely to be nearsighted, with an incidence of &lt;b&gt;9.9%&lt;/b&gt;.  Those exposed to a nightlight were nearsighted 34.1% of the time, and those exposed to a lamp were nearsighted &lt;b&gt;54.7%&lt;/b&gt; of the time. Note that these percents show that children who slept with a lamp were about 5 times more likely to develop nearsightedness than the children who slept with no light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based upon this data alone, parents might discontinue using nightlights and lamps with young children, as their use seems to be associated with nearsightedness when the children grow up.  However, there is a strong argument against this conclusion, which will be presented in a later lesson.
