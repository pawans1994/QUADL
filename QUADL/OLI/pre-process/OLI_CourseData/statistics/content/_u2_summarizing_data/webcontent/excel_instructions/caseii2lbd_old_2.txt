<ul><li>Pick a cell underneath the two-way table, and type the same row and column labels in that we used for the two-way table.</li><li>Now select the cell under <code style="inline">No</code> and to the right of <code style="inline">lamp</code>.  In this cell, we want the percentage of children  who slept with a lamp and did not develop nearsightedness.  Thus, we want to divide the number of children who slept with a lamp and did not develop nearsightedness by the total number of children who slept with a lamp, and then multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage.  The specific cell references depend on where exactly you created your two-way table, but if D2 represents the number of children who slept with a lamp and did not develop nearsightedness, and F2 represents the total number of children who slept with a lamp, the formula would be <code style="inline">=(D2/F2)*100</code>.</li><li>Calculate the percentages for the other cells in the same manner.</li></ul>
