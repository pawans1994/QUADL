            <mattext texttype="text/plain">A lurking variable that can very likely explain the observed relationship in this case is the nearsightedness of the parents (one or both).  If the parents are nearsighted, then their child is more likely to be nearsighted due to genetic factors.  Also, nearsighted parents are more likely to leave more light near their sleeping children to make it easier to care for them at night.
