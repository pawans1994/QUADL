<mattext texttype="text/plain">Our regression associates years as an explanatory variable with times in the 1500 meter race.  Use the least squares regression line you found in question 2 to predict the 1500 meter time in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.  Comment on your prediction.</mattext></material>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">872 - 0.33 * 2008 = 209.36 seconds.  (If we didn't round the slope and intercept, the answer is 207.36 seconds to the nearest hundredths place.)  This is an extrapolation.  We cannot be sure that the linear dependence of winning times upon years holds past the range of the explanatory variable, which is the year 2000.  At some point, the linear dependence must no longer apply because it would predict impossible winning times.</mattext></material>
