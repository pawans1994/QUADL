<mattext texttype="text/plain">Consider how taking gender into account adds to our understanding of the overall form of the relationship.  Address any interesting differences between the clusters associated with the two genders. More specifically, address the following two questions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(i) Where do the males and females fall on the scatterplot with respect to height and weight. Explain why you think this is so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(ii) Does it look like the weight of females increases with an increase in height as quickly as the weight of males increases with a corresponding increase in height?</mattext></material>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">We see that the overall form of the relationship can be thought of in terms of two clusters, one for each gender. Points corresponding to the females cluster in the lower left of the scatterplot, which means that females generally have a lower height and weight (due to obvious biological differences between males and females). The main difference between males and females is that the weight of females does not appear to increase as quickly with height as the weight of males does.</mattext></material>
