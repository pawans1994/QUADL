This means that most actors receive the best acting Oscar at a relatively younger age (before age 48), and fewer at an older age.			Center:  The distribution seems to be centered at around 42-43.  This means that about half the actors are 42 or younger when they receive the Oscar, and about half are older.			Spread:  The age distribution ranges from about 30 to 75.  The entire data is covered, then, by a range of 45 years.  It should be noted though, that there is one high outlier at around age 75, and the rest of the data ranges only from 30 to 60.			Outliers:  As mentioned above, there is one high outlier at age 75.			</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
