            <title>Case C→C: Two Categorical Variables</title>
            <body>
                <p>Recall the role-type classification table for framing our discussion about the
                    relationship between two variables: </p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/caseii1.gif" alt="It is possible
for any type of explanatory variable to be paired with any type of response variable.
The possible pairings are:
Categorical Explanatory → Categorical Response (C→C),
Categorical Explanatory → Quantitative Response (C→Q), which we have already covered,
Quantitative Explanatory → Categorical Response (Q→C), and
Quantitative Explanatory → Quantitative Response (Q→Q). In this section we will be working on C→C"/>
                <p>We are done with case C→Q, and
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T133321-0400"?>will now
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>move on to case C→C, where we examine the relationship between
                    two categorical variables.</p>
                <p>Earlier in the course, (when we discussed the distribution of a <em>single</em>
                    categorical variable) we examined the data obtained when a random sample of
                    1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145034-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>200
                    U.S. college students were asked about their body<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145041-0400"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145040-0400" content="-"?>image
                    (underweight, overweight, or about right.) We are now returning to this example,
                    to address the following question:</p>
                <p>If we had separated our sample of
                    1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145051-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>200
                    U.S. college students by gender and looked at <em>males and females
                        separately</em>, would we have found a similar distribution across
                    body-image categories? More specifically, are men and women just as likely to
                    think their weight is about right? Among those students who do not think their
                    weight is about right, is there a difference between the genders in feelings
                    about body<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145111-0400"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145115-0400" content="-"?>image?</p>
                <p>Answering these questions requires us to <em>examine the relationship between two
                        categorical variables</em>,
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145130-0400"?>g<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145130-0400" content="G"?>ender
                    and <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145133-0400"?>b<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145132-0400" content="B"?>ody<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145134-0400"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145134-0400" content="-"?>image.
                    Because the question of interest is whether there is a gender effect on body
                    image,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the <em>explanatory</em> variable is
                            <em><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145144-0400"?>g<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145144-0400" content="G"?>ender</em>,
                        and</li>
                    <li>the <em>response</em> variable is <em><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145149-0400"?>b<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145149-0400" content="B"?>ody<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145151-0400"?>
                            <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145152-0400" content="-"?>image</em>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here is what the raw data look like when we include the gender of each
                    student:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/caseii2.gif" alt="A table of the data. There are
three columns, &quot;Student&quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;, and &quot;Body Image&quot;. &quot;Gender&quot; is the
Explanatory variable, and &quot;Body Image&quot; is the Response variable.
Some example data:
    ... (abbreviated) ...
    student 25, M, overweight;
    student 26, M, about right;
    student 27, F, underweight;
    student 28, F, about right;
    student 29, M, about right;
    ... (abbreviated) ..."/>
                <p>Once again the raw data is a long list of
                    1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145235-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>200
                    genders and
                    responses<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T145240-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    and thus not very useful in that form. To start our exploration of how body
                    image is related to gender, we need an informative display that summarizes the
                    data. In order to summarize the relationship between two categorical variables,
                    we create a display called a <em>two-way table</em>.</p>
                <p>Here is the two-way table for our example: </p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/caseii3.gif" alt="A two-way table. The columns are for
each possible category in &quot;Body Image&quot;. These categories are &quot;About Right&quot;, &quot;Overweight
&quot;, &quot;Underweight&quot;. There is also an additional column for Total. In addition, there is a row for
each of the categories in &quot;Gender&quot;. These are &quot;Female&quot; and &quot;Male&quot; There is also an
additional Total row. So, overall, there are 4 columns of the names &quot;About Right&quot;, &quot;Overweight&quot;,
&quot;Underweight&quot;, and &quot;Total&quot;. There are 3 rows, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, and
&quot;Total&quot;.
    Here are the values in the cells, in Row,Column: Value format:
    Female, About Right: 560;
    Female, Overweight: 163;
    Female, Underweight: 37;
    Female, Total: 760;
    Male, About Right: 295;
    Male, Overweight: 72;
    Male, Underweight: 73;
    Male, Total: 440;
    Total, About Right: 855;
    Total, Overweight: 235;
    Total, Under Weight: 110;
    Total, Total (Total # of Responses): 1200;"/>
                <p>The table has the possible genders in the rows, and the possible responses
                    regarding body image in the columns. At each intersection between row and
                    column, we put the counts for how many times that combination of gender and body
                    image occurred in the data. We sum across the rows to fill in the Total column,
                    and we sum across the columns to fill in the Total row.</p>
                <p>So for example,</p>

                <p>Note that from the way the two-way table is constructed, the Total row or column
                    is a summary of one of the two categorical variables, ignoring the other. In our
