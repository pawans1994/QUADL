<p>Let's start by looking at the following example:</p>
<example>
<title>Fire Damage</title>
<p>The scatterplot below illustrates how the number of firefighters sent to fires (X) is related to
                                                  the amount of damage caused by fires (Y) in a
                                                  certain city. <image style="block"
                                                  src="../webcontent/causation2.gif" alt="A
scatterplot in which the horizontal axis is labeled &quot;# Of Firefighters&quot;, and the vertical
axis is labeled &quot;Damage ($)&quot;. The vertical axis ranges from $0 to $2500000 and the
horizontal axis ranges from 0 to 40."/>
                                                </p>
<p>The scatterplot clearly displays a fairly strong (slightly curved) <em>positive</em> relationship
                                                  between the two variables. Would it, then, be
                                                  reasonable to conclude that sending more
                                                  firefighters to a fire causes more damage, or that
                                                  the city should send fewer firefighters to a fire,
                                                  in order to decrease the amount of damage done by
                                                  the fire?
                                                  Of
                                                  course not!  So what
                                                  is going on here?</p>
<p>There is a <em>third variable in the background</em>&#8212;the seriousness of the fire&#8212;that
                                                  is responsible for the observed relationship. More
                                                  serious fires require more firefighters, and also
                                                  cause more damage.</p>
<p>The following figure will help you visualize this situation:
			<image style="block" src="../webcontent/causation3.gif" alt="A flowchart. The &quot;
Seriousness of the fire&quot; is a &quot;lurking variable.&quot; This is a cause of both
&quot;Number of firefighters (X)&quot; and &quot;amount of damage (Y)&quot; We have
falsely observed a &quot;observed association&quot; between &quot;Number of firefighters (X)
&quot; and &quot;Amount of damage (Y)&quot;"/>
</p>
<p>Here, the seriousness of the fire is a <em>lurking variable. </em> A <em>lurking variable</em> is
                                                  a variable that is not among the explanatory or
                                                  response variables in a study, but could
                                                  substantially affect your interpretation of the
                                                  relationship among those variables.</p>
</example>
<p>In particular, as in our example, the lurking variable might have an effect on <em style="italic"
                                                  >both</em> the explanatory and the response
                                                variables. This common effect creates the observed
                                                association between the explanatory and response
                                                variables, even though there is no causal link
                                                between them. This possibility, that there might be
                                                a lurking variable (which we might not be thinking
                                                about) that is responsible for the observed
                                                relationship leads to our principle: </p>
		<theorem type="principle">
<statement><p>Association <em>does not</em> imply causation!</p></statement>
</theorem>
