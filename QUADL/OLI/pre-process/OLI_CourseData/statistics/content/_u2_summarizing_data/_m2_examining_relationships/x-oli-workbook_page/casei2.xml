            <title>SSHA</title>
            <p>The Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes (SSHA) is a psychological test designed to
                measure the motivation, study habits, and attitudes toward learning of college
                students. Is there a relationship between <em>gender</em> and <em>SSHA scores</em>?
                In other words, is there a "gender effect" on SSHA scores? Data were collected from
                40 randomly selected college students, and here is what the raw data look like: </p>

three columns: Student, Gender, and SSHA Score. Gender is the
Explanatory variable, and SSHA Score is the Response variable.

    Student 3, Male, 108;

            <p>In the following activities, let's explore the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes (SSHA) to determine if there is there a "gender effect" on SSHA scores.<!--Let's summarize our results and interpret them: By examining the side-by-side
                boxplots and the numerical summaries, we see that in general females perform better
                on the SSHA than males. The median SSHA score of females is higher than the median
                score for males (153 vs. 114), and in fact, it is even higher than the third
                quartile of the males' distribution (144.5). On the other hand, the males' scores
                display more variability, both in terms of IQR (49.5 vs. 35) and in terms of the
                full range of scores (117 vs. 97). Based on these results, it seems that there is a
                gender effect on SSHA score. It should be noted, though, that our sample consists of
                only 20 males and 20 females, so we should be cautious about making any kind of
                generalizations beyond this study. One interesting question that comes to mind is,
                "Why did we observe this relationship between gender and SSHA scores?" In other
                words, is there maybe an explanation for why females score higher on the SSHA? Let's
                leave it to the psychologists to try and answer that one. --></p>

                    <li>The relationship between a categorical explanatory variable and a

                    <li>Exploring the relationship between a categorical explanatory variable and a
                        quantitative response variable amounts to comparing the distributions of the
                        quantitative response for each category of the explanatory variable. In
                        particular, we look at how the distribution of the response variable differs
                        between the values of the explanatory variable. </li>
