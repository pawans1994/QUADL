               = 209.36 seconds. This is an extrapolation. We cannot be sure that the linear
               dependence of winning times upon years holds past the range of the explanatory
               variable, which is the year 2000. At some point, the linear dependence must no longer

&quot;The actual winning time of the 1,500 meter race in the 2008 Olympics was 212.94. The Olympic record of 212.07, set in 2000 by Noah Ngeny of Kenya, still stands after the Olympics of 2004 and 2008.&quot; "?>times.<?oxy_comment_end?></p>
