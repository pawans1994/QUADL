            <!--LO:Recognize the distinction between association and causation, and identify potential lurking variables for explaining an observed relationship.-->
            <body><p>The tourism industry hires a marketing company to promote overseas vacations. The
                marketing company's research shows a +0.72 correlation between the number of overseas
                vacations booked and amount of free time, in days, people have each year. Therefore,
                the marketing company decides to develop an advertising campaign aimed specifically
                at people who have lots of free time.</p><p>Which of the following is true about this
                    decision?</p></body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="false" select="single">
                <choice value="A">The decision may not be a good one, since it is possible that
                    there is a “lurking” variable, such as income, behind both the number of booked
                    overseas vacations and the number of free days people have each year.</choice>
                <choice value="B">The decision is a good one, since we know that the number of free
                    days people have cause them to book more vacations.</choice>
                <choice value="C">The decision is a good one, since there is a strong positive
                    relationship between number of booked vacations and the number of free days
                    people have each year.</choice>
                <!--<choice value="D">(d.) Both (b) and (c) are correct.</choice>
                <choice value="E">(e.) None of the above are correct.</choice>-->

                    <feedback>Correct. It is possible that there is lurking variable, such as
                        income, which is behind the relationship.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. Correlation does not mean causation. <!--Remember, correlation does not mean causation. Think about what a correlation can tell us about the relationship

                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. The correlation coefficient by itself isn’t enough to determine whether the relationship was linear. We would need to see the scatterplot to determine if the relationship was a straight-line trend.<!--Remember that the correlation coefficient by
                        itself isn’t enough to determine whether the relationship was linear. We’d

               <!-- <response match="D" score="0">
                    <feedback>That’s not quite right. It is possible that lurking variable, such as
                        income is behind the relationship. But remember that the correlation
