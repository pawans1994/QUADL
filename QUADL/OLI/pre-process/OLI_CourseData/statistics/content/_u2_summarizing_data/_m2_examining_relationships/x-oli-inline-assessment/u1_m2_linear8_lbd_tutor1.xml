            <p>The equation for the least squares regression line is: Time = 994 - 0.39 * Year. The
               slope of the line indicates that the winning time for the 1500 meter race decreases
               by about 0.39 seconds every year, or by about 4 * 0.39 = 1.56 seconds, on average, from
               one Olympiad to the next. (The fact that the times are decreasing rather than
               increasing is also indicated by the fact that the value of b is negative.)</p>
