               <feedback>Incorrect. You have selected two responses for the same variable, health

               <feedback>Incorrect. You have selected one of the variables, region,
                  which describes the entries for the rows. But your other selection, uninsured, is
                  a response, not a variable.</feedback>

               <feedback>Incorrect. You have selected one of the variables, region,
                  which describes the entries for the rows. These regions are in the United States,
                  but United States is not the variable. You have not chosen a variable for the

               <feedback>Correct. The entries for rows can be represented by the variable region,
                  while the entries for the columns can be represented by the variable health
                  insurance.</feedback>

               <feedback>Incorrect. You have selected one of the variables, health
                  insurance, which describes the entries for the columns. The row entries of
                  Northeast, Midwest, South, and West are all in the United States, but there is a
                  specific name for the variable.</feedback>
