<p>Let's go back now to our example, and use the scatterplot to examine the relationship between the
            age of the driver and the maximum
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T134524-0400"?>sign
            <?oxy_insert_end?>legibility distance. Here is the scatterplot: </p><image style="block"
                src="../webcontent/scatterplot15.gif" alt="A
scatterplot. The Y-Axis is labeled &quot;Sign Legibility Distance (feet)&quot;, and the X-axis is labeled
&quot;Driver Age (years)&quot; There are 30 points on the plot."/><p>The direction of the relationship is
                <em>negative</em>, which makes sense in
            context<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T135210-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            since as you get older your eyesight weakens, and in particular older drivers tend to be
            able to read signs only at lesser distances. An arrow drawn over the scatterplot
            illustrates the negative direction of this relationship: </p><image style="block"
                src="../webcontent/scatterplot16.gif" alt="A line from the upper left of the plot
to the lower right has been drawn. The points of the scatterplot roughly follow this line."/> <p>
            The form of the relationship seems to be <em>linear</em>. Notice how the points tend
            to be scattered about the line.
            Although, as we mentioned earlier, it is problematic to assess the strength without a
            numerical measure, the relationship appears to be <em>moderately strong</em>, as the
            data is fairly tightly scattered about the line. Finally, all the data points seem to
            "obey" the
            pattern<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T135324-0400"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T135321-0400" content="--"?>there
                <em>do not appear to be any outliers</em>.</p>
