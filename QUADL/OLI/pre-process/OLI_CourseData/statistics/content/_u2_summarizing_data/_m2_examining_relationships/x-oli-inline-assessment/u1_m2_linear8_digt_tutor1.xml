      <body>
         <p>Assume that you are given a scatterplot that has a regression line
            of Y = 4.2 + (−2)X. Which of the following is the correct
            interpretation of the slope?</p>
      </body>
      <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
         <choice value="Res3">For each decrease of one unit in the explanatory variable (X), we
            expect the response variable (Y) to decrease by two units.</choice>
         <choice value="Res2">For each increase of one unit in the explanatory variable (X), we
            expect the response variable (Y) to increase by two units.</choice>
         <choice value="Res4">For each increase of one unit in the explanatory variable (X), we
            expect the response variable (Y) to change by 4.2 + (−2) = 2.2 units.</choice>
         <choice value="Res1">For each increase of one unit in the explanatory variable (X), we
            expect the response variable (Y) to decrease by two units.</choice>

         <response match="Res3" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. The slope of this line is negative, since b = −2. This means that
               the two variables, X and Y, change inversely. In other words, if one increases, the
               other decreases, and vice versa.</feedback>

         <response match="Res4" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. You have predicted the value for the variable Y when X has a value
               of 1. This has nothing to do with an interpretation of slope. Slope describes how Y
               changes when Xx increases or decreases by a unit.</feedback>

         <response match="Res1" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct. The slope of this line is negative, since b = −2. This means that the
               two variables, X and Y, change inversely. In other words, if one increases, the other
               decreases, and vice versa. In particular, as X changes by one unit, Y will inversely
               change by 2 units.</feedback>
