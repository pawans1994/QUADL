            <!--LO:Recognize the distinction between association and causation, and identify potential lurking variables for explaining an observed relationship.-->
            <body><p>Research has suggested that there is a correlation between Internet usage and
                    obesity. Using this information, a fictional study found a correlation of r =
                    0.79 between the number of hours of daily Internet usage and Body Mass Index, a
                    measure of body weight.</p>
                <p>Which of the following is true? Check all that apply.</p>
            </body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="false" select="multiple">
                <choice value="A">There is a pretty strong positive linear relationship between the
                    number of hours spent on the Internet and the Body Mass Index scores.</choice>
                <choice value="B">Using the Internet causes people to gain weight.</choice>
                <choice value="C">Physical activity is a possible “lurking” variable behind this
                    relationship, since people who spend a large amount of time using the Internet
                    may be more likely to be less physically active.</choice>
                <!--<choice value="D">Both (a) and (c) are correct.</choice>
                <choice value="E">None of the above are correct.</choice>-->

                    <feedback>Incorrect. The correlation coefficient by itself isn’t enough to
                        determine whether the relationship was linear. We would need to see the
                        scatterplot to determine if the relationship was a straight-line trend.
