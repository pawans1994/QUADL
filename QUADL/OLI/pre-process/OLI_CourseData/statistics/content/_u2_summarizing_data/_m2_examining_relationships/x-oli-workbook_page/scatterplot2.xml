<section>
<title>Interpreting the scatterplot</title>
<body>
        <p>How do we explore the relationship between two quantitative variables using the
          scatterplot? What should we look at, or pay attention to? </p>
        <p>Recall that when we described the distribution of a single quantitative variable with a
          histogram, we described the overall pattern of the distribution (shape, center, spread)
          and any deviations from that pattern (outliers). <em>We do the same thing with the
            scatterplot.</em> The following figure summarizes this point: </p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/scatterplot5.gif" alt="When describing the relationship
between two quantitative variables using a scatterplot, we look at: (1) The overall pattern, which can
be described using direction, form, and strength. We also look at (2) Deviations from the pattern,
which result from outliers."/>
        <p>As the figure explains, when describing the <em>overall pattern</em> of the relationship
          we look at its direction, form and strength.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The <em>direction</em> of the relationship can be positive, negative, or neither:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/scatterplot6.gif" alt="A positive relationship. In
this case, we traverse left across the x-axis, the y values tend to increase. In other words, the points
on the scatterplot appear to be in a shape which roughly resembles a line going from the bottom left to
the top right of the scatter plot. Note that the points are not necessarily actually in a line, but
instead their general shape appears to create a trend."/>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/scatterplot7.gif" alt="A negative relationship. In
this case, we traverse left across the x-axis, the y values tend to decrease. In other words, the points
on the scatterplot appear to be in a shape which roughly resembles a line going from the top left to
the bottom right of the scatter plot. Just as in the positive relationship, the points do not have to
be on this imaginary line, they merely appear to create a trend that goes from the upper left to lower
right."/>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/scatterplot8.gif" alt="Neither positive nor negative.
The points here do not create a trend like in the positive or negative cases. In this example, they seem
to create a V shape."/>
            <p>A <em>positive (or increasing) relationship</em> means that an increase in one of the
              variables is associated with an increase in the other.</p>
            <p>A <em>negative (or decreasing) relationship</em> means that an increase in one of the
              variables is associated with a decrease in the other.</p>
            <p>Not all relationships can be classified as either positive or negative. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <em>form</em> of the relationship is its general shape. When identifying the
              form, we try to find the simplest way to describe the shape of the scatterplot. There
              are many possible forms. Here are a couple that are quite common: </p>
            <p>Relationships with a <em>linear</em> form are most simply described as points
              scattered about a line: </p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/scatterplot9.gif" alt="A scatterplot in which the points
are slightly above or below a line which has been drawn through the points. Overall, the points create a shape
that appears to be a fat line. In this example, the points create a negative relationship."/>
            <p>Relationships with a <em>curvilinear</em> form are most simply described as points
              dispersed around the same curved line: </p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/scatterplot10.gif" alt="Here, the points in the scatterplot
are slightly above or below a line which curves."/>
            <p>There are many other possible forms for the relationship between two quantitative
              variables, but linear and curvilinear forms are quite common and easy to identify.
              Another form-related pattern that we should be aware of is
              <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T134104-0400" comment="Should this be bold, to indicate new terminology?"?>clusters<?oxy_comment_end?>
              in the data: </p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/scatterplot11.gif" alt="The points in this scatterplot create
two groups. The points in a group are close together, and in between the two groups is an empty space in which
there are no points. These groups are clusters."/>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <em>strength</em> of the relationship is determined by how closely the data
              follow the form of the relationship. Let's look, for example, at the following two
              scatterplots displaying positive, linear relationships:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/scatterplot12.gif" alt="A line has been drawn through
the points in this scatter plot. The points are very close to the line. This is a strong relationship."/>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/scatterplot13.gif" alt="Like the previous example, a 
line has been drawn through the points in the scatterplot. However, there are points both close to the line
and quite far. Taken as a whole, the points appear to make a trapezoid instead of a line. This is a weaker
relationship than the previous example."/>
            <p>The strength of the relationship is determined by how closely the data points follow
              the form. We can see that in the top scatterplot the data points follow the linear
              pattern quite closely. This is an example of a strong relationship. In the bottom
              scatterplot, the points also follow the linear pattern, but much less closely, and
              therefore we can say that the relationship is weaker. In general, though, assessing
              the strength of a relationship just by looking at the scatterplot is quite
              problematic, and we need a numerical measure to help us with that.
              <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T164803-0400" comment="It is not discussed on any of the scatterplot pages. Consider changing wording to &quot;later in this course&quot;"?>We
              will discuss that later in this section. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <?oxy_comment_end?>
        <p>Data points that <em>deviate from the pattern</em> of the relationship are called
            <em>outliers</em>. We will see several examples of outliers during this section. Two
          outliers are illustrated in the scatterplot below: </p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/scatterplot14.gif" alt="A scatterplot which has a positive
relationship. Most of the points are in a line-like shape from the bottom left of the plot to the top right.
However, there are two points which do not match this trend. One is far below the majority of the points and
the other is far left. These points do not participate in the line-like shape at all."/>
