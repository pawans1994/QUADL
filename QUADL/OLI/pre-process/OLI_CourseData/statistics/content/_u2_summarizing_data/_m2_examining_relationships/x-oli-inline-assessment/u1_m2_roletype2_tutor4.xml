         <p>A study was conducted in order to determine whether longevity (how long a person lives)
               is related to a person's handedness (right-handed/left-handed).</p>
         <p>This study is an example of which role-type classification?<!--This study is an example of:--></p>

            <feedback>Correct. In this case, the explanatory variable (handedness) is categorical, and
                  the response variable (longevity) is quantitative. Therefore, this is an example
                  of case C→Q.</feedback>

         <response match="Res2" score="0">
            <feedback>Not quite right. The two relevant variables here are longevity and handedness. You are correct that the explanatory variable (handedness) is categorical. Is the response variable categorical or quantitative?<!--The two relevant variables here are longevity and handedness.   First decide which is the explanatory variable and which is the response variable.  Then decide if each is categorical or quantitative.  Please try again.--></feedback>

            <feedback>Incorrect. The two relevant variables here are longevity and handedness. It appears you switched the order of the explanatory and response variables. The first letter refers to the <em style="italic">explanatory</em> variable, in this case, handedness, and the second letter refers to the <em style="italic">response</em> variable, longevity.<!--The two relevant variables here are longevity and handedness.

         <hint>The two relevant variables here are longevity and handedness. Determine the role-type
               classification for these two variables.</hint>
