<title>Case Câ†’C (2 of 2)</title>

<body>
   
<p>So far, we have organized the raw data in a much more informative display&#8212;the two-way
         table:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/caseii6.gif" alt="The same table as on the previous page.
The description of it for reference: A two-way table. The columns are for
each possible category in Body Image, which are About Right,
Overweight, and Underweight, plus a Total column.
There is a row for each of the categories in Gender, which are 
Female and Male, plus a Total row. So, overall,
there are 4 columns of the names About Right, Overweight,
Underweight, and Total. There are 3 rows, Female,
Male, and Total. Here are the values in the cells, in Row, Column: Value format:
      Female, About Right: 560;
      Female, Overweight: 163;
      Female, Underweight: 37;
      Female, Total: 760;
      Male, About Right: 295;
      Male, Overweight: 72;
      Male, Underweight: 73;
      Male, Total: 440;
      Total, About Right: 855;
      Total, Overweight: 235;
      Total, Under Weight: 110;
      Total, Total (Total # of Responses): 1200;"/>
<p>Remember, though, that our primary goal is to explore how body image is related to gender.
         Exploring the relationship between two categorical variables (in this case, body image and
         gender) amounts to comparing the distributions of the response variable (in this case body
         image) across the different values of the explanatory variable (in this case, males and
         females): </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/caseii7.gif" alt="The two-way table with the Female
and Male rows highlighted. These are the rows for which we need to compare distributions."/>
<p>Note that it doesn't make sense to compare raw counts, because there are more females than males
         overall. So, for example, it is not very informative to say, "There are 560 females who
         responded 'about right' compared to only 295 males," since the 560 females are out of a
         total of 760, and the 295 males are out of a total of only 440. </p>
<p>We need to supplement our display, the two-way table, with some numerical summaries that will
         allow us to compare the distributions. These numerical summaries are found by simply <em
            style="bold">converting the counts to percentages within (or restricted to) each value of the explanatory variable
            separately</em>.
      </p>
<p>In our example, we look at each gender separately and convert the counts to percentages <em
            style="bold">within that gender</em>. Let's start with females: </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/caseii8.gif" alt="The same table, but with percentages
instead, and without the Total row. Here are the cells, in Row, Column: Value format:
   Female, About Right: 560/760 = 73.7%;
   Female, Overweight: 163/760 = 21.5%;
   Female, Underweight: 37/760 = 4.9%;
   Female, Total: 760/760 = 100%;
   The Male row is blank."/>
<p>Note that each count is converted to percents by dividing by the total number of females, 760.
         These numerical summaries are called <em style="bold">conditional
            percentages</em>, since we find them by "conditioning" on one of the
         genders. </p>

<p>In our example, we chose to organize the data with the explanatory variable gender in rows and
                     the response variable body image in columns, and thus our conditional percentages
                     were <em style="bold"
                        >row
                        percentages</em>, calculated within each row separately.
                     Similarly, if the explanatory variable happens to sit in columns and the
                     response variable in rows, our conditional percentages will be<em style="bold">column
                        percentages</em>, calculated within each column separately.
                     For an example, see the "Did I Get This?" exercises below.</p>

<p>Another way to visualize the conditional percentages, instead of in a table, is to use a <em
                        style="bold"
                        >double bar chart</em>. This display is quite common in
                     newspapers. </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/caseii9.gif" alt="A two-way table, the same as the previous
table explaining conditional percentages. However, the Male row has been filled in. The cells are
in Row, Column: Value format:
   Female, About Right: 73.7%;
   Female, Overweight: 21.4%;
   Female, Underweight: 4.9%;
   Female, Total: 100%;
   Male, About Right: 67.0%;
   Male, Overweight: 16.4%;
   Male, Underweight: 16.6%;
   Male, Total: 100%;
   
   Below this is a double bar chart. The vertical axis is labeled Percent and
ranges from 0 to 80%. The horizontal axis is labeled Body Image. Three
subcategories make up three groups of bars. These categories are about right,
overweight, and underweight. Each category has two bars, one for male
and one for female, for a total of 6 bars in the graph. Here are the bars and their values:
   About Right,Female: 73.7%
   About Right, Male: 67.0%
   Overweight, Female: 21.4%
   Overweight, Male: 16.4%
   Underweight, Female: 4.9%
   Underweight, Male: 16.6%"/>

<p>Now that we have summarized the relationship between the categorical variables gender and body
         image, let's go back and interpret the results in the context of the questions that we
         posed. </p>

       <p>Suppose a study were done to answer the question: "Is the smoking of students related to
               their parents' smoking habits?" in which data were collected from 5,375 students and
               organized in the following two-way table: </p>
       <image src="../webcontent/caseii10.gif" alt="A two-way table. The columns are labeled with the possible
categories in the Parents' Smoking variable: Parents Do Not Smoke and Parents
Smoke. In addition, there is a Total column. The rows are labeled with the possible categories
in the variable Student Smoking: Student Does Not Smoke and Student Smokes.
There is also a Total row. Here is the data in the table in Row, Column: Value format:
   Student Does Not Smoke, Parents Do Not Smoke: 1168;
   Student Does Not Smoke, Parents Smoke: 3203;
   Student Does Not Smoke, Total: 4371;
   Student Smokes, Parents Do Not Smoke: 188;
   Student Smokes, Parents Smoke: 816;
   Student Smokes, Total: 1004;
   Total, Parents Do Not Smoke: 1356;
   Total, Parents Smoke: 4019;
   Total, Total: 5375"/>

<li>The relationship between two categorical variables is summarized using

                           >Numerical summaries:</em> Conditional percentages. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conditional percentages are calculated for each value of the explanatory variable separately.
                  They can be row percentages if the explanatory variable "sits" in the rows, or
                  column percentages if the explanatory variable "sits" in the columns. </li>
<li>When we try to understand the relationship between two categorical variables, we compare the distributions of the
   response variable for values of the explanatory variable. In particular, we look at how the pattern of
   conditional percentages differs between the values of the explanatory variable.
