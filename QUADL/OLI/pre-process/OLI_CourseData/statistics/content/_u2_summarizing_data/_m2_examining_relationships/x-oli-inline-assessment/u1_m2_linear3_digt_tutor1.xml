            <hint>You may find it easier to look at the scatterplots for all 6 questions first. You
               will notice that the correlation coefficients (r) are the same for all of the
               questions. So, you can think of this as a matching exercise in which each correlation
               coefficient is used only once.</hint>
            <hint>For each scatterplot, first determine the direction of the relationship, and then
               determine the strength of the linear relationship.</hint>
