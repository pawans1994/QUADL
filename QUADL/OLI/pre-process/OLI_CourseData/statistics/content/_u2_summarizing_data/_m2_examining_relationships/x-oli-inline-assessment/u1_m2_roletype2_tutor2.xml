          <p>A store asked 250 of its customers whether or not they were satisfied with the service.
               The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the customer's
               satisfaction and gender.</p>
         <p>This study is an example of which role-type classification?<!--This study is an example of:--></p>

            <feedback>Not quite right. We are examining how gender affects satisfaction. You are correct that the explanatory variable, gender, is categorical. Is the response variable categorical or quantitative?<!--We are examining how gender affects satisfaction.

            <feedback>Correct. Both the explanatory (gender) and response (satisfaction) variables
                  are categorical in this case. Therefore, this is an example of case
                  C→C.</feedback>

         <hint>The two relevant variables here are gender (male or female) and satisfaction (yes or
               no). Determine the role-type classification for these two variables.</hint>
