<title>Creating a Labeled Scatterplot</title>
<body>
<p>The scatterplot below displays the relationship between the sodium and calorie content of 54
                    brands of hot dogs. Note that in this example there is no clear
                    explanatory-response distinction, and we decided to have sodium content as the
                    explanatory variable, and calorie content as the
                    response<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T155746-0400"?>
                    variable<?oxy_insert_end?>. </p>
<image style="block" src="../../webcontent/scatterplot20.gif"/>
<p>The scatterplot displays a positive relationship, which means that hot dogs 
containing more sodium tend to be higher in calories. </p>
<image style="block" src="../../webcontent/scatterplot21.gif"/>
<p>The form of the relationship, however, is kind of hard to determine. Maybe if we label the
                    scatterplot, indicating the type of hot<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T155815-0400"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>dogs, we
                    w<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T155851-0400"?>ill<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T155849-0400" content="ould"?>
                    get a better understanding of the form. </p>
<p>Here is the labeled scatterplot, with the three different colors representing 
the three types of hot dogs, as indicated. </p>

<p>The display
                    <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T160321-0400" comment="Perhaps it would be a good idea, here and in the actual walkthrough, to add an explanation of how this helps us determine the form:

With the types of hot dogs labeled, it is easier to see that the relationship between calories and sodium is fairly linear for both beef and meat hot dogs."?>does
                    give us more insight about the form of the relationship between sodium and
                    calorie content.<?oxy_comment_end?>
                </p>
<image style="block" src="../../webcontent/scatterplot23.gif"/>
<p>It appears that there is a positive relationship within all three types. In other words, we can
                    generally expect hot dogs that are higher in sodium to be higher in
                    calories<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T155925-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    no matter what type of hot dog we consider. In addition, we can see that hot
                    dogs made of poultry (indicated in blue) are generally lower in calories. This
                    is a result we have seen before. </p>
<p>Interestingly, it appears that the form of the relationship specifically for 
poultry is further clustered, and</p>
<image style="block" src="../../webcontent/scatterplot24.gif"/>
<p>we can only speculate about whether there is another categorical variable that describes these
                    apparent sub-categories of poultry hot dogs. </p>
