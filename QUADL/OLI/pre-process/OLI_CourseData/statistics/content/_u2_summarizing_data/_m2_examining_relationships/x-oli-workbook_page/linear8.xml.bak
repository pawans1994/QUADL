        <p>Let's go back now to our motivating example, in which we wanted to predict the maximum
            distance at which a sign is legible for a 60-year-old. Now that we have found the least
            squares
            <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T150137-0400" comment="Suggest replacing graphic to clarify formula to &quot;Distance = 576 + (-3 * Age)&quot;"?>regression

Distance. Now that we have a regression line, finding out the maximum distance at which a sign is legible
for a 60-year-old person is easy. We simply check at what y coordinate does the regression line cross
a vertical line at x = 60. This happens to be at y = 396."
            />
        </p>
        <p>Practically, what the figure tells us is that in order to find the predicted legibility
            distance for a 60-year-old, we plug Age = 60 into the regression line equation, to find
            that: <formula style="block">Predicted distance = 576 + (- 3 * 60) = 396</formula>
        </p>
        <p>396 feet is our best prediction for the maximum distance at which a sign is legible for a
            60-year-old.</p>

                <p>Suppose a government agency wanted to design a sign appropriate for an even wider
                    range of drivers than were present in the original study. They want to predict
                    the maximum distance at which the sign would be legible for a 90-year-old. Using
                    the least squares regression line again as our summary of the linear dependence
                    of the distances upon the drivers' ages, the agency predicts that 90-year-old
                    drivers can see the sign at no more than 576 + (- 3 * 90) = 306 feet: <image

The scatterplot for Driver Age vs. Sign Legibility Distance. The scales of both axes have been
enlarged so that the regression line has room on the right to be extended past where data exists.
The regression line is negative, so it grows from the upper left to the lower right of the plot.
Where the regression line is creating an estimate in between existing data, it is red. Beyond that,
where there are no data points, the line is green. This area is x&gt;82. The equation of the
regression line is Distance = 576 - 3 * Age"

                <p>Prediction for ranges of the explanatory variable that are not in the data is
                    called <em>extrapolation</em>. Since there is no way of knowing whether a
                    relationship holds beyond the range of the explanatory variable in the data,
                    extrapolation is not reliable, and should be avoided. In our example, like most
                    others, extrapolation can lead to very poor or illogical predictions. </p>

            <title>Let's Summarize</title>
            <body>
                <ul>
                    <li>A special case of the relationship between two quantitative variables is the
                            <em>linear </em>relationship. In this case, a straight line simply and
                        adequately summarizes the relationship.</li>
                    <li>When the scatterplot displays a linear relationship, we supplement it with
                        the <em>correlation coefficient (r)</em>, which measures the
                            <em>strength</em> and
                        <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T191151-0400" comment="make bold to indicate terminology"?>direction<?oxy_comment_end?>
                        of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables. The correlation
                        ranges between -1 and 1. Values near -1 indicate a strong negative linear
                        relationship, values near 0 indicate a weak linear relationship, and values
                        near 1 indicate a strong positive linear relationship.</li>
                    <li>The correlation is only an appropriate numerical measure for linear
                        relationships, and is sensitive to outliers. Therefore, the correlation
                        should only be used as a supplement to a scatterplot (after we look at the
                        data).</li>
                    <li>The most commonly used criterion for finding a line that summarizes the
                        pattern of a linear relationship is "least squares." The <em>least squares
                            regression line </em> has the smallest sum of squared vertical
                        deviations of the data points from the line.</li>
                    <li>The slope of the least squares regression line can be interpreted as the
                        average change in the response variable when the explanatory variable
                        increases by 1 unit.</li>
                    <li>The least squares regression line predicts the value of the response
                        variable for a given value of the explanatory variable.
                            <em>Extrapolation</em> is prediction of values of the explanatory
                        variable that fall outside the range of the data. Since there is no way of
                        knowing whether a relationship holds beyond the range of the explanatory
                        variable in the data, extrapolation is not reliable, and should be
                        avoided.</li>
