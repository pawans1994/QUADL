<p>The technique that specifies the dependence of the response variable on the explanatory variable
            is called <em>regression</em>. When that dependence is linear (which is
            <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T131353-0400" content="our"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T131355-0400"?>the<?oxy_insert_end?>
            case<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T131358-0400"?> in our
            examples in this section<?oxy_insert_end?>), the technique is called <em>linear
                regression</em>. Linear regression is therefore the technique of finding the line
            that best fits the pattern of the linear relationship (or in other words, the line that
            best describes how the response variable linearly depends on the explanatory
            variable).</p>
<p>To understand how such a line is chosen, consider the following very simplified version of the age-distance example (we left just 6 of the drivers on the scatterplot):
		<image style="block" src="../webcontent/linear9.gif" alt="The scatterplot of Sign Legibility
vs. Driver Age with only 6 data points. The data points chosen to be shown roughly make a parallelogram,
whose top and bottom sides represent negative relationships."/>
</p>
<p>There are many lines that
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T131859-0400"?>look like they
            would be
            <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T131858-0400" content="are"?>
            good candidates to be the line that best fits the <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T132425-0400" comment="Students might wonder why all of the lines intersect at a certain point. If this is always the case, consider explaining why that is the case. If this is not always the case, consider replacing this graphic with one in which the lines don&apos;t all appear to intersect at the same place."?>data:<?oxy_comment_end?>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/linear10.gif" alt="The same scatterplot the
6 data points. Five different lines have been drawn from the upper left region of the plot to
the lower right. They all intersect the parallelogram created by the 6 data points in a way
such that each line is above 3 points and below 3 points. These lines are potential
candidates. There are many other lines which could be used to fit the data."/>
        </p>
<p>It is doubtful that everyone would select the same line in the plot above. We need to agree on
            what we mean by "best fits the data"; in other words, we need to agree on a criterion by
            which we would select this line. We want the line we choose to be close to the data
            points. In other words, whatever criterion we choose, it had better somehow take into
            account the vertical deviations of the data points from the line, which are marked
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T132000-0400"?>with<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T131958-0400" content="in"?>
            blue arrows in the plot below: <image style="block" src="../webcontent/linear11.gif" alt="
The same scatterplot with 6 points. A potential line has been drawn, and a vertical line from each
data point to the line has also been drawn. The length of these vertical lines have to be taken into
acount when choosing a best fit line."/>
        </p>
<p>The most commonly used criterion is called the <em>least squares</em> criterion. This criterion
            says: Among all the lines that look good on your data, choose the one that has the
            smallest sum of squared vertical deviations. Visually, each squared deviation is
            represented by the area of one of the squares in the plot below. Therefore, we are
            looking for the line that will have the smallest total yellow area. <image style="block"
                src="../webcontent/linear12.gif" alt="The same scatterplot with 6 data points.
A line has been chosen, and for each of the 6 data points, a vertical line is drawn from the data
point to the line. A square is then drawn, one side using this line, so that all 4 sides are the
same length as the vertical line. For all 6 data points we have 6 different vertical lines and thus
6 different squares. The least squares criterion looks to reduce the total area of these squares."/>
            This line is called the <em>least-squares regression line</em>,
            and<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T132614-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            as we'll see, it fits the linear pattern of the data very well. </p>

<link href="http://www.duxbury.com/authors/mcclellandg/tiein/johnson/reg.htm" target="new">This applet</link> illustrates the least squares criterion, and  allows you to practice fitting a regression line to describe the relationship between height and weight in some data on a group of college women.  Click in the applet to move the line, and observe the resulting changes to the area of the squares - the squared vertical distances between the line and the data.  Move the line until you believe you have found the <em>least-squares regression line</em>.  Click the button entitled "Find Best Model" to compare your line to the true least-squares regression line.  Note: Don't worry about the unfamiliar word "model" at the top, you can think of it as meaning "line" for our purposes. </p>
<p>At the top of the applet, notice the equation:
		<formula style="block">WEIGHT = -186.5 + 4.7 * HEIGHT</formula>
</p>
<p>This is the equation for the least-squares regression line. </p>-->
<p>For the remainder of this lesson, you'll need to feel comfortable with the algebra of a straight
            line. In particular you'll need to be familiar with the <em>slope </em> and the
                <em>intercept </em>in the equation of a
            line<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T132631-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            and their interpretation.</p>
