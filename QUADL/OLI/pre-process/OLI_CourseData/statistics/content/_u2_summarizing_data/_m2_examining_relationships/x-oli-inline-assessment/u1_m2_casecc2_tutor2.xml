<body> The results suggest that the proportion of males who are happy with their body weight is
                <input_ref input="A"/> than among female students. Females who are not happy with
            their body weight more often feel they are <input_ref input="B"/>. Males who are not
            happy with their body weight feel they are overweight <input_ref input="C"/> they feel
            they are underweight. </body>
