      <body>
         <p>Do the data provide evidence that early light exposure causes myopia?</p>

         <explanation>
            <p>Association does not imply causation. We cannot conclude that light exposure in early childhood somehow causes myopia in older children. The data is suggestive of a relationship, but we can't rule out the possibility that a lurking variable is associated with parents' use of light with their young children and the children's later myopia.</p>
