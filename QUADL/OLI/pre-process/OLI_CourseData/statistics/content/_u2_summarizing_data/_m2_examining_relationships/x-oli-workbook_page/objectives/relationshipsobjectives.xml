<p>
By the end of the section on examining relationships, you should be able 
to:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Classify a data analysis situation (involving two variables) according to the "role type
            classification<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T165724-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>"<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T165726-0400" content=","?>
            and state the appropriate display and/or numerical measures that should be used in order
            to summarize the data. </li>
<li>Produce a two-way table, and interpret the information stored in it about the association
            between two
            cat<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T165747-0400" content="."?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T165750-0400"?>egorical<?oxy_insert_end?>
            variables by comparing conditional percents. </li>
<li>Graphically display the relationship between two quantitative
   variables and describe:
   <!--:ERROR: Lists cannot be used within a paragraph.--><ul>
<li>the overall pattern<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T165829-0400"?>,
                  and<?oxy_insert_end?>
               </li>
<li>striking deviations from the
                  pattern<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T165836-0400"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interpret the value of the correlation coefficient, and be aware of
   its limitations as a numerical measure of the association between 
   two quantitative variables.

</li>
<li>In the special case of linear relationship, use the least squares 
   regression line as a summary of the overall pattern and use it to 
   make predictions.

</li>
<li>Recognize the distinction between association and
   causation, and identify potential lurking variables for explaining 
   an observed relationship.

</li>
<li>Recognize and explain the phenomenon of Simpson's Paradox as it
   relates to interpreting the relationship between two variables.
