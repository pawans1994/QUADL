            <p>Of the three groups of children, those who were exposed to no light at all were least
                  likely to be nearsighted, with an incidence of <em>9.9%</em>. Those exposed to a
                  night<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101022T003201-0400"?>-<?oxy_insert_end?>light
                  were nearsighted

                  of the time, and those exposed to a lamp were nearsighted <em>54.7%</em> of the
                  time. Note that these
                  percent<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101021T114651-0400"?>age<?oxy_insert_end?>s
                  show that children who slept with a lamp were about 5 times more likely to develop
                  nearsightedness than the children who slept with no light.</p><p>Based upon this data alone, parents might discontinue using

                  and lamps with young children, as their use seems to be associated with
                  nearsightedness when the children grow up. However, there is a strong argument
                  against this conclusion, which will be presented in a later lesson. </p>
