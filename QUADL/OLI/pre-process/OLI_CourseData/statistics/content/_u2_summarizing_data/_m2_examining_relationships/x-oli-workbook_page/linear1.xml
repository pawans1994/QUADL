<p>So far we have visualized relationships between two quantitative variables using scatterplots,
                    and described the overall pattern of
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T170905-0400"?>a<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T170903-0400" content="the"?>
                    relationship by considering its direction, form, and strength. We noted that
                    assessing the strength of a relationship just by looking at the scatterplot is
                    quite
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T170925-0400"?>difficult<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T170923-0400" content="hard"?>,
                    and therefore we need to supplement the scatterplot with some kind of numerical
                    measure that will help us assess the strength. </p>
<p>In this part, we will restrict our attention to the <em>special case of relationships that have a linear form</em>, since they are quite common and relatively simple to detect. More importantly, there exists a numerical measure that assesses the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables with which we can supplement the scatterplot.
We will introduce this numerical measure here and discuss it in detail.

</p>
<p>Even though from this point on we are going to focus only on linear relationships, it is
                    important to remember that <em>not every relationship between two quantitative
                        variables has a linear
                        form<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T171239-0400"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T171237-0400" content="! "?></em>
                    We have actually seen several examples of relationships that are not linear. The
                    statistical tools that will be introduced here are <em>appropriate only for
                        examining linear
                        relationships,<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T171311-0400" content=" "?></em>
                    and as we<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T171344-0400"?>
                    wi<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T171348-0400" content="&apos;"?>ll
                    see, when
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T171333-0400"?>they are
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>used in

                    situations, these tools can lead to errors in reasoning. </p>
<p>Let's start with
                    <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T173410-0400" comment="using this word kind of gives away the &quot;trick.&quot; Consider saying just &quot;an example&quot;"?>a
                    motivating<?oxy_comment_end?> example. Consider the following two scatterplots. </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/linear1.gif" alt="Two scatterplots, displaying the same
data. However, the first scatterplot has a much larger scale on its axes than the second.
Because of this, the first scatterplot has its data points clustered closer together than in
the second scatterplot. Both have their points arranged roughly in a linear manner. In
addition, the second scatterplot appears to have some outliers. All this is merely
due to the scale change."/>
<p>We can see that in both cases, the direction of the relationship is <em>positive</em> and the form of the relationship is <em>linear</em>. What about the strength? Recall that the strength of a relationship is the extent to which the data follow its form. </p>

<p>The purpose of this example was to illustrate how assessing the strength of the linear
                    relationship from a scatterplot alone is problematic, since our judgment might
                    be affected by
                    <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T173537-0400" comment="I thought the wording could be confusing. Change OK?"?>the
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T173156-0400"?>scale on
                    which the
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T173212-0400" content="range of "?>values

                    plotted. This example, therefore, provides a motivation for the <em>need </em>to
                    supplement the scatterplot with a <em>numerical
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T173441-0400"?><?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T173604-0400" comment="It was called a measure rather than a summary before.

                    that will <em>measure the strength</em> of the linear relationship between two
                    quantitative variables. </p>
