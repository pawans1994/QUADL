            <p>A researcher wants to determine if preschool attendance is associated with high
                school graduation for low-income students. She randomly assigns low-income children
                to two groups; one group will attend preschool program, the second group will not
                attend preschool. The researcher plans to follow the children in the study for 20
                years and observe whether or not they graduate from high school.</p>
            <p>Which of the following is the explanatory variable in this study?</p>
