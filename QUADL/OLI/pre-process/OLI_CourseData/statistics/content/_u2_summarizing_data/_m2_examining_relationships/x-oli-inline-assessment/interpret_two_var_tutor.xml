            <!--LO:Recognize and explain the phenomenon of Simpson's paradox as it relates to interpreting the relationship between two variables.-->
            <body><p>A study was done on the graduation rates (graduate in 4 years versus did not graduate) from two universities: Mode College and Median University. Data were collected for the year 2012 in a variety of majors, and it was found that Mode College does better overall (i.e., has a higher percentage of students who graduate in 4 years). However, in each of the majors separately, Median University does better.</p>
                <p>Which of the following is true? Check all that apply.</p>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. It is appropriate to call an association "positive" or "negative" only when the variables are quantitative. But in this case, both variables ("graduation" and "major") are categorical. Also, there is at least one true statement.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. An association can sometimes be seen in a particular way for each of several groups separately, but when the groups are combined, the association can “reverse,” so this situation is mathematically possible.

                    <feedback>Correct. This is an example of Simpson’s paradox, because there is an
                        association between two variables that "reverses” when . Such reversal
                        typically indicates a lurking variable, which in this case is type of
                        major.</feedback>
