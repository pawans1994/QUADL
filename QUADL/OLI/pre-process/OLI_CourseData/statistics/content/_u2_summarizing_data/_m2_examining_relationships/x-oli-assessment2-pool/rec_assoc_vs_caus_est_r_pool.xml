            <p>A local city council’s study found that the correlation between number of liquor
                stores in a neighborhood and neighborhood crime rates across all city neighborhoods
                was r = 0.88.</p>
            <p>Which one of the following statements is true?</p>

        <input labels="false" shuffle="true">
            <choice value="A">There is a pretty strong positive linear relationship between number
                of liquor stores and crime rates.</choice>
            <choice value="B">Closing liquor stores in a neighborhood will help to reduce the crime
                rate of that neighborhood.</choice>
            <choice value="C">Population is a possible lurking variable in this scenario, since
                areas that are more densely populated are more likely to have higher crime
                rates.</choice>
            <choice value="D">As the number of liquor stores increase the crime rate will increase
                in that neighborhood.</choice>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Although r = 0.88 does indicate a strong positive association,
                    remember that correlation alone is not enough for us to determine that the

                <feedback>Correct. Temperature is a possible lurking variable, since the sales of

                    the cold parts of the year. So the sales would tend to be positively associated
                    (both low at the same time, both high at the same time), which would explain the
