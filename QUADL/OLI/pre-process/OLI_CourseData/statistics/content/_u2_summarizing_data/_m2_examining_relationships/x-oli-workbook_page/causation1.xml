<title>Introduction</title>
<body>
<p>So far we have discussed different ways in which data can be used to explore the relationship (or
                    association) between two variables. To frame our discussion we followed the
                    role-type classification table: <image style="block"
                        src="../webcontent/causation1.gif" height="500" width="700" alt="It is possible
for any type of explanatory variable to be paired with any type of response variable.
The possible pairings are:
Categorical Explanatory → Categorical Response (C→C),
Categorical Explanatory → Quantitative Response (C→Q),
Quantitative Explanatory → Categorical Response (Q→C), and
Quantitative Explanatory → Quantitative Response (Q→Q)."/>
                    and we have now completed learning how
                    to explore the relationship in cases C→Q, C→C, and Q→Q. (As noted before, case
                    Q→C will not be discussed in this course.) When we explore the relationship
                    between two variables, there is often a temptation to conclude from the observed
                    relationship that changes in the explanatory variable <em>cause</em> changes in
                    the response variable. In other words, you might be tempted to interpret the
                    observed association as causation. The purpose of this part of the course is to
                    convince you that this kind of interpretation is often <em style="italic"
                        >wrong!</em> The motto of this section is one of the most fundamental
                    principles of this course: </p>
			<theorem type="principle">
<statement><p>Association <em>does not</em> imply causation!</p></statement>
