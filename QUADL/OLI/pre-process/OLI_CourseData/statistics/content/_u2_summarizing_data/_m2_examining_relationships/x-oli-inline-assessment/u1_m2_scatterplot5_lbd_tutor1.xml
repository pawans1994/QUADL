         <p>Describe the relationship between the height and weight of the subjects suggested by the
            data. Consider the pattern of the

            <p>The direction of the relationship is positive. In context, this means that
               individuals who are taller are heavier. The form of the relationship is curvilinear.
               Weight seems to increase more and more rapidly with height as we consider taller
               individuals. We might say that the relationship is moderate in strength, because the
               points suggest, but do not closely follow, a curvilinear form. There do not appear to
               be any outliers.</p>
