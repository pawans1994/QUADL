      <body>
         <p>Report the new value for the correlation between gestation and longevity and compare it
            to the value you found earlier when the outlier was included. What is it about this
            outlier that
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T124851-0400"?>results in the fact
            that <?oxy_insert_end?>its inclusion in the data causes the correlation to increase?
            (Hint: look at the scatterplot.)</p>

            <p>After removing the outlier, the correlation drops from .663 to .519. The elephant is
               an outlier,
               however<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T124915-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
               it is consistent with the linear form of the relationship between longevity and
               gestation period. In this case, it would be most informative to report both
               correlations. </p>
