        <p>You have now completed the module on examining relationships, which is the second (and
            last) module within the Exploratory Data Aanalysis unit. You've learned how to explore
            the relationship between the explanatory and response variables using visual displays
            and numerical measures, and how to choose the type of measure to use based on the
            role-type classification of the two variables. The module emphasized how important it is
            to interpret any observed association in the context of the problem, but
            <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T230450-0400" comment="use italics rather than all caps for emphasis"?>NOT<?oxy_comment_end?>
            to be tempted to interpret association as causation, due to the possible presence of
            lurking variables. You are now ready to practice your knowledge by going through your
            second StatTutor exercise<!--, and then doing a quick checkpoint activity-->.</p>
         <p>One of the first few screens in StatTutor will have a link to download the dataset for
            this StatTutor exercise. When you click that link, a pop-up window will appear asking if
            you want to open or save the file. Make sure you click "Save," which will allow you to
            save the file to your hard drive. Then find the downloaded file and double-click it to
            open it if you're using R, StatCrunch, Minitab, or Excel, or transfer it to your
            calculator if you're using the TI Calculator.</p>

                    objectives for the Examining Relationships module and use the first <em>My

                    material that you would like the instructor to address. Your questions can be
                    for clarification of the material or further insight. Your self-evaluation and
                    questions may also shape the discussions in class.</p>
                <p>Your response will not be graded, but will be available for your instructor to
                    read. Answering these questions may also shape the discussions in class.</p>-->
