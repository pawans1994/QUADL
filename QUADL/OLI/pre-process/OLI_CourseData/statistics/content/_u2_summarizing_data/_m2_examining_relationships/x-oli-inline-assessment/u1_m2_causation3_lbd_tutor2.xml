         <p>What is a likely lurking variable in this case that could explain this observed
            relationship? (Hint: This lurking variable affects both the type of light with which a
            child sleeps and the child's later nearsightedness.)</p>

            <p>A lurking variable that can very likely explain the observed relationship in this
               case is the nearsightedness of the child's parents (one or both). If the parents are
               nearsighted, then their child is more likely to be nearsighted due to genetic
               factors. Also, nearsighted parents are more likely to leave more light near their
               sleeping children to make it easier to care for them at night. Click <link
