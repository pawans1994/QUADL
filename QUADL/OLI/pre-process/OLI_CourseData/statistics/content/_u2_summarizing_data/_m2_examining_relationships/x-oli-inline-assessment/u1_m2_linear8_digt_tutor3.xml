               <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that the slope is the change we would expect in
                  the response variable for every 1-unit increase (or decrease) in the explanatory
                  variable. In this context, which variable is the explanatory variable, and which variable is

            <response match="Res1" score="10">
               <feedback>Correct. The explanatory variable is the bond rate. A negative slope of 491
                  means that for each 1-unit change in the explanatory variable, we would expect the
                  response variable to change by 491 units. Since the slope is negative, the changes
                  are in opposite directions. Thus, if the explanatory variable increases, the
                  response variable decreases, and vice versa.</feedback>
