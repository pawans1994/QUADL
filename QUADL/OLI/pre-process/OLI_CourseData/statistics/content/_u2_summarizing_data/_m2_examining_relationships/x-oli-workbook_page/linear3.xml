<p>Now that we understand the use of
                <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T181428-0400" comment="remove bold -- no emphasis needed"?><em>r</em><?oxy_comment_end?>
            as a numerical measure for assessing the direction and strength of linear relationships
            between quantitative variables, we will
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T181654-0400"?>look
            at<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T181653-0400" content="see"?>
            a few examples. </p>
<example>
<title>Highway Sign Visibility</title>
<p>Earlier, we used the scatterplot below to find a <em>negative linear</em> relationship between the age of a driver and the maximum distance at which a highway sign was legible. What about the strength of the relationship?
It turns out that the correlation between the two variables is r = -0.793. </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/linear3.gif" alt="The scatterplot for highway sign visibility. The
vertical axis is labeled &quot;Sign Legibility Distance (feet)&quot; and the horizontal axis is labeled
&quot;Driver Age (years)&quot;" />
<p>Since r &lt; 0, it confirms that the direction of the relationship is negative (although we
                really didn't need r to tell us that). Since
                    <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T182256-0400" comment="remove bold -- no emphasis needed"?><em>r</em><?oxy_comment_end?>
                is relatively close to -1, it suggests that the relationship is moderately strong.
                In context, the negative correlation confirms that the maximum distance at which a
                sign is legible generally decreases with age. Since the value of r indicates that
                the linear relationship is moderately
                strong<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T182325-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                but not perfect, we can expect the maximum distance to vary
                somewhat<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T182333-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                even among drivers of the same age. </p>

<example>
<title>Statistics Courses</title>
<p>A statistics department is interested in tracking the progress of its students from entry until
                graduation. As part of the study,
                the<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T185502-0400" content="y"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T185503-0400"?>

                students in an introductory course and in an
                upper<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T185526-0400"?>-<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T185526-0400" content=" "?>level
                course required for graduation. What is the relationship between the students'
                course averages in the two courses? Here is the scatterplot for the data: </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/linear4.gif" alt="A scatterplot for the data, in which the
vertical axis is labeled &quot;Upper Level Course Average&quot; and the horizontal axis is labeled
&quot;Introductory Course Average&quot;."/>
<p>The scatterplot suggests a relationship that is <em>positive</em> in direction, <em>linear</em>
                in form, and seems quite strong. The value of the correlation that we find between
                the two variables is
                    <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T185626-0400" comment="remove bold -- no emphasis needed"?><em>r</em><?oxy_comment_end?>
                = 0.931, which is very close to 1, and thus confirms that indeed the linear
                relationship is very strong. </p>

<p>Note that in both examples we supplemented the scatterplot with the correlation
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T185656-0400"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>r<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T185657-0400"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>.
                    Now that we have the correlation
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T185701-0400"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>r<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T185702-0400"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>,
                    why do we still need to look at a scatterplot when examining the relationship
                    between two quantitative variables? </p>
<p>The
                        <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101029T190059-0400" comment="remove all bold; make the word &quot;only&quot; italic"?><em>correlation</em>
                    coefficient can <em>only</em> be interpreted as the <em>measure of the strength
                        of a linear relationship</em><?oxy_comment_end?>, so we need the scatterplot
                    to verify that the relationship indeed looks linear. This point and its
                    importance will be clearer after we examine a few properties of r. </p>
