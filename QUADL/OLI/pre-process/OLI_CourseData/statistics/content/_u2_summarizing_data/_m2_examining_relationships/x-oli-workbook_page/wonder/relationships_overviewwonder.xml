   <question> Is
            <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T111719-0400" content="it always clear what is "?>the
            role classification<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T111725-0400"?>
            of variables always clear<?oxy_insert_end?>? In other words, is it always clear which of
            the variables is the explanatory and which is the response? </question>
<answer>

            There are studies in which the role classification is not really clear. This mainly
            happens in cases when both variables are categorical or both are quantitative. An
            example
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T111835-0400"?>is<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T111833-0400" content="could be"?>
            a study that explores the relationship between
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T111850-0400"?>students'
            <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101020T111849-0400" content="the"?>
            SAT Math and SAT Verbal scores. In cases like this, any classification choice would be
            fine (as long as it is consistent throughout the analysis). </answer>
