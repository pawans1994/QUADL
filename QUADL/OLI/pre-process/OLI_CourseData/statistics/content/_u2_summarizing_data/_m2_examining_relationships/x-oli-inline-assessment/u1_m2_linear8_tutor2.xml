               <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that the slope is the change we would expect in the
                  response variable for every 1-unit increase in the explanatory variable. In this

               <feedback>Correct. The slope is the change we would expect in the response variable
                  for an increase of 1 unit in the explanatory variable. A positive slope of 1.0 for
                  the regression line means that every change of 1 unit in the explanatory variable
                  leads us to expect a change of 1 unit in the response variable.</feedback>
