            <p>A study seeks to answer the question, “Does Vitamin C level in the breast milk of new
                mothers reduce the risk of allergies in their breastfed infants?” The study
                concluded that high levels of vitamin C (measured in mg) were associated with a 30
                percent lower risk of allergies in the infants.</p>
            <p>In this scenario, “levels of vitamin C (measured in milligrams)” is what type of variable?</p>
