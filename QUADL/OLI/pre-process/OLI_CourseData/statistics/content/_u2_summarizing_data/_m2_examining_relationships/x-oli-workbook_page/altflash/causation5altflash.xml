<title>Including a Lurking Variable</title>
<body>
<p>The following scatterplot displays the relationship between the percentage of students taking the
                    SAT and the median SAT<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T220522-0400"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T220522-0400" content="-"?>Math
                    scores in each of the 50
                    U<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T220527-0400"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?>S<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T220528-0400"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    states<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221518-0400"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?></p>
<image style="block" src="../../webcontent/causation12b.gif"/>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the explanatory variable is the
                        percent<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221621-0400"?>age<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        taking the SAT,</li>
<li>the response variable is the median SAT<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221411-0400"?>
                        <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221410-0400" content="-"?>Math
                        score, and</li>
<li><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221422-0400"?>e<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221422-0400" content="E"?>ach
                        data point on the scatterplot represents one of the states, so for example,
                        in Illinois, in the year these data were collected, 16% of the students took
                        the SAT<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221438-0400"?>
                        <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221437-0400" content="-"?>Math,
                        and their median score was 528. </li>
</ul>
<image style="block" src="../../webcontent/causation13.gif"/>
<p>Notice that there is a negative relationship between the percentage of students who take the SAT
                    in a state, and the median SAT<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221709-0400"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221707-0400" content="-"?>Math
                    score in that
                    state<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221901-0400"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T221900-0400" content="!"?>
                    What could the explanation behind this negative trend be? Why might having more
                    people take the test be associated with lower scores?</p>
<image style="block" src="../../webcontent/causation14.gif"/>
<p>Note that another visible feature of the data is the presence of a gap in the middle of the
                    scatterplot, which creates two distinct clusters in the data. This suggests that
                    maybe there is a lurking variable that separates the states into these two
                    clusters, and that including this lurking variable in the study (as we did, by
                    creating this labeled
                    sc<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T222500-0400"?>a<?oxy_insert_end?>tterplot)
                    will help us understand the negative trend.</p>
<image style="block" src="../../webcontent/causation15.gif"/>
<p>It turns out that indeed, the clusters represent two groups of states:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "blue group" on the right represents the states where the SAT is the test of choice for students and colleges.</li>
<li>The "red group" on the left represents the states where the ACT college entrance examination is commonly used.</li>
</ul>
<image style="block" src="../../webcontent/causation16.gif"/>
<p>It makes sense then, that in the "ACT states" on the left, a smaller percentage of students take
                    the SAT. Moreover,
                    th<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T222116-0400" content="os"?>e
                    students who do take the SAT in the ACT states are probably
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T222123-0400" content="those "?>students
                    who are applying to more prestigious national colleges, and therefore represent
                    a more select group of students. This is the reason why we see high SAT<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T222322-0400"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T222321-0400" content="-m"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T222326-0400"?>M<?oxy_insert_end?>ath
                    scores in this group.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the "SAT states" on the right, larger percentages of students take the
                    test. These students represent a much broader cross-section of the population,
                    and therefore we see lower (more
                    average<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T222413-0400" content="-like"?>) SAT<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T222417-0400"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101101T222417-0400" content="-"?>Math
                    scores.</p>
<p>
<em>To summarize:</em>
In this case, including the lurking variable "ACT state" versus "SAT state" helped us better
understand the observed negative relationship in our data.</p>
