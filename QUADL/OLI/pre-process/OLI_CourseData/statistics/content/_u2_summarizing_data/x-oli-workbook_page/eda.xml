First, a set of data was created from a subset of the population. Then, we perform step 2, exploratory data analysis on the data. This is the step we are working on in this unit. With the analysis results, we apply the third step, probability to help us draw conclusions about the population from the data. Next, we perform inference and draw conclusions.
