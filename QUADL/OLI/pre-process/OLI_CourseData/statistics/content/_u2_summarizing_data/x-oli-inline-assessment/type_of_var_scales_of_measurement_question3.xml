            <body>Which of the following is an interval scale of measurement?</body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="true" select="single">
                <choice value="A">Amount of Monthly Mortgage Payment</choice>
                <choice value="B">Political Affiliation (i.e., Democrat, Republican, Independent)</choice>
                <choice value="C">Intelligence (IQ) Scores</choice>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that interval measurement does not have a meaningful zero.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that interval measurement takes a meaningful numerical form with the distance between numbers assumed to be equal.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. Intelligence scores are interval level of measurement, because they take numerical form and the distance between pairs of scores are assumed to be equal, but there is no meaningful zero point; that is, there cannot be a complete absence of intelligence.</feedback>
                </response>
                <hint>Remember, an interval measurement takes numerical form, where the distance between pairs of consecutive numbers are assumed to be equal, but it does not have a meaningful zero.</hint>
