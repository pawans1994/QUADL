            <body>Which of the following is a ratio scale of measurement?</body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="true" select="single">
                <choice value="A">Social Security Numbers</choice>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that a ratio variable uses numbers to represent the amount of a characteristic and zero represents the absence of the characteristic.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. Length of room in inches is a ratio variable because it uses numbers to represent the amount of a characteristic and it has a meaningful zero.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that a ratio variable uses numbers to represent the amount of a characteristic and zero represents the absence of the characteristic.</feedback>
                </response>
                <hint>Remember, a ratio measurement takes numerical form, where the distance between pairs of consecutive numbers are assumed to be equal and zero means the absence of the characteristic.</hint>
