                <feedback>Incorrect. Hospt is not a quantitative variable. Rather, it is a
                    categorical variable because the numbers represent codes, which are used to
                    identify individual hospitals and place them into categories. As such, the
                    numbers used for the codes (1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) have no arithmetic
                    meaning.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. You are correct that Time is a quantitative variable, since it
                    can take on multiple numerical values, which have arithmetic meaning (i.e., it
                    makes sense to add, subtract, multiply, divide, or compare the magnitude of such
                    values). However, there is at least one other variable that is also
                    quantitative.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. You are correct that Age is a quantitative variable, since it
                    can take on multiple numerical values, which represent a characteristic of the
                    patient; in addition, these values have arithmetic meaning (i.e., it makes sense

                <feedback>Incorrect. Gender is not a quantitative variable. Rather, it is a

                    Female and Male. Thus, the numbers used to represent gender (1 = Female; 2 =
                    Male) have no arithmetic meaning.</feedback>
