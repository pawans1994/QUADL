            <body>A researcher observes Teacher Aâ€™s classroom of 30 students for a 45-minute class.
                The researcher records the percentage of time students spend working in groups
                during the class. What scale of measurement is this measure?</body>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. This measure does not assign values and individuals to
                        discrete categories. This measurement represents an amount of time, and zero
                        means the absence of the variable.</feedback>

                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Ordinal scales of measurement use rank ordering. This
                        measurement represents an amount of time, and zero means the absence of the
                        variable.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Interval scales of measurement use numbers to represent the
                        amount of a characteristic that a subject has and have an arbitrary zero
                        point. This measurement represents an amount of time, and zero means the
                        absence of the variable.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="D" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. Ratio variables use numbers to represent the amount of a
                        characteristic, where zero means the absence of the characteristic. In this
                        case, the measure of time represents the proportion of the class that is
                        group work, where zero means they do not do any group work in this 45-minute
                        period.</feedback>
