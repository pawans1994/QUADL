            <body>Scores on the SAT Math Test (note: the scores on the SAT Math Test range from 200
                to 800). What scale of measurement is this measure?</body>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. This measure does not assign values and individuals to
                        discrete categories. The measurement is a continuous scale where there is no
                        meaningful zero point.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Ordinal scales of measurement use rank ordering. This
                        measurement is a continuous scale where there is no meaningful zero point.
                    </feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. Interval scales of measurement use numbers to represent the
                        amount of a characteristic that a subject has, but do not have a meaningful
                        zero point. Here, a higher SAT Math Test score indicates greater levels of
                        understanding of mathematical concepts.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="D" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Like a ratio scale of measurement, this measure uses
                        numbers to represent the amount of a characteristic that a subject has, but
                        in ratio scales of measurement zero means the subject does not have the
                        characteristic. In this case, there is no meaningful zero point.</feedback>
