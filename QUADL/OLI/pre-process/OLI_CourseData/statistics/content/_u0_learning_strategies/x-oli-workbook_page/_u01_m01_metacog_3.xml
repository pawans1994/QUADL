                    these two Learn By Doing activities. Read each of the scenarios below and
                    identify which metacognitive skill the student is struggling with. If you need
                    help, remember that you can ask for a hint.</p>

        <p>Strong metacognitive skills are essential for independent learning, so use the experience
            of monitoring your own learning in OLI Statistics as an opportunity to hone these skills
            for other classes and tasks.</p>
