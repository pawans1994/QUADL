            <body>Penelope has worked her way through the entire OLI Statistics course by skipping the text
                and jumping straight to the activities, which she enjoys. When she doesn’t get an
                answer right on one of the activities, she tries the other answers until she
                discovers the correct one. Unfortunately, she does not pass the final exam and has
                to retake it. “Oh well,” she sighs. “Back to the drawing board.” Once again, she
                opens the first unit, skips the text, and goes straight to the activities. Penelope
                has failed to <input_ref input="ans2"/></body>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. From the story, we can’t really know whether Penelope
                        assessed the task inaccurately. What we do know is that she neither learned
                        from her experience nor adjusted her approach the second time
                        around.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. This is possible, but not the best answer. It's true that
                        if Penelope had accurately assessed her strengths and weaknesses the first
                        time she worked through the course, she would have realized that she could
                        not pass the final exam without reading the explanatory text. However, it
                        was her failure to adjust her approach the second time that stands out
                        here.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. This is true, but not the best answer. Penelope did not
                        plan an effective strategy for working through the OLI Statistics course the
                        first time. However, an even bigger mistake was not reflecting on and
                        adjusting her approach after it failed.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="D" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. While Penelope clearly did not monitor her performance
                        closely enough to know her initial approach to studying was not effective,
                        her bigger mistake was to employ the same approach the second time around.
                    </feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="E" score="1">
                    <feedback>Correct. This is the best answer. Penelope is employing the same
                        unsuccessful approach to prepare for the final exam the second time, without
                        learning from her mistakes the first time.</feedback>

                <hint>Look back at the definition for each skill outlined in the section on Metacognition to see if one looks like a match.</hint>
                <hint>Notice that Penelope’s key decision point now is whether or not she will learn
                    from her past mistakes and find a more effective way to go through the unit so
                    she can learn the material.</hint>
