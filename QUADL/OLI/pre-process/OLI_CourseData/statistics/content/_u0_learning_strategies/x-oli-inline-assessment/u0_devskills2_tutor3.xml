            <body>Margot doesn’t give much thought to how she approaches OLI Statistics; she just
                goes to a unit, tries a few activities, then does the Checkpoint. Sometimes she does
                well, sometimes she doesn’t. She’s really not sure how she’ll do on the final exam.

                    <feedback>Correct. Margot hasn't assessed the task at all.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="1">
                    <feedback>Correct. Margot has not bothered to evaluate her own strengths and
                        weaknesses. </feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="1">
                    <feedback>Correct. Margot doesn’t really have a strategy; she’s just trying
                        things without giving her approach much thought.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="D" score="1">
                    <feedback>Correct. Margot isn’t monitoring her own performance, which is why she
                        has no idea what is and isn’t working, or how prepared she is for the final
                        exam.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="E" score="1">
                    <feedback>Correct. By failing to monitor her performance throughout the course,
                        Margot has denied herself the opportunity to reflect on and adjust her
                        approach.</feedback>
