If Joe has some previous experience with statistics, this may be the most efficient and effective strategy for him. The good thing about this strategy is that Joe uses the activities as a way to assess his own capabilities and then adjusts his approach accordingly. Moreover, by deciding to go back to read the preceding text, Joe is giving himself a chance to practice independent learning.</p></feedback></response><response match="no" score="0"><feedback><p id="c99a481dfd7d46599af3029227042298">Not quite right.
