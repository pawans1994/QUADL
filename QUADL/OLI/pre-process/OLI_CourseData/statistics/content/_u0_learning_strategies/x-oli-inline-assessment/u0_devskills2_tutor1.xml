            <body>Rudolfo anticipates a very busy semester, so he completes the entire
              statistics course in the first month of the semester, passing each Checkpoint
                easily. While this frees up his time for other courses, he finds that when he goes
                to take the final exam a few months later, he has forgotten a lot of what he
                learned. Rudolfo failed to <input_ref input="ans"/>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Rudolfo successfully completed the work, so apparently he
                        assessed the task accurately. It was his plan to complete the work too far
                        in advance of the final exam that proved to be ineffective.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. It's possible that Rudolfo overestimated his ability to
                        remember material he had studied weeks earlier. However, it was primarily
                        his plan to complete the work so far in advance of the final exam that
                        proved ineffective. </feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="1">
                    <feedback>Correct. Rudolfo’s plan to complete the work so far in advance of the
                        final exam proved ineffective. Because he left five weeks between studying and
                        taking the final exam, the material was not fresh in his mind when he took
                        the final.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="D" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Rudolfo’s performance throughout the course was fine, so
                        monitoring his performance was not his problem. It was his plan to complete
                        the work too far in advance of the final exam that proved to be ineffective. </feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="E" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. By the time Rudolfo realized his approach was unsuccessful,
                        it was too late to adjust. This was because his plan to complete the work
                        too far in advance of the final exam proved to be ineffective.</feedback>

                <hint>Look back at the definition for each skill outlined in the section on
                    Metacognition to see if one looks like a match.</hint>
                <hint>Consider, for example, that Rudolfo would have been better prepared for the
                    final exam if he had scheduled regular work on the OLI Statistics course
                    throughout the semester.</hint>
