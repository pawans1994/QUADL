For some of you, this material may be part of a hybrid learning experience in which you also meet face-to-face with an instructor. Some of you may be taking this course solely online, with a lot, a little, or no interaction with an instructor. We discuss learning strategies for these different types of learning environments and give you some pointers for using this material to support your learning.</p><p id="c1749faca6454c078ecbc9dd1ca0243a">We then discuss what statistics is all about—the &quot;Big Picture&quot; of statistics—and look at how the four steps in the Big Picture connect to the modules in the Probability and Statistics course.</p></body></workbook_page>
