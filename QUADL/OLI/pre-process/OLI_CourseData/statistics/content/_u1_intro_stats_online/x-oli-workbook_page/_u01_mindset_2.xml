			<title>Learning to Think in a New Way by Rewiring the Brain </title>
			<body>
				<p>This course asks you to do less calculating and more thinking, reading, and
					writing about ideas. Many people find this way of learning statistics difficult at
					first, but that’s normal and expected. Learning to think in a whole new way is
					challenging for everyone, and learning to think in a <em style="italic">statistical</em>
					way is exactly what this class is about. </p>
				<p>When students find out that the goal of this class is to learn to think
					statistically, some worry that they will have to work harder in order to pass.
					And they probably <em style="italic">will</em> have to work harder, at least until they learn the right
					strategies for succeeding in this class. Other students have a different kind of
					worry. They worry that they won't <em style="italic">ever</em> be able to succeed in the class because
					they're "not a math person."</p>
				<p>Fortunately, scientific research shows that the brain literally changes and
					adapts when we practice new ways of thinking. It shows that <em style="italic">everyone</em> can learn
					to think in new ways and can strengthen their brains. It also reveals some of the
					specific strategies that you can use in this course.</p>

					<title>The Brain Gets Stronger</title>
					<body>
						<p>Everyone knows that when you lift weights, you get stronger. A person who
							can’t lift 20 pounds can become strong enough to lift 100 pounds after
							working out for a long time. That's because muscles become larger and
							stronger with exercise. When you stop exercising, your muscles shrink
							and you get weaker. As the saying goes: "Use it or lose
							it!"</p>
						<p>Most people don't know that when they practice and learn new things,
							parts of the brain change and become stronger, a lot like muscles do.
							This is true for babies, teenagers, and adults. <em style="bold"
								>Everyone can improve their abilities significantly as long as they
								practice and use good strategies.</em>

					<title>Intelligence Is about Connections</title>
					<body>
						<p>The outside layer of the brain is made up of billions of nerve cells
							called neurons. These cells connect to each other in a complex network,
							and communication between neurons is what enables us to think and
							solve problems. </p>
						<p>When you learn new things, the connections between these neurons actually
							multiply and get stronger. The more you challenge your mind to learn,
							the more your brain cells connect to each other and the stronger those
							connections become. </p>
						<p>Therefore, tasks that once seemed hard or even impossible, such as doing
							statistics or becoming a good writer, become easier. The result is a
							stronger, smarter brain.</p>

					<title>Using Good Strategies</title>
					<body>
						<p><Research
							shows that the most effective study strategies often feel "harder" than
							less effective strategies because the brain has to be challenged
							in order to become stronger. For example, studies show that
							people learn things best when they quiz themselves or try to remember
							course material <em style="italic">without</em> looking at their book.
							Interestingly, this strategy works well even when you don't yet know the
							answers. When your brain struggles to think of something you <em
								style="italic">don't</em> know, brain cells reach out to form new
							connections. When you see the material later, your brain has already
							prepared itself to absorb the new information.</p>
						<p>When students use this strategy, they sometimes feel they aren't learning
							because they can't yet remember new information well.
							Sometimes, they get frustrated and give up because
							it is easier to reread the
							information than to struggle to recall it. What they don't realize is
							that the experience of struggling to learn is exactly what forms
							stronger new brain connections. The feeling of struggling is a normal
							side effect of how your brain grows when it learns things.</p>
						<p>Think about it this way: strategies that feel easy, such as rereading a
							textbook, are kind of like going to the gym and lifting balloons instead
							of weights. Even if you spend a lot of time doing it, you won't get
							stronger. The harder strategies are like real weights—they're a lot
							harder to lift, and it might feel like you're struggling—but they pay
							off.</p>
