Does eating fat cause cancer? Does vitamin C prevent colds? Can you predict someone's 
University grades from their SAT scores? Are the smoking habits of parents and their children related?
</p>


<p>Statistics can help us answer all these questions. Broadly speaking, 
Statistics is a set of methods that help us collect, organize and interpret data. We 
use these tools to uncover relationships between variables, to make predictions and to 
discover causal mechanisms. 
</p>

<p>The aim of this course is to help you become statistically literate. You will learn the basic concepts of statistics, 
so that you will be equipped to read a newspaper and know when the quantitative information being presented is accurate or 
misleading. You will also learn about organizing and displaying graphical and numerical summaries of data, and drawing 
conclusions from them.
</p>


<p>The way introductory statistics courses are taught has changed tremendously in the last 10 years. Instead of tedious 
arithmetic calculations, we will emphasize: 
</p>


<ul class="lowerroman">
<li>graphical analysis of data 
<li>simple but powerful concepts that do not require difficult mathematical manipulations, and 
<li>interpretation of computer output 
</ul>




<p>
<em class="sectiontitle">Concepts:</em><br>The main concepts you will learn about in this course are: 
</p>

<ul class="lowerroman">
<li><u>Exploratory Data Analysis:</u> A data set consists of a collection of measurements. How can we organize them and describe them? How can we gain insight by exploring the data visually. 
<li><u>Experimental Design:</u> A newspaper article reports that according to a recent study, people who eat lots of oat bran have fewer heart attacks. How was this study designed? Was it designed in a way that we can conclude from it that eating oat bran actually prevents heart attacks? In general, when can we be sure that when the results of a study show that two phenomena are associated, that one actually "causes" the other? 
<li><u>Sampling Variability:</u> Even if we know we are measuring a fixed quantity--like the length of a tabletop, the speed of light, or the fraction of people who support health care reform--repeated measurements will vary somewhat. Why is this? How much variability can we expect? Does the variability mean we can never tell what the right answer is? 
<li><u>Statistical Inference:</u> It is rarely feasible to measure everyone in the population. At best, we can draw a random sample from the population. How can we make inferences about the population based on the sample? polls do this everyday. How do they do it? 
<li><u>Probability:</u> Probability is a mathematical description of randomness, and provides us with the formalisms that allow us to draw inferences from samples to populations. In addition, the study of probability theory provides new perspectives, methodologies, models and intuitions to aid in the analysis and solution of real world problems.
