<p>Obviously, sampling is not done for its own sake. After this first stage in the data production
                    process is completed, we come to the second stage, that of gaining information
                    about the variables of interest from the sampled individuals. In this module
                    we'll discuss three study
                    designs<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T105436-0400"?>;
                    each design enables you to determine the values of the variables in a different
                    way<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T105456-0400" content=" via which the variables&apos; values may be assessed:"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T105502-0400"?>.

<p>The type of design used, and the details of the design, are crucial, since they will determine
                    what kind of conclusions we may draw from the results. In particular, when
                    studying relationships in the Exploratory Data Analysis unit, we stressed that
                    an association between two variables does not guarantee that a causal
                    relationship exists. In this module, we will explore how
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110158-0400"?>the<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110156-0400" content="various"?>
                    details of a study design play a crucial role in
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110210-0400"?>determining
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>our ability to establish evidence of causation.</p>
<p>
<em>Here is how this module is organized:</em>
</p>
<p>We'll start this module by learning how to identify
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110254-0400" content="the"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110257-0400"?>study<?oxy_insert_end?> type<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110300-0400"?>s.<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110305-0400" content="of study and, i"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110332-0400"?>I<?oxy_insert_end?>n
                    particular,
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110340-0400"?>we will
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>highlight the distinction between observational studies and
                    experiments.</p>
<p>We will then
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110357-0400"?>discuss<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110354-0400" content="talk separately about"?>
                    each of the three
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110416-0400" content="types of "?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110405-0400"?>study
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>designs mentioned above.</p>
<ul>
<li>We'll discuss observational studies, focusing on why it is difficult to establish causation in these type of studies, as well as other possible flaws.</li>
<li>We'll then focus on
                        experiments<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110503-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        learning<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110551-0400"?>,
                        among other things,<?oxy_insert_end?> that when appropriately designed,
                        experiments
                            <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110614-0400" comment="use italics instead of bold for emphasis"?><em>can
                        </em><?oxy_comment_end?>provide evidence of
                        causation<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T110527-0400" content=", and discuss other topics related to experiments"?>.</li>
<li>We'll end the module by discussing surveys and sample size.</li>
