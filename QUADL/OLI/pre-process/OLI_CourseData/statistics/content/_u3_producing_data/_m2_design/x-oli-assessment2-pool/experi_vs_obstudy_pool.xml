            <p>In order to determine the effect companion animals might have on the moods of elderly
                people living alone experimenters created six groups from a large population of
                single people over 70 years old. They had three groups: those without pets, those
                who owned a dog, and those who owned a cat. They randomly selected 50 men from each
                of those groups and 50 women from each of those groups for a total of 300
                participants. Which of the following statements about this study is correct? </p>

            <p>It is known that, in the United States, well-educated people are less likely to smoke.
                But what about other nations, where there may be different cultures and/or attitudes

                in France, a random sample of 334 French men was classified according to their
                education level (elementary, high-school, or university) and their smoking habits
