            <p>In a study, which of the following is the <em style="bold">most important</em> reason to use random
                allocation of subjects to the different treatments?</p>
        </body>
        <input labels="false" shuffle="true">
            <choice value="A">To ensure that each subject in the trial receives the best possible
                treatment</choice>
            <choice value="B">To guarantee that approximately the same number of subjects is
                assigned to each treatment group</choice>
            <choice value="C">To protect the experimenters from legal action in the event that the
                experiment goes drastically awry</choice>
            <choice value="D">To ensure that the different treatment groups are as similar as
                possible in every way <em>except</em> for the treatment received</choice>
            <choice value="E">To guarantee that the results of the experiment can never be
                duplicated</choice>

        <part>
            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that "treatments" in a study don’t necessarily refer
                    to making the subjects "better," and random allocation wouldn’t ensure that
                    anyway. <!--Think about the other choices.--></feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Although it’s true that random allocation would ensure roughly
                    the same number of subjects per treatment group, that’s not the most
                    important reason for the random allocation.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Random allocation in a study is important for a reason
                    involving the interpretation of the results, not for legal protection; and
                    random allocation wouldn’t ensure legal protection, anyway.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="D" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. By ensuring that the treatment groups are as similar in every
                    possible way except for the imposed treatment, random allocation <em style="italic">eliminates
                        lurking variables</em>and thus allows conclusions of <em style="italic">causation</em>.
                </feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="E" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Random allocation doesn’t prevent the experimental results from
                    being replicated by other researchers. If it did, we wouldn’t do it, since
                    replication is important to verify experimental results.</feedback>
