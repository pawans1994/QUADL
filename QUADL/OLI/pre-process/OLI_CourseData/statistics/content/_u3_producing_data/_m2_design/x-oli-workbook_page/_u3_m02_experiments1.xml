                One Explanatory Variable</title>
<body>
<p>It is not uncommon for experiments to feature two or more explanatory variables (called factors).
                    In this course, we focus on exploratory data analysis and statistical inference
                    in situations which involve only one explanatory variable. Nevertheless, we will
                    now consider the design for experiments involving several
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T202814-0400"?>explanatory
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>variables, in order to familiarize students with their basic
                    structure.</p>
<example>

<p>Suppose researchers are not only interested in the effect of diet on blood pressure, but also the
                        effect of two new drugs. Subjects are assigned to either Control Diet (no
                        restrictions), Diet #1, or Diet #2, (the variable diet has,
                        then<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T202847-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>

                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T202919-0400"?>and
                        <?oxy_insert_end?>are also assigned to receive either Placebo, Drug #1, or
                        Drug #2 (the variable Drug,
                        then<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T202930-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        also has three values). This is an example where the experiment has two
                        explanatory
                        variable<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T202938-0400"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        and a response variable. In order to set up such an
                        experiment<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T203023-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        there has to be <em>one treatment group for every combination of categories
                            of the two explanatory variables</em>. Thus, in this case there are 3<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T203120-0400"?>
                        <?oxy_insert_end?>*<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T203120-0400"?>

                        <?oxy_insert_end?>9 combinations of the two variables to which the subjects
                        are assigned. The treatment groups are illustrated and labeled in the
                        following table: </p>
<!--:WARNING: Removed paragraph enclosing image element.--><image style="block" src="../webcontent/image009.gif"
alt="The column headings for the table are for the Diet variable: &quot;No-diet&quot;,
&quot;Special diet 1&quot; and &quot;Special diet 2.&quot; The Rows are for the drug
variable: &quot;Placebo,&quot; &quot;Drug 1,&quot; and &quot;Drug 2.&quot; There are 9
cells in the table, one for every possible combination of row and column. These cells
are labeled &quot;tttX&quot;, where X is in the range of [1-9], representing each
combination."/>
<p>Subjects would be randomly assigned to one of the nine treatment groups. If we find differences
                        in the proportions of subjects who achieve the lower "moderate zone" blood
                        pressure among the nine treatment groups, then we have evidence that the
                        diet<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T203234-0400"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        and/or drugs may be effective for reducing blood pressure.</p>

<p>1. Recall that randomization may be employed at two stages of an experiment: in the selection of
                    subjects, and in the assignment of treatments. The former may be helpful in
                    allowing us to generalize what occurs
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T203332-0400"?>among<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T203331-0400" content="for"?>
                    our subjects to what would occur in the general population, but the reality of
                    most experimental settings is that a convenience or volunteer sample is used.
                    Most likely the blood pressure study described above would use volunteer
                    subjects. The important thing is to make sure these subjects are randomly
                    assigned to one of the nine treatment combinations.</p>
<p>2. In order to gain optimal information about individuals in all the various treatment groups, we
                    would like to make assignments not just randomly, but also evenly. If there are
                    90 subjects in the blood pressure study described above, and 9 possible
                    treatment groups, then each group should be filled randomly
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T203431-0400"?>with<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T203430-0400" content="by"?>
                    10 individuals. A simple random sample of 10 could be taken from the larger
                    group of 90, and those individuals would be assigned to the first treatment
                    group. Next, the second treatment
                    group<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T203458-0400" content="s"?>
                    would be filled by a simple random sample of 10 taken from the remaining 80
                    subjects. This process would be repeated until all 9 groups are filled with 10
                    individuals each.</p>

        <body> <p>A university was interested in examining the overall effectiveness of its online statistics
                            course, along with the effectiveness of particular aspects of the
                            course. First, the university wanted to see whether the online course
                            was better than a standard course. Second, the university wanted to know
                            whether students learned best using Excel, using Minitab, or using no
