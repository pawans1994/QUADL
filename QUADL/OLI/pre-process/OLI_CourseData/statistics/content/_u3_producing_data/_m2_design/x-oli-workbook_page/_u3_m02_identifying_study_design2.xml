<title>Experiments vs. Observational Studies</title>

<p>Before assessing the effectiveness of observational studies and experiments for producing
                    evidence of a causal relationship between two variables, we
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T115306-0400"?>will
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>illustrate the essential

                occur naturally. In this

                a method of trying to quit smoking. In an experiment, researchers assign
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T120708-0400"?>the
                <?oxy_insert_end?>values of the explanatory variable. In other words, they tell
                people what method to use. Let us consider how we might compare the four techniques,
                via either an observational study or an experiment.</p>
<p>1. An <em>observational study</em> of the relationship between these two variables requires us to
                collect a representative sample from the population of smokers who are
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T120826-0400" content="just now "?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T120921-0400"?>beginning

                to quit. We can imagine that a substantial proportion of
                th<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T120840-0400"?>at<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T120840-0400" content="e"?>
                population is trying one of the four
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T120847-0400"?>above
                <?oxy_insert_end?>methods. In order to obtain a representative sample, we might use
                a nationwide telephone survey to identify
                1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T120900-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>000
                smokers <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T120904-0400"?>who are
                <?oxy_insert_end?>just<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T120945-0400" content=" now"?>
                beginning to quit smoking. We record which of the four methods the smokers use. One
                year later, we contact the same
                1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T120957-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>000
                individuals and determine
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121003-0400"?>whether
                they<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121007-0400" content="whose attempts"?>
                succeeded.</p>
<p>2. In an <em>experiment</em>, we again collect a representative sample from the population of
                smokers who are just now trying to quit, using a nationwide telephone survey of
                1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121047-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>000
                individuals. This time, however, we divide the sample into 4 groups of 250 and
                    <em>as<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121057-0400" content="s"?>sign</em>
                each group to use one of the four methods to quit. One year later, we contact the
                same
                1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121113-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>000
                individuals and determine whose attempts succeeded while using our designated
                method. </p>
</example>
<p>The following figures illustrate the two study designs:</p>
<p>1. Observational study:</p>
<!--:WARNING: Removed paragraph enclosing image element.--><image style="block" src="../webcontent/image001.gif"
    alt="A visual representation of the Observational Study. A large circle represents the entire
 population. Through random selection we generate the sample, which is represented as a smaller
 circle. The circle representing the samples is divided up unevenly into 4 pieces, each piece
 representing one value of the explanatory variable (method), which have been &quot;Self-
 Assigned&quot; by the people in the sample."/>
<p>2. Experiment:</p>
<!--:WARNING: Removed paragraph enclosing image element.--><image style="block" src="../webcontent/image002.gif"
        alt="A visual representation of the Experimental Study. A large circle represents the entire
population. Through random selection we generate the sample, which is represented as a smaller
circle. The circle representing the samples is divided up evenly into 4 pieces, each piece
representing one value of the explanatory variable (method), which have been assigned by the
researchers."/>
<p>Both the observational study and the experiment begin with a random sample from the population of
            smokers just now beginning to quit. In both cases, the individuals in the sample can be
            divided into categories based on the values of the explanatory variable: method used to
            quit. The response variable is success or failure after one year. Finally, in both
            cases, we would assess the relationship
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121455-0400"?>between the
            variables <?oxy_insert_end?>by comparing the proportions of success
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121419-0400"?>of<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121417-0400" content="among"?>
            the individuals using each method, using a two-way table and conditional
            percentages.</p>
<p>The only difference between the two methods is the way the sample is divided into categories for
            the explanatory variable (method). In the observational study, individuals are divided
            based upon the method
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121628-0400"?>by<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121626-0400" content="with"?>
            which they
                <em><?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121723-0400" comment="use italics for emphasis rather than bold"?>choose</em><?oxy_comment_end?>
            to quit smoking. The researcher does not assign
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121645-0400"?>the
            <?oxy_insert_end?>values of the explanatory variable, but
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121736-0400"?>rather
            <?oxy_insert_end?>records them as they naturally occur. In the experiment, the
            researcher <em>deliberately assigns</em>
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121838-0400"?>one of the four
            methods to <?oxy_insert_end?>each individual in the
            sample<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121848-0400" content=" to one of the four methods"?>.
            The researcher intervenes
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121903-0400"?>by<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121902-0400" content="or"?>
            control<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121907-0400"?>ling<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121907-0400" content="s"?>
            the explanatory
            variable<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121914-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            and <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121917-0400" content="only "?>then
            assesses its relationship with the response variable. </p>
<p>Now that we have outlined two possible study designs,
            let<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121928-0400"?>'<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T121929-0400" content=" u"?>s
            return to the original question: which of the four methods for quitting smoking is most
            successful? Suppose

            study's results indicate that individuals who try to quit with the combination
            drug/therapy method have the highest rate of success, and those who try to quit
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T122114-0400"?><?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T122256-0400" comment="Suggest changing graphic below to read &quot;nether drugs nor therapy&quot; rather than &quot;cold turkey&quot;"?>with
