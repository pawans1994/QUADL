            <p>A simple random sample of 1,110 adult Americans is selected, and each person is asked
                the following question: </p>
            <p><em style="italic">In light of the huge national deficit, should the government at
                    this time spend additional money to establish a national system of health
                    insurance?</em></p>
            <p>Only 39% of respondents answered yes. Which of the following is an appropriate
                conclusion about the results of this summary?</p>
