            <p><em>Research Question: </em>What is the combined effect of medication and diet on
                blood pressure in adult males?</p>
            <p>A randomized, controlled experiment investigated this question using a random sample
                of 540 adult males as subjects. At the beginning of the study, researchers measured
                the blood pressure of all the subjects. Each subject was given a month's supply of
                either Drug A, Drug B, or a placebo, then was assigned to be on either a low-fat
                diet or a low-salt diet for that month-long period. At the end of the month, the
                researchers measured the blood pressure of each subject again, and compared the two
                blood pressure readings. </p>
