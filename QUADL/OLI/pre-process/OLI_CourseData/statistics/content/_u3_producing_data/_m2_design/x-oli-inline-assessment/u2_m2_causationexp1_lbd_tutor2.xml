         <p>Based on your answer to the question above, does the randomization allow us to study the differences in user preferences between the three browsers, while eliminating the possible effects of the lurking variables age, gender, and hours per week of computer use?  Comment below:</p>

            <p>Our results suggest that the distributions
               <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T165058-0400"?>of
               <?oxy_insert_end?>age, gender, and hours per week of computer use among the three
               treatments are about the same; therefore, the randomization was successful in
               balancing these three potential lurking variables among the three treatment groups.
               We can be fairly sure that any difference between the treatment groups that we find
               on the user tests of the software will be due to differences in the three software
               versions, rather than the lurking variables of age, gender, and hours per week of
               computer use.</p>
