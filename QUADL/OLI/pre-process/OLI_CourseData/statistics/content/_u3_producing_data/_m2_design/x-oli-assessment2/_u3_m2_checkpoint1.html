			<p> It is known that in the United States, well-educated people are less likely to

			<p> For their 1992 study &#x201C;The Effect of Country Music on Suicide&#x201D;
				(published in <em style="italic">Social Forces</em>, vol. 71, p. 211), researchers
				Stack and Gundlach investigated various American communities, recording the number
