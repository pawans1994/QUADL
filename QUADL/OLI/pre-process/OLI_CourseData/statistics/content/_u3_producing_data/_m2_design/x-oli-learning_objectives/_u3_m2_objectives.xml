How a study can be biased was discussed, but generally in mainstream media, you don&apos;t get to see the details of the study design, or the survey questions, etc., so there would be no way to know if the study was biased in those ways just from reading an article in Time magazine about a study. 

I think that in order to include this as an objective, there should be a specific discussion about what to be &quot;suspicious of&quot; in the media, and how to do further research to determine a study&apos;s validity and lack of bias before believing it."?>Critically
        evaluate the reliability and validity of results published in mainstream media.
