            <p>In a study conducted by Frantzen and colleagues from 2001 through 2004, researchers
                studied the consumption of ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) with the body mass index (BMI)
                of 625 low-income minority fourth- to sixth-grade students living in San Antonio,
                Texas. (Students were randomly selected.) They measured students’ age, ethnicity,
                height, and weight and students were administered dietary interviews at the
                beginning of their fourth-grade year and the end of their fifth- and sixth-grade
                years. They found a “significant inverse relation between the BMI percentile and the
                frequency of RTEC consumption” and concluded that “children who frequently consumed
                RTEC had greater intakes of essential nutrients at baseline and significantly lower
                BMI over a 3-year period.” </p>
            <p>Is it safe for us to conclude that there is a causal relationship between regular
                consumption of RTEC and the drop in BMI? </p>

            <p>For their 1992 study, "The Effect of Country Music on Suicide"
                (published in <em style="italic">Social Forces</em>, vol. 71, p. 211), researchers
                Stack and Gundlach investigated various American communities, recording the number
                of minutes of daily radio airtime devoted to country songs and the suicide rate.
                They found a moderately strong positive correlation. </p>
            <p>In their paper, the researchers explain the results by saying that
                "the themes found in country music <em style="italic">foster</em> a suicidal mood" (emphasis added). A news
                headline (<em style="italic">The Independent</em> [London], October 1, 2004, p. 15) about the research
                echoed these sentiments when it said, "Strange But True: Country Music Saps
                Will to Live." The research is even cited on various suicide-prevention
                websites, some with headings such as "Country Music Increases Suicide
                Risk." </p>
            <p>Based on this study, can we have confidence in causality between country music and
                suicide? </p>
        </body>
        <input labels="false" shuffle="true">
            <choice value="A">Yes, as long as the communities were sampled randomly,
                and the number of communities (the sample size) was sufficiently large. </choice>
            <choice value="B">Yes, causality is indicated by the moderately strong
                correlation. </choice>
            <choice value="C">Yes, since different communities listened to different
                levels of country music, meaningful experimental comparisons can be made. </choice>
            <choice value="D">No, because the lack of assignment of communities to
                different levels of country music listening means there is a possibility of lurking
                variables. </choice>
            <choice value="E">No, causality can be demonstrated only by investigating
                the entire population. </choice>

        <part>
            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The <em>sampling</em> method only determines whether the
                    relationship seen in the study can be generalized to the population (within the
                    uncertainty of natural variability), but not whether the relationship
                    demonstrates causation or merely association. The sample <em>size</em> only
                    helps to determine the uncertainty due to natural variability, but not whether
                    the relationship demonstrates causation.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The correlation only measures the strength of the relationship,
                    but it doesn’t indicate whether the relationship demonstrates
                    causation.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Only <em>experiments</em> can determine causation, but it’s not
                    merely having comparisons that makes something an <em>experiment</em>. There can
                    be comparisons in observational studies, too.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="D" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. <em>Causation</em> can only be determined if the <em>explanatory
                    variable is randomly assigned</em>. But in this case, the researchers didn’t
                    randomly assign different amounts of country music to be played in different
                    communities. So the study design doesn’t rule out lurking variables.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="E" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The entire population doesn’t need to be investigated to
                    determine causation. A relationship can be determined to be causative based on
                    the study design.</feedback>
