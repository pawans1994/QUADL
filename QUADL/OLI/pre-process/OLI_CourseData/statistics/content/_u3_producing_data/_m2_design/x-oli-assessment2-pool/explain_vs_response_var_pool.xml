            <p><em style="bold">Research Question: </em>What is the combined effect of medication
                and diet on blood pressure in adult males?</p>
            <p>A randomized, controlled experiment investigated this question using a random sample
                of 540 adult males as subjects. At the beginning of the study, researchers measured
                the blood pressure of all the subjects. Each subject was given a month's supply of
                either Drug A, Drug B, or a placebo, then was assigned to be on either a low-fat
                diet or a low-salt diet for that month-long period. At the end of the month, the
                researchers measured the blood pressure of each subject again, and compared the two
                blood pressure readings. </p>
            <p>Which of the following is an explanatory variable in this study? Check all that
                apply.</p>

            <p><em style="bold">Research Question: </em>What is the combined effect of fertilizer
                and watering on cherry tomato plants? </p>
            <p> Planters were built that each contained 10 cherry tomato plants. Each planter was
                identical except that it received a different treatment of water and fertilizer than
                the other planters. Treatments consisted of a combination of one of four watering
                schedules and one of three fertilizer concentrations. The plants were tended
                according to these treatments and after 65 days the average number and weight of the
                tomatoes per plant were measured for each treatment group. </p>
            <p>Which of the following is an explanatory variable in this study? Check all that
                apply. </p>
