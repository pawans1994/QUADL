<p>Sometimes, survey questions are ordered in such a way as to deliberately bias the responses by planting an idea in an earlier question that will sway people's thoughts in a later question.</p>
<p>
            <em>Question:</em> In the year 2002, there was much controversy over the fact that the
            Augusta National Golf Club, which hosts the Masters Golf Tournament each year, does not
            accept women as members. Defenders of the

            disagreed<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T220255-0400"?> with each
            statement<?oxy_insert_end?>:</p>
<p>"The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution applies to everyone regardless of gender, race, religion, age, profession, or point of view."</p>
<p>"The First Amendment protects the right of individuals to create a private organization consisting of a specific group of people based on age, gender, race, ethnicity, or interest." </p>
<p>"The First Amendment protects the right of organizations like the Boy Scouts, the Girls Scouts, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to exist."</p>
<p>"Individuals have a right to join a private group, club, or organization that consists of people who share the same interests and personal backgrounds as they do if they so desire."</p>
<p>"Private organizations that are not funded by the government should be allowed to decide who becomes a member and who does not become a member on their own, without being forced to take input from other outside people or organizations."</p>
<p>Notice how the first and second statements steer people to favor the opinion that specialized
            groups may form private clubs. The third statement reminds people of organizations that
            are formed by
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T221341-0400"?>groups on the basis
            of gender and
            race<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T221338-0400" content="minorities"?>,
            setting the stage for them to agree with the fourth statement, which supports people's
            rights to join any private club. This in turn leads into the fifth statement, which
            focuses on a private organization's right to decide on its membership.
            <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T222445-0400" comment="I think that you are absolutely correct that the statements were deliberately designed to sway the respondents. That said, saying a particular organization (and a rich, powerful and clearly confrontational one at that) deliberately injected bias into a study is a serious charge, and could result in a libel lawsuit if they find out. It&apos;s up to you whether you want to take that chance or not. "?>As
            a group, the questions attempt to relentlessly steer a respondent towards ultimately
            agreeing with the
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T221417-0400"?>c<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T221417-0400" content="C"?>lub's

<p>Sometimes surveyors attempt to get feedback on more than one issue at a time.</p>

            <em>Question:</em> "Do you agree or disagree with this statement: 'I don't go out of my
            way to listen to modern music unless there are elements of jazz, or else lyrics that are
            clear and make
            sense.'<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T222951-0400" content=" "?>"</p>

            per se. The logic of the question (or lack thereof) may escape the respondents, and they
            would be too confused to supply an answer that correctly conveys their opinion. Clearly,
            simple questions are much better than complicated ones; rather than try to gauge
            opinions on several issues at once, complex survey questions like this should be broken
            down into shorter, more concise ones.</p>
<p>Depending on the topic, we cannot always assume that survey respondents will answer honestly. </p>
<p>
<em>Question1</em>: "Have you eaten rutabagas in the past year?"</p>
<p>If respondents answer no, then we have good reason to believe that they did not eat rutabagas in the past year.</p>
<p>
<em>Question2</em>: "Have you used illegal drugs in the past year?"</p>
<p>If respondents answer no, then it is still a possibility that they did use illegal drugs, but
                                    d<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T223144-0400"?>id<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T104055-0400" content="o"?>n't
                                    want to admit it.</p>
<p>Effective techniques for collecting accurate data on sensitive questions are a main area of inquiry in statistics. One simple method is <em>randomized response</em>, which allows individuals in the sample to answer anonymously, while the researcher still gains information about the population. This technique is best illustrated by an example.</p>
<example>

<p>For the question, "Have you used illegal drugs in the past year?" respondents are told to flip a
                                                fair coin (in private) before answering and then
                                                answer based on the result of the coin flip: if the
                                                coin flip
                                                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T223245-0400"?>results
                                                in<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T223301-0400" content="gives"?>
                                                "Heads<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T223310-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>"<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T223312-0400" content=","?>
                                                they should answer "Yes" (regardless of the truth),
                                                if a coin flip
                                                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T223331-0400"?>results
                                                in<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T223329-0400" content="gives"?>
                                                "Tails<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T223340-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>"
                                                they should answer truthfully. Thus, roughly half of
                                                the respondents are "truth-tellers," and the other
                                                half give the uncomfortable answer "Yes," without
                                                the interviewer's knowledge of who is in which
                                                group. The respondent who flips "Tails" and answers
                                                truthfully knows that he or she cannot be
                                                distinguished from someone who got "Heads" in the
                                                coin toss. Hopefully, this is enough to encourage
                                                respondents to answer truthfully. As we will learn
                                                later in the course, the surveyor can
                                                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T101433-0400"?>then
                                                <?oxy_insert_end?>use probability methods to
                                                estimate the proportion of respondents who admit
                                                they used illegal drugs in this scenario, while
                                                being unable to identify exactly which respondents
                                                have been drug<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T101443-0400"?>
                                                <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T101443-0400" content="-"?>abusers.</p>
</example>
<p>Besides using the randomized response method, surveyors may encourage honest answers from respondents in various other ways. Tactful wording of questions can be very helpful. Giving people a feeling of anonymity by having them complete questionnaires via computer, rather than paper and pencil, is another commonly used technique.</p>
