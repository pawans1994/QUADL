			<p>The next two questions refer to the following information: </p>
			<p>
				<em>Research Question: </em>What is the combined effect of medication and diet on
				blood pressure in adult males? </p>
			<p>A randomized, controlled experiment investigated this question using a random sample
				of 540 adult males as subjects. At the beginning of the study, researchers measured
				the blood pressure of all the subjects. Each subject was given a month's supply of
				either Drug A, Drug B, or a placebo, then was assigned to be on either a low-fat
				diet or a low-salt diet for that month-long period. At the end of the month, the
				researchers measured the blood pressure of each subject again, and compared the two
				blood pressure readings. </p>
