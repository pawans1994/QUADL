<title>Sample Surveys</title>
<body>
<p>A sample survey is a particular type of observational study
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214046-0400"?>in
                    which<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214044-0400" content="where"?>
                    individuals report variables' values themselves, frequently by giving their
                    opinions. Researchers have several options to choose from when deciding how to
                    survey the individuals involved: in person, or via telephone,
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214109-0400"?>I<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214108-0400" content="i"?>nternet,
                    or mail.</p>
<p>The following issues in the design of sample surveys will be discussed:</p>

                    open vs. closed questions</p>
<p>* unbalanced response options</p>
<p>* leading questions</p>
<p>* planting ideas with questions</p>
<p>* complicated questions</p>
<p>* sensitive questions</p>
<p>These issues are best illustrated with a variety of concrete examples.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to determine the musical preferences of all students at your university, based
                    on a sample of students. In the <em>Sampling</em> section, we discussed various
                    ways to obtain the sample, such as taking a simple random sample from all
                    students at the university,
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214309-0400"?>then
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>contacting
                    the<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214317-0400"?> chosen
                    subjects<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214315-0400" content="m"?>
                    via email to request their responses and
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214331-0400" content="then "?>following
                    up with a second email to those who did not respond the first time. This method
                    would ensure a sample that is fairly representative of the entire population of
                    students at the university, and avoids
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214352-0400"?>the
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>bias
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214355-0400"?>that might
                    result <?oxy_insert_end?>from
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214415-0400"?>a
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>flawed designs such as
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214409-0400"?>a
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>convenience
                    sample<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214420-0400" content="s"?>
                    or <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214421-0400"?>a

<p>However, even if we managed to select a representative sample for a survey, we are not yet home free: we must still compose the survey question itself so that the information we gather from the sampled students correctly represents what is true about their musical preferences. Let us consider some possibilities:</p>
<p>
<em>Question:</em> "What is your favorite kind of music?"</p>
<p>This is what we call an <em>open question</em>, which allows for
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214522-0400"?>almost<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214520-0400" content="rather"?>
                    unlimited responses. It may be difficult to make sense of all the possible
                    categories and
                    sub<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214533-0400" content="-"?>categories
                    of music that survey respondents could come up with. Some may be more general
                    than what you had in mind ("I like modern music the best") and others too
                    specific ("I like Japanese alternative electronic rock by Cornelius"). Responses
                    are much easier to handle if they come from a<em> closed question:</em>
                </p>
<p>
                    <em>Question:</em>
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215241-0400" content="&quot;"?>Which
                    of these types of music do you prefer: classical, rock, pop,
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214911-0400"?>or
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>hip-hop?<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215243-0400" content="&quot;"?></p>
<p>What will happen if a respondent is asked the question as worded above, and
                    he<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214940-0400"?> or
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T214939-0400" content="/"?>she
                    actually prefers jazz or folk music or gospel? He or she may pick a
                    second-favorite from the options presented, or try to pencil in the real
                    preference, or
                    may<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215047-0400" content="be"?>
                    just not respond at all. Whatever the outcome, it is likely that
                    overall<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215100-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    the responses to the question posed in this way will not give us very accurate
                    information about
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215112-0400" content="the "?>general
                    music preferences. If a closed question is used, then great care should be taken
                    to include all the reasonable options that are possible, including "not sure."
                    Also, in case an option was overlooked, "other:___________" should be included
                    for the sake of thoroughness.</p>
<p>Many surveys ask respondents to assign a rating to a variable, such as in the following:</p>
<p>
                    <em>Question:</em>
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215233-0400" content="&quot;"?>How
                    do you feel about classical music? Circle one of these: I love it, I like it
                    very much, I like it, I don't like it, I hate
                    it<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215229-0400"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215228-0400" content="&quot;"?></p>
<p>Notice that the options provided are rather
                    "top-heavy<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215258-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>"<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215259-0400" content=","?>
                    with three favorable
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215305-0400"?>options
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>vs. two unfavorable. If someone feels somewhat neutral, they
                    may opt for the middle choice, "I like it," and a summary of the survey's
                    results would distort the respondents' true opinions.</p>
<p>Some survey questions are either deliberately or unintentionally biased towards certain responses:</p>
<p>
                    <em>Question:</em> "Do you agree that classical music is the
                    best<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215359-0400"?> type
                    of music<?oxy_insert_end?>, because it has survived for centuries and is not
                    only enjoyable, but also intellectually rewarding? (Answer yes or no.)"</p>
<p>This sort of wording puts
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215421-0400"?>ideas<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215423-0400" content="words"?>
                    in people's
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215432-0400"?>heads<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101103T215429-0400" content="mouths"?>,
                    urging them to report a particular opinion. One way to test for bias in a survey
                    question is to ask yourself, "Just from reading the question, would a respondent
                    have a good idea of what response the surveyor is hoping to elicit?" If the
                    answer is yes, then the question should have been worded more neutrally.</p>
