            production, exploratory data analysis, probability, and inference. </p>

            has two modules; one about sampling and one about study design.</p>

of Statistics. First, a set of data was created from subset of the population. This is the Producing
Data step. Then, we perform exploratory data analysis on the data. With these results, we apply
probability which is our first step in drawing conclusions about the population from the data. After
we have applied probability to the data, we can draw conclusions. This is called inference, the second
step in drawing conclusions. In this unit we will be looking at the Producing Data step."/>
