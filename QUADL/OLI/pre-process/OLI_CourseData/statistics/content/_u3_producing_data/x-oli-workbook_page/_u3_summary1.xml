<p>In this
            unit<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145511-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            we discussed the first step in the big picture of
                statistics<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145542-0400"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145538-0400" content=" - "?><em>production
                of data.</em>
        </p>
<p>Production of data happens in two stages: <em>sampling</em> and <em>study design</em>.</p>
<p>Our goal in sampling is to get a <em>sample that represents the population of interest
            well</em><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145625-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            so that when we <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145646-0400"?>get
            to

            stage<?oxy_insert_end?>, making conclusions
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145718-0400"?>based
            on<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145716-0400" content="from"?>
            this sample

            the entire population will make sense. We discussed several biased sampling plans, but
            also introduced the "family" of probability sampling plans, the
            simple<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145737-0400"?>st<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145738-0400" content="r"?>
            of which is the <em>simple random sample</em>, that (at least in theory) are
            suppose<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145752-0400"?>d<?oxy_insert_end?>
            to provide a sample that is not subject to any biases.</p>
<p>In the <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145813-0400"?>section on study
            <?oxy_insert_end?>design<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145810-0400" content=" part"?>,
            we introduced 3 types of design: observational study, controlled experiment, and sample
            survey.</p>
<p>We saw that with <em>observational studies</em> it is <em>difficult to establish</em> convincing
            evidence of a <em>causal
            relationship</em><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145831-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            because of lack of control over outside variables (called lurking variables). Other
            pitfalls that may arise are that individuals' behaviors may be affected if they know
            they are participating in an observational study, and that individuals' memories may be
            faulty if they are asked to recall information from the past.</p>
<p>
            <em>Experiments</em> allow researchers to take control of lurking variables by
                <em>randomized assignment to treatments</em>, which helps provide more convincing
            evidence of causation. The design may be enhanced by making sure that subjects and/or
            researchers are <em>blind</em> to who receives what treatment. Depending on what
            relationship is being researched, it may be difficult to design an experiment whose
            setting is realistic enough that we can safely generalize
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145916-0400"?>the conclusions
            <?oxy_insert_end?>to real life.</p>
<p>Another reason that observational studies are utilized rather than experiments is that certain
            explanatory
            variables<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145932-0400"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145930-0400" content="---"?>such
            as income or alcohol
            intake<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145938-0400"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145937-0400" content="---"?>either
            can<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T145943-0400" content=" "?>not or
            should not be controlled by researchers.</p>
<p>
<em>Sample surveys</em> are occasionally used to examine relationships, but often they assess values of many separate variables, such as respondents' <em>opinions</em> on various matters. Survey questions should be designed carefully, in order to ensure unbiased assessment of the variables' values.</p>
<p><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101104T150047-0400" content="Finally, I would like to end this unit I with something that I mentioned in its introduction. "?>Throughout
            this unit, we established guidelines for the ideal production of data, which should be
            held as standards to strive for. Realistically, however, it is rarely possible to carry
            out a study which is completely free of flaws. Therefore, common sense must frequently
            be applied in order to decide which imperfections we can live with, and which ones could
            completely undermine a study's results.</p>
