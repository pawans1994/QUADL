<ul><li>Pick a cell underneath the two-way table, and type the same row and column labels in that we used for the two-way table.</li><li>Now select the cell under <code style="inline">Female</code> and to the right of <code style="inline">Treatment 1</code>.  In this cell, we want the percentage of people  who are in the first treatment group and are female.  Thus, we want to divide the number of females in the first treatment group by the total number of people in the first treatment group, and then multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage.  The specific cell references depend on where exactly you created your two-way table, but if D2 represents the number of females in the first treatment group, and F2 represents the total number of people in the first treatment group, the formula would be <code style="inline">=(D2/F2)*100</code> .</li><li>Calculate the percentages for the other cells in the same manner.</li></ul>
