            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Different random samples will yield different results, but the summaries should be roughly the same for population and sample.  Here is what we got: the percentage of right-handed students is 87% in the population and it was 88% in our random sample---close enough to assert that there is no bias.  The percentage of females is 62% in the population and 65% in our random sample---no clear evidence of bias. The verbal SAT averaged 589 for the population and 581 for our random sample---again, no clear evidence of bias.  Finally, median age for the population is 19.7 and 19.7 for our random sample---no evidence of any bias at all.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
