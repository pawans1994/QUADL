            <mattext texttype="text/plain">The percentage of right-handed students is 87% in the population and it was 91% in the sample of business students---close enough to assert that there is no clear bias. The percentage of females is 62% in the population and 52% in the sample of business students---apparently biased in that females are under-represented in business stats. The verbal SAT averaged 589 for the population and 575 for the business students---it does seem to be biased towards lower scores for business students. Finally, median age for the population is 19.7 and our sample of business students had a median age of 19.5 years---apparently the business students may be considered an unbiased sample when it comes to age.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
