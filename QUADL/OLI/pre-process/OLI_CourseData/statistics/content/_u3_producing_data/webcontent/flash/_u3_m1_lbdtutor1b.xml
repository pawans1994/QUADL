            <mattext texttype="text/plain">* Handedness - should be representative.  Business students shouldn't be any different from other students with respect to this variable.
* sex - could easily be biased. We expect fewer women in business than in the social or natural sciences.
* verbal - could easily be biased.  Business students' verbal SATs may tend to be lower, since there are fewer women and women tend to do better on the verbal portion of the SATs (as the background to this problem suggests).
* age - should be representative.  Regardless of major, students may take introductory statistics at about the same point in their college career (as suggested by the background).</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
