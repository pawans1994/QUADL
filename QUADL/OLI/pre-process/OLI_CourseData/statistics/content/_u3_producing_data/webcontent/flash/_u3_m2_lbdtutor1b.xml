        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Based on your answer to the question above, does the randomization allow us to study the differences in user preferences between the three browsers, while eliminating the possible effects of the lurking variables age, gender, and hours per week of computer use?

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Our results suggest that the distributions age, gender, and hours per week of computer use among the three treatments are about the same; therefore, the randomization was successful in balancing these three potential lurking variables among the three treatment groups. We can be fairly sure that any difference between the treatment groups that we find on the user tests of the software will be due to differences in the three software versions, rather than the lurking variables of age, gender, and hours per week of computer use.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
