            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Everyone will get slightly different displays here, but they should all "look" the same.  Based upon the side-by-side boxplots, the distribution of ages and hours per week of computer use appears the same in each of the three treatment groups.  Similarly, the table of conditional percents suggests that the distribution of the genders is about the same in all three treatment groups.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
