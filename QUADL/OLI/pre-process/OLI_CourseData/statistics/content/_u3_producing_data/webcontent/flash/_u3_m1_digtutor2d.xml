            <mattext texttype="text/plain">In cluster sampling the groups are heterogeneous and each should be a small scale representation of the population.  In stratified sampling the groups should be homogeneous meaning that all those within each stratum are as much alike as possible.  To accomplish this we frequently use multi-stage stratification.

In cluster sampling whole groups are selected.  Since each cluster represents the population it must be selected in its entirety to maintain that representation.  Since all of the elements within each stratum are pretty similar to each other, if we chose several whole stratum, many in the population would not be represented.  Selecting some from each group insures that each group in the population is adequately represented.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
