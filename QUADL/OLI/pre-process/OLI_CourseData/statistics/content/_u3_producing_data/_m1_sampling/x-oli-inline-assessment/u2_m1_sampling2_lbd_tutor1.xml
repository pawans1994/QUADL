         For part A., we will now determine whether the four variables' behavior for the random sample is comparable to their behavior for the population. 
         <p>Place your findings from Part A, steps 1-4 above in the text box below.</p>

            <p>Different random samples will yield different results, but the summaries should be roughly the same for population and sample.  Here is what we got: </p>
             <p>Step 1. The percentage of right-handed students is 87% in the population and it was
               88% in our random sample; close enough to assert that there is no bias.</p>
            <p>Step 2. The percentage of females is 62% in the population and 65% in our random
               sample; there is no clear evidence of bias. </p>
            <p> Step 3. The SAT Verbal scores averaged 589 for the population and 581 for our random
               sample; again, there is no clear evidence of bias.</p>  
               <p> Step 4. Finally, median age for the population is 19.7 and 19.7 for our random
               sample; there is no evidence of any bias at all.</p>
