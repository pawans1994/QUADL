      <body>
         <p>For part B., let's look at each of the variables&#8212;Handed, Sex, Verbal, and Age&#8212;decide whether or not
            you believe the sample of business statistics students should be fairly representative
            of the larger population of all students in introductory statistics courses.</p>
      </body>
      <short_answer id="A"/>
      <part>
         <response input="A" match="*" score="1"/>
         <explanation>
            <p>&#8226; Handed&#8212;should be representative. Business students shouldn't be any
               different from other students with respect to this variable.</p>
            <p>&#8226; Sex&#8212;could easily be biased. We expect fewer women in business than in
               the social or natural sciences.</p>
            <p>&#8226; Verbal&#8212;could easily be biased. Business students' SAT Verbal scores may
               tend to be lower, since there are likely to be fewer women, and women tend to do
               better on the verbal portion of the SAT (as the background to this problem
               suggests).</p>
            <p>&#8226; Age&#8212;should be representative. Regardless of major, students may take
               introductory statistics at about the same point in their college career (as suggested
               by the background).</p>
