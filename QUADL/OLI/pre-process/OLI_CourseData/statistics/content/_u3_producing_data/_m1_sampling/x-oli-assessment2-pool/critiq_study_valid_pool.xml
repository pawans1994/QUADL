            <p>The faculty senate at a large university wanted to know what proportion of the
                students thought foreign language classes should be required for everyone. The
                statistics department offered to cooperate in conducting a survey, and a simple
                random sample of 500 students was selected from all the students enrolled in
                statistics classes. A survey form was sent by email to these 500 students. </p>
            <p>True or false? Since the sample is random, it is representative of the population of
                interest. </p>

                    a larger sampling frame, there are two reasons this study is <em style="italic">not</em> representative
                    of the population of interest: (1) The sampling frame was only students in
                    statistics (so the sampling frame didn’t match the population of interest), and
                    (2) Returning the survey was voluntary (so the study results were potentially
                    biased and thus not representative, even of just statistics students).

                    only students in statistics (so the sampling frame didn’t match the population

            <p>The city council hired three college interns to measure public support for a large
                parks and recreation initiative in their city. The interns mailed surveys to 500
                randomly selected participants in the current public recreation program. They
                received 150 responses.</p>
