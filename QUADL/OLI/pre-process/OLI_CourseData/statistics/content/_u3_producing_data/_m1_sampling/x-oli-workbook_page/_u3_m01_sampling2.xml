        <p>So far we've discussed several sampling plans,

        <p>A simple random sample is the easiest way to base a selection on randomness. There are
            other, more sophisticated, sampling techniques that utilize randomness

            are often preferable in real-life circumstances. Any plan that relies on random
            selection is called a <em>probability sampling plan (or technique)</em>. The following
            three probability sampling plans are among the most commonly used: </p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Simple Random Sampling</em> is, as the name suggests, the simplest probability
                sampling plan. It is equivalent to “selecting names out of a hat<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T140504-0400"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?>”<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T140456-0400" content=", where"?>

                sampling technique is used when our population is naturally divided into groups
                (which we call clusters). For example, all the students in a university are divided
                into majors; all the nurses in a certain city are divided into hospitals; all
                registered voters are divided into precincts (election districts). In cluster

This could radically affect the results of almost any study you conduct. Even if there are only six schools (three of each type) and you choose half of them, you will end up with an unrepresentative sample (at best, two of one type and three of another).

                stratified sampling, we choose a simple random sample from each stratum, and our
                sample consists of all these simple random samples put together. For example, in
                order to get a random sample of high-school seniors from a certain city, we choose a

            </ul>
        <p>Each of those probability sampling plans, if applied correctly, are not subject to any
            bias, and thus produce samples that represent well the population from which they were
            drawn. </p>

            <title>Comment: Cluster vs. Stratified</title>
            <body>        <p>Students sometimes get confused about the difference between cluster sampling and
                    stratified sampling. Even though both methods start out with the population
                    somehow divided into groups, the two methods are very different. In cluster
                    sampling<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T142521-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    we take a random sample of whole groups of individuals, while in stratified
                    sampling we take a simple random sample from each group. For example, say we
                    want to conduct a study on the sleeping habits of undergraduate students at a
                    certain university, and need to obtain a sample. The students are naturally
                    divided by majors, and let's say that in this university there are 40 different
                    majors. In cluster
                    sampling<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T142621-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    we would randomly choose, say, 5 majors (groups) out of the 40, and use all the
                    students in these five majors as our sample.
                    <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T143258-0400" comment="Sorry to be a pain, but again, this seems like it could be problematic. 10 students from each major won&apos;t necessarily result in a good representation of the university, because you might be choosing 10 out of 30 anthropology majors and giving their responses the same weight as 10 out of 500 computer science majors. The habits of anthropology majors will be unevenly represented with regard to the total university population."?>In
                    stratified sampling, we would obtain a random

                    from each of the 40 majors (groups), and use the 400 chosen students as the
                    sample.<?oxy_comment_end?> Clearly in this example, stratified sampling is much

                    on the student's sleeping habits, and so we would like to make sure that we have
                    representatives from all the different majors. We’ll stress this point again

        <example>
        <p>Suppose you would like to study the job satisfaction of hospital nurses in a certain city
                based on a sample. Besides taking a simple random sample, here are two additional
                ways to obtain such a
                sample<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T143329-0400"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?>
            </p>
        <p>1. Suppose that the city
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T143413-0400"?>has<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T143412-0400" content="is"?>
                10 hospitals. Choose one of the 10 hospitals at random and interview all the nurses
                in that hospital regarding their job satisfaction. This is an example
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T143435-0400"?>of
                <?oxy_insert_end?>cluster sampling<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T143444-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>

        <body><p> Let’s go back and revisit the job satisfaction of hospital nurses example and discuss the pros
                    and cons of the two sampling plans that are presented. Certainly, it will be
                    much easier to conduct the study using the cluster
                    sample<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T145203-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    since all interviews are conducted in one hospital as opposed to the stratified
                    sample, in which the interviews need to be conducted in 10 different hospitals.
                    However<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T145218-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    the hospital that a nurse works in probably has a direct impact on his/her job
                    satisfaction, and in that
                    sense<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T145232-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    getting data from just one hospital might provide biased results. In this
                    case<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T145242-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    it will be very important to have representation from all the city
                    hospitals<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T145344-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    and therefore the stratified sample is definitely preferable. On the other hand,
                    say that instead of job satisfaction, our study focuses on the age or weight of
                    hospital nurses. </p>
        <p>In this
                    case<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T145359-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    it is probably not as crucial to get representation from the different
                    hospitals<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T145409-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    and therefore the more easily obtained cluster sample might be preferable. </p></body></section>

    <p>4. The person responsible for polling takes a random sample of 50 staff members from the

            grading all of the problems for each student, he will grade a random sample of problems.
            His first offer, to grade a random sample of just 3 problems for each student, is not
            well-received by the professor, who fears that such a small sample may not provide a
            very precise estimate of a student's overall homework performance. Students are
            particularly concerned that the random selection may happen to include one or two
            problems on which they performed poorly, thereby lowering their grade. The next offer,
            to grade a random sample of 25 problems for each student, is deemed acceptable by both

        <p>In practice, we are confronted with many trade-offs in statistics. A larger sample is
            more informative about the population, but it is also more costly in terms of time and
            money. Researchers must make an effort to keep their costs down, but still obtain a
            sample that is large enough to allow them to report fairly precise results. </p></body>

            <title>Let's Summarize</title>
            <body>
                <p>Our goal, in statistics, is to use information from a sample to draw conclusions
                    about the larger group, called the population. The<em> first step</em> in this
                    process is to<em> obtain a sample</em> of individuals that are truly
                    representative of the population. If this step is not carried out properly, then
                    the sample is subject to bias, a systematic tendency to misrepresent the
                    variables of interest in the population.</p>
                <p>Bias is almost guaranteed if a<em> volunteer sample</em> is used. If the
                    individuals select themselves for the study, they are often different in an
                    important way from
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T155708-0400" content="all "?>the
                    individuals who did not volunteer. A <em>convenience sample</em>, chosen because
                    individuals were in the right place at the right time to suit the researcher,
                    may be different from the general population in a subtle but important way.
                    However, for certain variables of interest, a convenience sample may still be
                    fairly representative. The <em>sampling frame</em> of individuals from whom the
                    sample is actually selected should match the population of interest; bias may
                    result if parts of the population are systematically excluded. <em>Systematic
                        sampling</em> takes an organized (but not random) approach to the selection
                    process, as in picking every 50th name on a list, or the first product to come
                    off the production line each hour. Just as with convenience sampling, there may
                    be subtle sources of bias in such a plan, or it may be adequate for the purpose
                    at hand. Most studies are subject to some degree of
                        <em>non<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T155818-0400" content="-"?>response</em>,
                    referring to individuals who do not go along with the researchers' intention to
                    include them in a study. If there are too many
                    non<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T160047-0400" content="-"?>respondents,
                    and they are different from respondents in an important way, then the sample
                    turns out to be biased.</p>
                <p>In general, bias may be eliminated (in theory), or at least reduced (in
                    practice), if researchers do their best to implement a <em>probability sampling
                        plan </em>that utilizes <em>randomness</em>. The most basic probability
                    sampling plan is a <em>simple random sample</em>, where every group of
                    individuals has the same chance of being selected as every other group of the
                    same size. This is achieved by sampling at random and without replacement. In a
                        <em>cluster sample</em>, groups of individuals are randomly selected, such
                    as all people in the same household.
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T160205-0400"?>In a
                    cluster sample, all members of each selected group participate in the study.
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>A <em>stratified sample</em> divides the population into
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T160253-0400" content="similar "?>groups
                    called strata before selecting

                    participants <?oxy_insert_end?>at random
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T160310-0400"?>from
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>within those groups. <em>Multistage sampling</em> makes the
                    sampling process more manageable by working down from a large population to
                    successively smaller groups within the population, taking advantage of
                    stratifying along the way, and sometimes finishing up with a cluster
                    sample<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T160344-0400"?> or a
                    simple random sample<?oxy_insert_end?>.</p>
                <p>Assuming the various sources of bias have been avoided, researchers can learn
                    more about the variables of interest for the population by taking <em>larger
                        samples</em>. The "extreme" (meaning, the largest possible sample) would be
                    to study every single individual in the population (the goal of a census), but
                    in
                    practice<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T160420-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    such a design is rarely feasible. Instead, researchers must try to obtain the
                    largest sample that fits in their
                    budget<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T160438-0400"?> (in

                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T160449-0400"?>must
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>take great care that the sample is truly representative of the
