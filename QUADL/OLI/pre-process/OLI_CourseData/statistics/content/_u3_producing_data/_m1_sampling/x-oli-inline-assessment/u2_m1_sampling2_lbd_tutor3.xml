            <p>Step 1. The percentage of right-handed students is 87% in the population and it was 91%
               in the sample of business students; close enough to assert that there is no clear
               bias. </p>
            <p>Step 2. The percentage of females is 62% in the population and 52% in the sample of
               business students; apparently biased, in that females are under-represented in
               business statistics. </p>
            <p>Step 3. The SAT Verbal score averaged 589 for the population and 575 for the business
               students; the sample does seem to be biased, due to lower SAT Verbal scores for
               business students. </p>
            <p>Step 4. Finally, the median age for the population is 19.7 and our sample of business
               students had a median age of 19.5 years; apparently the business students may be
               considered an unbiased sample when it comes to age.</p>
