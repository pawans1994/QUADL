        <p>The purpose of this activity is to show you how a simple random sample produces a sample
            that is not subject to any bias and is thus representative of the population from which
            it was selected. Also, we'll see how a nonrandom sample can produce some sources of
            bias.</p>
        <section>
            <title>Background</title>
            <body>
                <p>Consider the population of all students at a large university taking introductory
                    statistics courses (1,129 students taking statistics for business, social
                    sciences, or natural sciences). </p>
                <p>Suppose we are interested in the values of four specific variables for this
                    population: handedness (right-handed or left-handed), sex, SAT Verbal score, and
                    age. If we were unable to determine the values of those variables for the entire
                    population, we may be able to take a random sample from that population, and use
                    the sample summaries as estimates for population summaries. Would the random
                    sample provide unbiased estimates for the population values?</p>
                <p>Next, what if instead of taking a random sample, we sampled the 192 students who
                    happen to be enrolled in the business statistics course? First we will intuit,
                    then check, if they would be a representative sample with respect to each of the
                    four variables: handedness, sex, SAT Verbal score, and age. It may be helpful
                    for you to know that, at this university, all students have comparable options
                    in terms of when they take introductory statistics. You should also know that
                    women, on the whole, tend to do somewhat better than men on the verbal portion
                    of the SAT, and that business is a major that tends to interest males more than
                    females.</p>
            </body>
        </section>
        <p>To summarize the goals for this activity, we will:</p>
        <p><em style="bold">Part A.</em> Verify that the distributions of the variables handedness,
            sex, SAT Verbal score, and age are roughly the same for the random sample as they are
            for the population.</p>
        <p><em style="bold">Part B.</em> Intuit whether the distributions of each of the four
            variables in the (nonrandom) sample of business students would be roughly the same as
            those for the population, or whether there is a reason to expect any of them to be
            biased.</p>
        <p><em style="bold">Part C.</em> Check our intuition by comparing the distributions of each
            of the four variables for the sample of business students with those for the population,
            and determine whether they are roughly the same or if the sample values for any of the
            variables appear to be biased.</p>
        <p>Our dataset contains data on the entire population of 1,129 students, which includes
            students taking introductory statistics who are majoring in the natural and social
            sciences, as well as for business majors.</p>

                        consistency, we will make the random sample the same size (192) as the

                        later.</p>

                    <p>If you want to continue with the TI Calculator, you can produce a table of
                        counts and percentages by hand using your TI to help. You can download an
                        app that will allow you to construct a pie chart. </p>

                        you'll need to create 2 extra lists called <code style="inline">VERBL</code>

                    <p>The original dataset includes the following variables: </p>
                    <ul style="none">

                    <p>Since the maximum list size on the TI 83/84 graphing calculator is 999, it is
                        difficult to store the entire dataset on the TI (you could do it by
                        splitting it into a couple of lists but it’s not pretty). So, we’ve given
                        you a simple random sample of the data and will also give you the
                        information you need about the population to compare the samples you have in
                        the lists to the population (which you don’t have in the lists). For the
                        sake of consistency, we made the random sample the same size (192) as the
                        nonrandom sample of business statistics students that will be examined
                        later. </p>
