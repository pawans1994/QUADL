        <p>In this short module we learned various techniques by which one can choose a sample of
            individuals from an entire population
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T191121-0400"?>to
            <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T191123-0400" content="and "?>collect
            data
            from<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T191136-0400" content=" them"?>.
            This is seemingly a simple step in the big picture of statistics, but it turns out that
            it has a crucial effect on the conclusions we can draw from
            th<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T190426-0400"?>e<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T190425-0400" content="is"?>
            sample about the entire population (i.e., inference).</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, a probability sampling plan (such as a simple random sample, cluster,
            or stratified sampling) will result in a
            non<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T190658-0400" content="-"?>biased
            sample, which can be safely used
            <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T190706-0400" content="in order "?>to
            make
            inference<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T190712-0400"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>.
            Moreover, the inferential procedures that we will learn later
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T190750-0400"?>i<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T190749-0400" content="o"?>n
            this course assume that the sample was chosen at random. That being said, other
            (non<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T190804-0400" content="-"?>random)
            sampling techniques are available, and sometimes using them is the best we can do. It is
            important<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T190828-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            though, when these techniques are used, to be aware of the
            type<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T191349-0400"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>
            of bias that they introduce, and thus the limitations of the conclusions that can be
            drawn from the<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101102T190845-0400"?>
            resulting
