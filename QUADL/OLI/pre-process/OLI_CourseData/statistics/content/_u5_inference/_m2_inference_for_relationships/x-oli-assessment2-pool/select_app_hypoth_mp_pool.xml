            <p>Research suggests that the pressure of being timed may interfere with performance on
                tests that involve mathematical problems. A fictional study was conducted with 30
                sixth graders. First, the sixth graders were given a math test that contained 50
                problems and were told that they had only one hour to complete it (timed condition).
                The same sixth graders were later given a math test that contained 50 problems and
                were told that they could have as much time, as needed, to complete the test
                (unlimited time condition). The total number of correct answers for each sixth
                grader was then calculated for each condition. Then, for each student, the
                difference between the two scores (timed − untimed) was calculated. The researchers
                hypothesized that the sixth graders would get fewer correct answers when they took
                the test with a time limit than when they had unlimited time.</p>

            <p>Developmental psychology researchers have shown a genetic influence of shyness in
                infants where infants who were adopted were more likely to be rated as shy at 2
                years of age if their biological mothers rated themselves as also being shy (Daniels
                &amp; Plomin, 1985). A researcher wanted to find out if this finding extended to
                shyness in identical twins. The researcher recruited a sample of 35 pairs of infants
                who were identical twins. The researcher asked the infants’ primary caregiver to
                rate each infant’s level of shyness and compared the shyness level between each
                identical twin to see if there was a mean difference in shyness between the pairs of
                identical twins. </p>
