            <p>Some research suggests that first born children may have higher IQ scores than their
                later born siblings. Do first-born identical twins have higher IQ scores than their
                second-born sibling? Data from a 1998 study
                <!--by Tramo, Loftus, Stukel, Weaver, and
                Gazzaniga -->were analyzed
                to determine whether first-born identical twins have higher IQ scores than their
                second-born siblings. Ten pairs of adult identical twins were assessed and their
                Full Scale IQ scores were calculated.</p>

            <p>The director of a daycare center noticed that the infants were getting more diaper
                rashes than usual in the summer time. The policy of the center was to change the
                diapers on a schedule every three hours. The director wanted to find out if<!-- changing-->
                adjusting the diaper-changing schedule to every two hours would significantly reduce
                the number of diaper rashes. Since some of the infants seemed to have more sensitive
                skin, she decided to directly compare the number of diaper rashes for each
                individual infant when the diaper was changed every three hours versus every two
                hours. For the first week, the daycare center changed the diapers as usual every
                three hours and noted the number of days that each infant had symptoms of a diaper
                rash. During the second week, the teachers changed diapers every two hours and
                recorded the number of days with symptoms of a diaper rash. At the end of the two
                weeks, they compared for each individual infant the number of days with symptoms of
                a diaper rash when the diapers were changed every three hours versus every two
                hours. </p>

                diapers were changed every three hours and two hours, respectively, and let μ<sub>d</sub> be
                the mean of the differences in the number of days with symptoms of a diaper rash
                (diaper rash days when changed every three hours minus diaper rash days when changed
                every two hours). </p>
