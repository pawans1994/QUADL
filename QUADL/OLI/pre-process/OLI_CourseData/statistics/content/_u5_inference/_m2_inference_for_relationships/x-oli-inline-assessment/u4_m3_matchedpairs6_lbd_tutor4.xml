                        <p>The test statistic is -1.69 and the p-value is .061, indicating that
                            there is a 6.1% chance of obtaining data like those observed (or even
                            more extremely in favor of the alternative hypothesis) had there really
                            been no difference between regular and kiln-dried seeds (as the null
                            hypothesis claims). Even though the p-value is quite small, it is not
                            small enough if we use a significance level (cut-off probability) of
                            .05. This means that even though the data show some evidence against the
                            null hypothesis, it isn't quite strong enough to reject it. We therefore
                            conclude that the data do not provide enough evidence that kiln-dried
                            seeds yield more corn than regular seeds. </p>
                        <p>Comment: While it is true that at the .05 significance level, our p-value
                            is not small enough to reject H<sub>o</sub>, it is "almost small
                            enough." In other words, this is sort of a "borderline case" where
                            personal interpretation and/or judgment is in order. You can stick to
                            the .05 cut-off as we did above in our conclusion, but you might decide
                            that .061 is small enough for you, and that the evidence that the data
                            provide is strong enough for you to believe that indeed kiln-dried seeds
                            yield more corn. This is the beauty of statistics ... there is no "black
                            or white," and there is a lot of room for personal interpretation. </p>
