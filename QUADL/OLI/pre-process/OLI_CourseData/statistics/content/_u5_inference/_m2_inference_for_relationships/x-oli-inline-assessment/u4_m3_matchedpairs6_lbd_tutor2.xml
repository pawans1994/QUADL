<p>Let's check the conditions:</p>
<p>(i) Even though the problem does not state it specifically, we can assume that Gosset "knew what he was doing" and the plots were chosen at random.</p>
<p>(ii) The sample size is quite small (n<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220241-0500"?>
          <?oxy_insert_end?>=<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220241-0500"?>
          <?oxy_insert_end?>11), so we need to make sure that the data (differences) do not display
          any extreme departure from the normality assumption. Typically we look at a histogram.</p>
<p>Comment: some prefer to look at a boxplot of the data, since outliers are clearly marked, and
          skew<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220255-0500" content="ed"?>ness is
          apparent by the location of the middle line inside the box (which represents the location
          of the median relative to the quartiles). We recommend looking at the histogram (as we did
          previously) or at both graphs. </p>
<p>Click <link href="javascript:loadImage('../../../../webcontent/inline_assessment/lbd010.gif')">here</link> to see the histogram and boxplot of the data.</p>
<p>Both graphs show us that the data does not display any departure from the normality assumption in
          the form of extreme
          skew<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220316-0500" content="ed"?>ness
          and/or outliers. (Note that
          1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220325-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220323-0500" content="."?>
          with such a small sample size of n<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220331-0500"?>
          <?oxy_insert_end?>=<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220331-0500"?>
          <?oxy_insert_end?>11 we cannot really expect to see a normal shape in the
          histogram<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220341-0500"?>;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220341-0500" content=","?>
          so as long as we don't see anything that is extremely
          "non-normal<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220345-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>"<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220346-0500" content=","?>
          we're fine.

          The boxplot shows us that no observation was classified as an outlier, and that there is
          no extreme
          skew<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220359-0500" content="ed"?>ness<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T220403-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
          since the

<p>In summary, we can safely proceed with the paired t-test.</p>
