            <title>Step 2: Checking the Conditions and Calculating the Test Statistic</title>
            <body>
                <p>Given our discussion on the previous page, it would be natural to present the
                    test statistic, and then come back to the conditions that allow us to safely use
                    the chi-square test, although in practice this is done the other way around.</p>
                <p>The single number that summarizes the overall difference between observed and
                    expected counts is the chi-square statistic <m:math overflow="scroll">
                        <m:mrow>

                        </m:mrow>
                    </m:math> , which tells us in a standardized way how far what we observed (data)
                    is from what would be expected if H<sub>o</sub> were true. </p>

                <p>As we expected, <m:math overflow="scroll">
                        <m:mrow>
                            <m:msup>

                        </m:mrow>
                    </m:math> is based on each of the differences: observed count - expected count
                    (one such difference for each cell), but why is it squared? Why do we divide
                    each square difference by the expected count? The reason we do that is so that
                    the null distribution of <m:math overflow="scroll">
                        <m:mrow>

                        </m:mrow>
                    </m:math> will have a known null distribution (under which p-values can be
                    easily calculated). The details are really beyond the scope of this course, but
                    we will just say that the null distribution of <m:math overflow="scroll">
                        <m:mrow>
                            <m:msup>

                            </m:msup>
                        </m:mrow>
                    </m:math> is called chi-square (which is not very surprising given that the test
                    is called the chi-square test), and like the t-distributions there are many
                    chi-square distributions distinguished by the number of degrees of freedom
                    associated with them. </p>

                    <li><p> The sample should be random.</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <p> In general, the larger the sample, the more accurate and reliable the
                            test results are. There are different versions of what the conditions
                            are that will ensure reliable use of the test, all of which involve the
                            expected counts. One version of the conditions says that all expected
                            counts need to be greater than 1, and at least 80% of expected counts
                            need to be greater than 5. A more conservative version requires that all
                            expected counts are larger than 5.</p></li>

                <p>Once the chi-square statistic has been calculated, we can get a feel for its
                    size: is there a relatively large difference between what we observed and what
                    the null hypothesis claims, or a relatively small one? It turns out that for a
                    2-by-2 case like ours, we are inclined to call the chi-square statistic "large"
                    if it is larger than 3.84. Therefore, our test statistic is not large,
                    indicating that the data are not different enough from the null hypothesis for
                    us to reject it (we will also see that in the p-value not being small). For
                    other cases (other than 2-by-2) there are different cut-offs for what is
                    considered large, which are determined by the null distribution in that case. We
                    are therefore going to rely only on the p-value to draw our conclusions. Even
                    though we cannot really use the chi-square statistic, it was important to learn
                    about it, since it encompasses the idea behind the test.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this activity is to continue to explore whether the risk of
                    alcohol problems among New York firefighters and first responders is related to
                    participation in the 911 rescue. In particular, in this activity, we will state
                    the hypotheses that are being tested, learn how to carry out the chi-square test
                    for independence using statistical software, and check whether the conditions
                    under which this test can be safely used are met.</p>
