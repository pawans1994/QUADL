        <body><p>Research suggests that identical twins have many similarities, such as body
                weights, even as adults. A sample of ten sets of identical twins were weighed and
                had their weights recorded in kilograms. The researcher wishes to test whether there
                is a statistically significant difference in adult weight between first-born and
                second-born identical twins.</p>

            <p>The local power company is testing a new type of thermostat that automatically
                changes the air conditioning settings on “peak days” to see if using the new
                thermostat will reduce power consumption. The power company randomly selects 35
                homes of a similar size to test the new thermostat. They compare the average summer
                power consumption before and after the new thermostat is installed. The power
                company wishes to find out if there is evidence to suggest that energy use was
                significantly higher before the new thermostats were installed (with lower energy
                use after the new thermostats were installed).</p>
