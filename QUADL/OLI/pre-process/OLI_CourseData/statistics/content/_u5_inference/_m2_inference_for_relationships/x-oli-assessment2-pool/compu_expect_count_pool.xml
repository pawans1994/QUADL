            <p>To determine if there is a relationship between grade performance and extracurricular
                participation, North Carolina State conducted a study of 112 students, recording the
                number of students in each of three extracurricular categories, and each of two
                grade categories. Here are the results: <image style="block" src="../webcontent/assessment9q18image1.gif" /> Source:
