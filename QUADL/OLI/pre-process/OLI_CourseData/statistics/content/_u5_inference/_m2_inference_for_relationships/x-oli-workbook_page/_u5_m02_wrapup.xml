        <title>Wrap-Up (Inference for Relationships)</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>We've just completed the part of the course about the inferential methods for relationships between
            variables. The overall goal of inference for
            relationships is to assess whether the observed data provide evidence of a significant
            relationship between the two variables (i.e., a true relationship that exists in the
            population).</p>
        <p>Much like the module about relationships in the

            (EDA)<?oxy_insert_end?> unit, this part of the course was organized according to the
            role and type classification of the two variables involved. However, unlike the EDA
            module, when it comes to inferential methods, we further distinguished between three
            sub-cases in case C→Q, so essentially we covered 5 cases in total. </p>

It describes all of the possible combinations of Explanatory and Response variables and how to perform
inference for each.
                Categorical Explanatory and Categorical Response (C→C):
        * Visualization is done with a 2-way table (Groups on the rows and Outcomes on the columns)
        * Numerical Summary are conditional percentages
        * Formal Inference is done using the Chi-Square test for Indepdendence.
        
                Categorical Explanatory and Quantitative Response (C→Q):
        * Visualization is done with side-by-side Boxplots
        * Numerical Summary is done using descriptive statistics
        * Formal Inference has 4 cases:
    - 2 independent samples: two-sample t-test
    - 2 dependent samples: paired t-test
    - 2 independent samples: ANOVA
    - 2 dependent samples: Not covered in the course.
    
                Quantitative Explanatory and Categorical Response (Q→C):
         * Logistic Regression, not covered in this course
         
                Quantitative Explanatory and Quantitative Response (Q→Q):
         * Visualization is done with a scatterplot. The horizontal axis is for the explanatory variable
and the vertical axis is for the response variable.
         * Numerical Summaries are done using a Correlation Coefficient
         * Formal Inference is done with a regression line, and significance test for the linear relationship
(t-test for the slope)"/>

                <p>Before you do the checkpoint activity, please evaluate your understanding of the learning
                    objectives for this module and use the first <em>My
                        Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about the
                    material that you would like the instructor to address. Your questions can be
                    for clarification of the material or further insight. Your self-evaluation and
                    questions may also shape the discussions in class.</p>
                <p>Your response will not be graded, but will be available for your instructor to
                    read. Answering these questions may also shape the discussions in class.</p>
