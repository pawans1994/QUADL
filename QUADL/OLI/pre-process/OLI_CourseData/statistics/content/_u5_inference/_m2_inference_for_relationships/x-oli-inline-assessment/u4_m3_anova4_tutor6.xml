                <feedback>Correct. In scenario 1 we see more spread within each of the four samples
                    (IQR roughly 30 and full range roughly 60) compared to scenario 2 (IQR roughly 3
                    and the full range is roughly 6). </feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. What is the approximate IQR in each of the samples in scenario
                    1? What is the approximate IQR in each of the samples in scenario 2? Which one

                <feedback>Incorrect. The two scenarios do not have the same within-group
                    variability. What is the approximate IQR in each of the samples in scenario 1?

            <hint>Look at the two sets of boxplots. In which scenario do we see more spread within
                each of the groups? Look at the IQR (represented by the height of the box) as well
                as the full range. </hint>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that in scenario 1 we have a larger within group
                    variability. In other words, in scenario 1 the denominator of the F test
                    statistic is larger. Recall also that in both scenarios the numerator of the F
                    test statistic is roughly equal (since the sample means in both scenarios are
                    very similar). </feedback>

            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. In both scenarios the numerator of the F test statistic is
                    roughly equal (since the sample means in both scenarios are very similar). Since
                    in scenario 2 we have smaller within group variability and therefore the
                    denominator of the F test statistic is smaller, the F test statistic is larger.

            <hint>Recall that the F test statistic = (Variation between sample means)/(Variation
                within groups) and that in both scenarios the sample means are very similar and so
                the numerator in both scenarios is practically the same. </hint>
