                        deviations is: largest SD / smallest SD &lt; 2. In this case, we can assume
                        that the condition is met, since the largest sample SD is 5.7, the smallest
                        SD is 4.9 and 5.7 / 4.9 &lt; 2.</feedback>

                <p>To determine the relative effectiveness of different study strategies for the
                    SAT, suppose three groups of students are randomly selected: One group took the
                    SAT without any prior studying; the second group took the SAT after studying on
                    their own from a common study booklet available in the bookstore; and the third
                    group took the SAT after completing a paid summer study session from a private

                    SAT score is related to study strategy. </p>
                <p>The following hypotheses were tested:</p>

                        three SAT means (of the three learning strategies) are not all equal. In
                        other words, we have strong evidence that performance on the SATs is related
                        to learning strategy. However, “The data provide strong evidence that SAT
                        scores are related to learning strategy in the following way: The mean SAT
                        score for students who pay for coaching is higher than the mean SAT score
                        for students who study themselves, which in turn is higher than that of
                        students who do not study for the test” is not a valid conclusion. Although
                        ANOVA can tell you whether or not all of the means are equal, it cannot tell
                        you how they are ordered (it cannot tell you which way of preparing for the
                        SAT works best). Also, “The data do not provide sufficient evidence that SAT
                        scores are related to learning strategy” is not a valid conclusion. The
                        p-value is extremely small (approximately 0), therefore strong evidence
                        exists to reject H<sub>0</sub>.</feedback>

            <p>A GRE course prep company advertises that its course can significantly raise students
                GRE Verbal Reasoning scores. In order to assess the accuracy of this claim, a
                researcher randomly selected a sample of 30 graduating seniors from a local
                university, who are applying to business school.</p>
            <p>The 30 students first took the GRE, without any preparation. The 30 students then
                took the GRE again, after completing the GRE prep course. The researcher then
                compared the performance for each student to determine whether there was improvement
                on the GRE Verbal Reasoning scores from the first to second administrations.</p>

                    here we are comparing only two. Also, in ANOVA the samples are independent which
                    is not the case here. Since the same group of students was measured twice
                    (before and then after the GRE prep course) the samples are not

                <feedback>Incorrect. While it is correct that we’re comparing two groups, the

                    (before and then after the GRE prep course). A two-sample t-test should be used
