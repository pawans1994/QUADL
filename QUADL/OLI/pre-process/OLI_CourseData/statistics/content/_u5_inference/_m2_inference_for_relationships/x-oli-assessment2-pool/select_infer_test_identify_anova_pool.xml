            <p>Advertising researchers claim that the power of curiosity can be harnessed to design
                an effective Internet advertising strategy that results in a better evaluation of
                the advertised product. They develop six advertising texts with varying amounts of
                "curiosity" triggers. College students are randomly assigned to one of the six
                versions of the advertisement text and their evaluation score of the advertised
                product is recorded.</p>
            <p>Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical test to use to test if the
                six versions of the advertisement text differ in their evaluation score?</p>
