            <title>Step 3: Finding the p-value of the test</title>
            <body>
                <p>Since our test is called the two-sample t test ,we know that the p-values are
                    calculated under a t distribution. Indeed, it turns out that the null
                    distribution of our test statistic is approximately t. Figuring out which one of
                    the t distributions (in other words, how many degrees of freedom this t
                    distribution has) is quite involved and will not be discussed here. Instead, we
                    use a statistics package to find that the p-value in this case is 0.</p>

                            <p>A p-value which is practically 0 means that it would be almost
                                impossible to get data like that observed (or even more extreme) had
                                the null hypothesis been true.</p>
                            <p>More specifically to our example, if there were no differences
                                between females and males with respect to whether they value looks
                                vs. personality, it would be almost impossible (probability

                                means of females and males is -2.6 (that difference is 10.73 - 13.33 = -2.6) or higher.

                <p>As usual a small p-value provides evidence against H<sub>o</sub>. In our case our p-value is
                    practically 0 (which smaller than any level of significance that we will
                    choose). The data therefore provide very strong evidence against H<sub>o</sub> so we reject
                    it and conclude that the mean Importance score (of looks vs personality) of
                    males differs from that of females. In other words, males and females differ with respect
                    to how they value looks vs. personality.</p>

                <p>You might ask yourself: "Where do we use the test statistic?"</p>
                <p>It is true that for all practical purposes all we have to do is check that the
                    conditions which allow us to use the two-sample t-test are met, lift the p-value
                    from the output, and draw our conclusions accordingly.</p>
                <p>However, we feel that it is important to mention the test statistic for two
                reasons:</p>
                <ol>
               <li> <p>The test statistic is what's behind the scenes; based on its null distribution
                    and its value, the p-value is calculated.</p></li>
             <li>   <p>Apart from being the key for calculating the p-value, the test statistic is
                    also itself a measure of the evidence stored in the data against H<sub>o</sub>. As we
                    mentioned, it measures (in standard errors) how different our data is from what
                    is claimed in the null hypothesis.</p></li></ol>
