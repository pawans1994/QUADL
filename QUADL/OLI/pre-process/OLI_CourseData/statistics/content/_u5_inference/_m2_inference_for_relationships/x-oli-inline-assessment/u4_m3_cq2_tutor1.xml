    <question id="q1">
        <body>A publishing company wanted to examine whether typing speeds differ when using word
                processor A, word processor B, and word processor C. The company tested the three
                word processors on three groups of 25 randomly selected typists (each group used one
                of the three word processors) and recorded the typing speed (in words per minute)
                for each typist. Which "case" does this study fall into?</body>

            <choice value="B">Comparing two means&#8212;matched pairs</choice>
            <choice value="C">Comparing more than two means&#8212;independent samples</choice>

                <feedback>Incorrect. While it is true that the samples in this example
                    are independent (since each was chosen randomly), note that more than two word
                    processors are compared here.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Note that more than two word processors are compared here. In
                        addition, note that the three samples were chosen randomly and are therefore
                        independent.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. In this situation, we are comparing the mean typing speed of
                        three (more than two) word processors, and since each of the three samples
                        was chosen randomly, they are independent. </feedback>
