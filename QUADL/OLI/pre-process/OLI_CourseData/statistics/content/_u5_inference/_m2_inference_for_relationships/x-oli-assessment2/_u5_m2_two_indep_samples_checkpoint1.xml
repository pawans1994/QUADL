        <body>A teacher is experimenting with a new computer-based instruction and conducts a study
            to test its effectiveness. In which situation could the teacher use the two-sample
            t-test for comparing two population means?</body>
        <input shuffle="false">
            <choice value="A">The teacher gives each student in the class a pretest. Then she
                teaches a lesson using a computer program. Afterwards, she gives each student a
                post-test. The teacher wants to compare test scores for each student to see whether
                the data will show an improvement.</choice>

                groups receives computer-based instruction and the other group receives traditional
                instruction without computers. After instruction, each student takes a test and the
                teacher wants to compare the test scores of the two groups.</choice>

                computer-based instruction. She asks students which they liked better. She wants to
