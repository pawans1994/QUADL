        <p>So far the researchers have observed linearity in the data, and based on a test concluded
            that this linear relationship between age and legibility distance can be generalized to
            the entire population of drivers.</p>
        <p>Since that is the case, the researchers would now like to estimate the equation of the
            straight line that governs the linear relationship between age and legibility distance
            among drivers. As we commented earlier, this is done by finding the line that best fits
            the pattern of our observed data. Recall that this line is called the least squares
            regression line, which is the line that minimizes the sum of the squared vertical
            deviations:</p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image148.gif" alt="A regression line has been drawn
on the histogram. From each point on the histogram a vertical line has been drawn to the regression line.
This vertical line makes up one side of a square, so that square's area is the vertical line squared.
So, for every point we have a square. The goal of the least squares regression line is to minimize the
area of all of the squares."/>
        <p>In the Exploratory Data Analysis section, we presented the actual formulas for the slope
            and intercept of the line. We are not going to repeat those here, we will obtain those
            values from the output:</p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image181.gif" alt="Regression Analysis: Distance vs. Age
    The regression equation is Distance = 577 - 3.01 Age
    Predictor: Constant: Coef = 576.68, SE Coef = 23.47, T = 24.57, P = 0.000
    Predictor: Age: Coef = -3.0068, SE Coef = 0.4243, T = -7.09, P = 0.000
    
    S = 49.7616, R-Sq = 64.2%, R-Sq(adj) = 62.9%"/>
        <p>and ask the software to plot it for us on the scatterplot so we can see how well it fits
            the data.</p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image149.gif" alt="A histogram with a regression line
drawn on top of it, titled &quot;Fitted Line Plot.&quot; The scatter plot is the same as the previous
scatter plot, with a vertical distance axis and horizontal age axis. The data shows a negative relationship,
and since it is roughly linear it is approximated well with the regression line."/>
        <p>Based on the observed data, the researchers conclude that the linear relationship between
            age and legibility distance among drivers can be summarized with the line:</p>
        <p>
            <em>DISTANCE = 576.7 - 3.007*AGE</em>
        </p>
        <p>In particular, the slope of the line is roughly -3, which means that for every year that
            a driver gets older (1 unit increase in X), the maximum legibility distance is reduced,
            on average, by 3 feet (Y changes by the value of the slope).</p>
        <p>The researchers can also use this line to make predictions, remembering to beware of
            extrapolations (predictions for X values that are outside of the range of the original
            data). For example, using the equation of the line, we predict that the maximum
            legibility distance of a 60-year-old driver is: <em>distance = 576.7 - 3.007(60) =
                396.28</em>. The following figure illustrates this prediction.</p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image150.gif" alt="The same histogram with regression line.
In order to find out what the maximum legibility distance of a 60-year-old driver is, we find where the
regression line crosses an imaginary vertical line at age=60. It crosses at (60, 396.28), so then we know
that the maximum legibility distance is 396.28 ."/>
        <p>Let's summarize all that the researchers have done in a figure:</p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image151.gif" alt="A large circle represents the population
of all drivers. The question we want to answer about the population is &quot;How is legibility distance
(Y) related to age (X)?&quot; To do this, we take an SRS of size 30, and from the data, create a scatterplot
and r. We observe that the scatterplot is linear and know that, calculate r = -0.8 . In the inference step,
we conclude that the evidence of linear relationship in the data is strong enough, allowing us to generalize
it to the population of all drivers. From the data, we estimate that the line that governs the relationship
in the population is: Distance = 577 - 3 * Age ."/>
