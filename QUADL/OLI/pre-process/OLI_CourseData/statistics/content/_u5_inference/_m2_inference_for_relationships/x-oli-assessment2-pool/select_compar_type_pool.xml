            <p>A teacher is experimenting with a new computer-based instruction and conducts a study
                to test its effectiveness. In which situation could the teacher use the two-sample
                t-test for comparing two population means?</p>
        </body>
        <input shuffle="true">
            <choice value="A">The teacher gives each student in the class a pretest. Then she
                teaches a lesson using a computer program. Afterwards, she gives each student a
                post-test. The teacher wants to compare test scores for each student to see whether
                the data will show an improvement.</choice>
            <choice value="B">The teacher randomly divides the class into two groups. One of the
                groups receives computer-based instruction and the other group receives traditional
                instruction without computers. After instruction, each student takes a test and the
                teacher wants to compare the test scores of the two groups.</choice>
            <choice value="C">The teacher uses a combination of traditional methods and
                computer-based instruction. She asks students which they liked better. She wants to
                determine if the majority prefer the computer-based instruction.</choice>

            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Since the same group of students was measured twice (once

                <feedback>Correct. Since students were randomized to two different groups, the data
                    obtained from this study should be analyzed using the two (independent) samples

                <feedback>Incorrect. The teacher collects data on the variable "liked computer-based
                    instruction better" (yes/no). With this data, the teacher could test a
                    hypothesis about a proportion.</feedback>

            <p>The owner of a test prep company was interested in whether students who took the
                company’s face to face test prep class did better on the GRE (a standardized test
                required for admission to many graduate programs) than students who followed the
                test prep company’s live online program. The live online test prep class met in an
                online classroom with live video instruction for the same number of hours as the
                face to face class. In which situation could the test prep company use the
                two-sample t-test for comparing two population means?</p>

                scores for each student to see whether the data will show an improvement.</choice>

                One of the groups receives the face to face test prep class and the other group
                receives the live online test prep class. After completing their test prep course,
                each student takes the GRE and the test prep company compares the test scores of the
                two groups.</choice>
            <choice value="C">The students take part of their GRE test prep course online and the
                remaining part in the face to face method. The test prep company asks the students
