            <p>(i) Survey random samples of 5 seniors, 5 juniors, 5 sophomores, and 5 freshmen, and
                get them to report the number of credits they are taking. Part-time students are
                included, so there are some extreme low outliers in the data.</p>
            <p>(ii) Survey random samples of 5 seniors, 5 juniors, 5 sophomores, and 5 freshmen, and
                get them to report the number of credits they are taking. Only full-time students
                are being considered, and the distributions do not display any

                <feedback>Correct. Indeed, this design should not be handled with ANOVA. The sample
                    sizes are quite low (all of size 5), and there is a violation of the normality
                    assumption in the form of extreme outliers.</feedback>

            <response match="B">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Note that in design (i), the sample sizes are quite low (all of
                    size 5), and there is a violation of the normality assumption in the form of
                    extreme outliers. In design (ii), the sample sizes are also small, but the data

                    not display any violation of the normality assumption, so ANOVA can be used.
