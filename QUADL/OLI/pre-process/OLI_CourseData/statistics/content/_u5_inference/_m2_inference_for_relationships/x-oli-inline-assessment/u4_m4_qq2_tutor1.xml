    <question id="q1">
        <body>We would like to see if the observed linear relationship between the damage caused by
            a fire and the distance the fire was from a fire station can be generalized to all
            fires. To test this, which of the following sets of hypotheses would you use?</body>
        <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
            <choice value="A">H<sub>0</sub>: There is a relationship between distance and damage,
                    H<sub>a</sub>: There is no relationship between distance and damage</choice>
            <choice value="B">H<sub>0</sub>: There is no relationship between distance and damage,
                    H<sub>a</sub>: There is a relationship between distance and damage</choice>
            <choice value="C">H<sub>0</sub>: There is a linear relationship between distance and
                damage, H<sub>a</sub>: There is no linear relationship between distance and damage</choice>
            <choice value="D">H<sub>0</sub>: There is no linear relationship between distance and
                damage, H<sub>a</sub>: There is a linear relationship between distance and damage</choice>
            <choice value="E">H<sub>0</sub>: Distance and damage are independent, H<sub>a</sub>:
                Distance and damage are dependent</choice>

                <feedback>Incorrect. We are looking for a specific relationship:
                    linear. Also, the hypothesis which indicates a relationship is the
                alternative.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. These hypotheses would be used for Case Câ†’C&#8212;two
