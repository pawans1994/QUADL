            <p>To determine whether there is a relationship between the type of school attended and
                verbal reasoning scores for Irish students, three samples with 25 students, in each
                group, were randomly selected from data used by Raferty and Hout (1985). One group
                of students attended secondary school, the second group of students attended
                vocational school, and the third group consisted of students who attended only
                primary school.</p>

            <p>A medical school admissions officer was interested in whether there is a difference
                in MCAT test scores (the standardized test used for medical school admission)
                between (1) biological sciences majors, (2) social science majors and (3) math
                majors. The admissions officer randomly sampled 50 students from each of these
                majors who applied to medical school in 2014 and recorded their MCAT score. </p>
            <p>The following hypotheses were tested:</p>
            <p>H<sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub> = μ<sub>2</sub> = μ<sub>3</sub></p>
            <p>H<sub>a</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub>, μ<sub>2</sub>, μ<sub>3</sub>, are not all equal</p>
            <p>The analysis was run on the data and the following output was obtained:</p>
