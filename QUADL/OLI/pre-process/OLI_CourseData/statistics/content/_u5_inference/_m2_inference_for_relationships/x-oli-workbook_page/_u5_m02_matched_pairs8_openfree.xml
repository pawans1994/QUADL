                <ul>
                    <li><p>The paired t-test is used to compare two population means when the two
                            samples (drawn from the two populations) are dependent in the sense that
                            every observation in one sample can be linked to an observation in the
                            other sample. Such a design is called "matched pairs."</p></li>
                    <li><p>The most common case in which the matched pairs design is used is when
                            the same subjects are measured twice, usually before and then after some
                            kind of treatment and/or intervention. Another classic case are studies
                            involving twins.</p></li>
                    <li><p>As in the "two independent samples" case, in the background, we have a
                            two-valued categorical explanatory whose categories define the two
                            populations we are comparing and whose effect on the response variable
                            we are trying to assess.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The idea behind the paired t-test is to reduce the data from two samples
                            to just one sample of the differences, and use these observed
                            differences as data for inference about a single mean &#8212; the mean
                            of the differences, <m:math overflow="scroll">
                                <m:mrow>
                                    <m:msub>
                                        <m:mi mathvariant="normal">μ</m:mi>
                                        <m:mi>d</m:mi>
                                    </m:msub>
                                </m:mrow>
                            </m:math>. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The paired t-test is therefore simply a one-sample t-test for the mean of
                            the differences <m:math overflow="scroll">
                                <m:mrow>
                                    <m:msub>
                                        <m:mi mathvariant="normal">μ</m:mi>
                                        <m:mi>d</m:mi>
                                    </m:msub>
                                </m:mrow>
                            </m:math>, where the null value is 0. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Once we verify that we can safely proceed with the paired t-test, we use
                            software output to carry it out.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A 95% confidence interval for <m:math overflow="scroll">
                                <m:mrow>
                                    <m:msub>
                                        <m:mi mathvariant="normal">μ</m:mi>
                                        <m:mi>d</m:mi>
                                    </m:msub>
                                </m:mrow>
                            </m:math> can be very insightful after a test has rejected the null
                            hypothesis, and can also be used for testing in the two-sided case. </p>
