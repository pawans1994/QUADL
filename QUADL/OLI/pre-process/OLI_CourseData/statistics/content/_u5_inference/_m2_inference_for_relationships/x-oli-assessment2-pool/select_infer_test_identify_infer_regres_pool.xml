            <p>We suspect that automobile insurance premiums (in dollars) may be steadily decreasing
                with the driver's driving experience (in years), so we choose a random sample of

                ages and insurance premiums.</p>

            <p>A group of student athletes was training for an obstacle course event by practicing a
                variety of exercises. Their coach wanted to know if the exercises were in fact
                related to their time to complete the obstacle course. Time 1 was each athlete’s
                time (in seconds) for 20 repetitions of shuttle runs (running back and forth between
                2 cones placed 25 meters apart) during training. Time 2 was the same athlete’s time
                (in seconds) to complete the obstacle course during the competition. If the coach
                wants to see if there was an association between time to complete 20 shuttle runs
                during training (in seconds) and the time to complete the obstacle course during
                competition (in seconds), which of the following is the appropriate inference method
                to analyze these data?</p>
