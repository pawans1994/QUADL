<question>
Does it matter which population we label as population 1 and which as population 2?


</question>
<answer> No<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T134939-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                it does not matter as long as you are
                consistent<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T134950-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                meaning that you do not switch labels in the middle. Keeping track of how you label
                the populations is important in stating the hypotheses and in the interpretation of
                the results. In our example, it would have been fine to make population 1 be the
                males, and population 2 be the females. (We'll say more about this in the Learn By
                Doing activity, where we'll learn to use software to perform this test). </answer>
