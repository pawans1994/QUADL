            <p>College Students and Drinking Habits: A public health official is studying
                differences in drinking habits among students at two different universities. They
                collect a random sample of students independently from each of the two universities
                and ask each student how many alcoholic drinks they consumed in the previous
                week.</p>
            <image src="../webcontent/chkpt_two_independent_samples/image1.png" />
            <p>The official conducts a two-sample t-test to determine whether these data provide
                significant evidence that students at University 1 drink more than students at
                University 2. The test statistic is t = 2.64 with a p-value 0.005.</p>
            <p>Which of the following is an appropriate conclusion?</p>

                there is a difference in drinking habits at the two universities.</choice>
            <choice value="C">We cannot use the t-test in this case because the variables (number of

            <p>A journalist is interested in whether there is a significant difference in the salary
                offered to electrical engineering and chemical engineering graduates at the
                University of Texas at Austin. She reviews the statistics for starting annual
                salaries for 2013–2014 and finds the following:</p>
