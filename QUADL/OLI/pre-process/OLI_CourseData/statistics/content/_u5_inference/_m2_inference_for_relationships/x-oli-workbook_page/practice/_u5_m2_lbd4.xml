        <p>The purpose of this activity is to give you guided practice in carrying out the paired
            t-test and to teach you how to obtain the paired t-test output using statistical
            software. Here is some background for the historically important data that we are going
            to work with in this activity.</p>

            <title>Background: Gosset's Seed Plot Data</title>
            <body>
                <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/image412.gif" alt="William S. Gosset"/>
                <p>William S. Gosset was employed by the Guinness brewing company of Dublin. Sample
                    sizes available for experimentation in brewing were necessarily small, and new
                    techniques for handling the resulting data were needed. Gosset consulted Karl
                    Pearson (1857-1936) of University College in London, who told him that the
                    current state of knowledge was unsatisfactory. Gosset undertook a course of
                    study under Pearson and the outcome of his study was perhaps the most famous
                    paper in statistical literature, "The Probable Error of a Mean" (1908), which
                    introduced the t distribution.</p>
                <p>Since Gosset was contractually bound by Guinness, he published under a pseudonym,
                    "Student"; hence, the t distribution is often referred to as <em style="italic"
                        >Student's t distribution</em>. </p>
                <p>As an example to illustrate his analysis, Gosset reported in his paper on the
                    results of seeding 11 different plots of land with two different types of seed:
                    regular and kiln-dried. There is reason to believe that drying seeds before
                    planting will increase plant yield. Since different plots of soil may be
                    naturally more fertile, this confounding variable was eliminated by using the
                    matched pairs design and planting both types of seed in all 11 plots.</p>
                <p>The resulting data (corn yield in pounds per acre) are as follows:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/image413.gif"
                    alt="A table with three columns,
labeled &quot;Plot,&quot; &quot;Regular seed,&quot; and &quot;Kiln-dried seed.&quot; Here is the data
in rows (Plot: Regular Seed, Kiln-dried Seed):
        1: 1903, 2009;
        2: 1935, 1915;
        3: 1910, 2011;
        4: 2496, 2463;
        5: 2108, 2180;
        6: 1961, 1925;
        7: 2060, 2122;
        8: 1444, 1482;
        9: 1612, 1542;
        10: 1316, 1443;
        11: 1511, 1535;"/>
                <p>We use these data to test the hypothesis that kiln-dried seed yields more corn
                    than regular seed. Here is a figure that summarizes this problem:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/image414.gif"
                    alt="Our categorical explanatory
variable is Seed Type (X), with categories regular and kiln dried. Using this, we create Population 1: plots
planted with regular seeds, and Population 2: plots planted with kiln-dried seeds. For each population,
there is a corn yield (Y) mean &mu;_1 and &mu;_2. When we create an SRS for each population, we are using
the same plots in both samples, thus using a matched pair design. Each SRS has a size 11."/>
                <p>Because of the nature of the experimental design (matched pairs), we are testing
                    the difference in yield.</p>
