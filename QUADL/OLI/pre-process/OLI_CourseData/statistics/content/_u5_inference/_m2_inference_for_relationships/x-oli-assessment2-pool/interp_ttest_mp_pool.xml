            <p>Some research suggests that first born children may have higher IQ scores than their
                later born siblings. Do first-born identical twins have higher IQ scores than their
                second-born sibling? Data from a 1998 study
                <!--by Tramo, Loftus, Stukel, Weaver, and
                Gazzaniga -->were analyzed
                to determine whether first-born identical twins have higher IQ scores than their
                second-born siblings. Ten pairs of adult identical twins were assessed and their
                Full Scale IQ scores were calculated.</p>

            <p>The director of a daycare center noticed that the infants were getting more diaper
                rashes than usual in the summer time. The policy of the center was to change the
                diapers on a schedule every three hours. The director wanted to find out if<!-- changing-->
                adjusting the diaper-changing schedule to every two hours would significantly reduce
                the number of diaper rashes. Since some of the infants seemed to have more sensitive
                skin, she decided to directly compare the number of diaper rashes for each
                individual infant when the diaper was changed every three hours versus every two
                hours. For the first week, the daycare center changed the diapers as usual every
                three hours and noted the number of days that each infant had symptoms of a diaper
                rash. During the second week, the teachers changed diapers every two hours and
                recorded the number of days with symptoms of a diaper rash. At the end of the two
                weeks, they compared for each individual infant the number of days with symptoms of
                a diaper rash when the diapers were changed every three hours versus every two

            <p>Developmental psychology researchers have shown a genetic influence of shyness in
                infants where infants who were adopted were more likely to be rated as shy at 2
                years of age if their biological mothers rated themselves as also being shy (Daniels
                &amp; Plomin, 1985). A researcher wanted to find out if this finding extended to
                shyness in identical twins. The researcher recruited a sample of 35 pairs of infants
                who were identical twins. The researcher asked the infants’ primary caregiver to
                rate each infant’s level of shyness and compared the shyness level between each
                identical twin to see if there was a mean difference in shyness between the pairs of
                identical twins. </p>

            <p>Research suggests that the pressure of being timed may interfere with performance on
                tests that involve mathematical problems. A fictional study was conducted with 30 sixth
                graders. First, the sixth graders were given a math test that contained 50 problems and
                were told that they had only one hour to complete it (timed condition). The same sixth
                graders were later given a math test that contained 50 problems and were told that they
                could have as much time, as needed, to complete the test (unlimited time condition). The
                total number of correct answers for each sixth grader was then calculated for each
                condition. Then, for each student, the difference between the two scores (timed − untimed)
                was calculated. The researchers hypothesized that the sixth graders would get fewer
                correct answers when they took the test with a time limit than when they had
                unlimited time.</p>

                <feedback>Correct. In order to reject the null hypothesis, the p-value must be below

                    hypothesis and conclude that sixth graders get, on average,
