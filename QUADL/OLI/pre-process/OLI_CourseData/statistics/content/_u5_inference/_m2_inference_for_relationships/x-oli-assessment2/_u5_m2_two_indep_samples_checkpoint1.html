			<body>A teacher is experimenting with a new computer-based instruction and conducts a

				two-sample t-test for comparing two population means?</body>
			<input shuffle="false">
				<choice value="A">The teacher gives each student in the class a pretest. Then she
					teaches a lesson using a computer program. Afterwards, she gives each student a
					post-test. The teacher wants to compare test scores for each student to see
					whether the data will show an improvement.</choice>
				<choice value="B">The teacher randomly divides the class into two groups. One of the
					groups receives computer-based instruction and the other group receives
					traditional instruction without computers. After instruction, each student takes
					a test and the teacher wants to compare the test scores of the two
					groups.</choice>
				<choice value="C">The teacher uses a combination of traditional methods and
					computer-based instruction. She asks students which they liked better. She wants
					to determine if the majority prefer the computer-based instruction.</choice>
			</input>

				<response match="A" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. Since the same group of students was measured twice (once

				<response match="B" score="10">
					<feedback>Good Job! Since students were <em style="italic">randomized</em> to two different groups the

				<response match="C" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect: The teacher collects data on the variable: &quot;liked

			<body><p>In a study of the impact of smoking on birth weight, researchers analyze birth
					weights (in grams) for babies born to 189 women who gave birth in 1989 at a
					hospital in Massachusetts. In the group, 74 were categorized as &quot;smokers&quot; and
					115 as &quot;non-smokers.&quot; The difference in mean birth weights (non-smokers minus
					smokers) is 281.7 grams with a margin of error of 205.2 grams with 95%
					confidence.</p>
				<p>Which gives the best interpretation of what we can conclude about the impact of
					smoking on birth weight?</p></body>
			<input shuffle="false">
				<choice value="A">We are 95% confident that on average, smoking causes lower birth
					weights of between 76.5 grams to 486.9 grams. </choice>
				<choice value="B">There is a 95% chance that if a woman smokes during pregnancy her
					baby will weigh between 76.5 grams to 486.9 grams less than if she did not
					smoke.</choice>
				<choice value="C">Smoking is associated with lower birth weights. When smokers are
					compared to non-smokers, we are 95% confident that the mean weight of babies of
					non-smokers is between 76.5 grams to 486.9 grams more than the mean weight of
					babies of smokers.</choice>
				<choice value="D">With such a large margin of error, this study does not suggest

				<response match="A" score="0">
					<feedback>Not quite right: this study is an observational study. We cannot make
						cause-and-effect statements from an observational study. We could say &quot;We
						are 95% confident that smoking is associated with birth weights that are

						C.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="B" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect: The 95% confidence is not a statement about an individual

						smoking women. The correct answer is C.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="C" score="10">
					<feedback>Correct. This study is an observational study, so the use of the

						confident&quot; with a specific confidence interval is also appropriate.
					</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="D" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect: The interval does not contain zero, so the interval does
