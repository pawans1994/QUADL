  <question id="q1">
    <body>Based on the output and the corresponding conclusion, which of the following is a
      plausible 95% confidence interval for the difference &#956;<sub>1</sub> - &#956;<sub>2</sub>?</body>
    <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
      <choice value="A">(a) (0.35, 3.03)</choice>
      <choice value="B">(b) (-3.03, -0.35)</choice>

        <feedback>Incorrect. The confidence interval most likely contains the true
          value of the difference being hypothesized about, i.e., the confidence interval should
          contain the value of &#956;<sub>1</sub> - &#956;<sub>2</sub>. So, since we didn’t reject the null hypothesis, the interval in
          this case should contain <em>zero</em>, because we believe the null hypothesis (i.e., we believe
          that &#956;<sub>1</sub> - &#956;<sub>2</sub> = 0). But notice that the interval in (a) does not contain zero, because both endpoints
          of the interval are positive.</feedback>
