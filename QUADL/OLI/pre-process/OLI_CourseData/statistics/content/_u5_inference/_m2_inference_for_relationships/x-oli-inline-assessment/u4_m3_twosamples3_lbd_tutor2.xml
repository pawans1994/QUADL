          Since the sample sizes (191 and 209) are large, we can proceed with the two-sample t-test
          regardless of whether the populations are normal or not. (and, thus, there is no need to
          look at the data using a histogram). In conclusion, we can reliably use the two-sample
          t-test in this case.</p>
