            <p>Here are the standard deviations:</p>

            <p>Let's check the conditions:</p>
            <p>(i) We are told that the sample was chosen at random, so the three eye-color samples
              are independent.</p>
            <p>(ii) The sample sizes are quite low, but the boxplots do not display any extreme
              violation of the normality assumption in the form of extreme skewness or outliers.</p>
            <p>(iii) We can assume that the equal population standard deviation condition is met,
              since the rule of thumb is satisfied (1.843 / 1.365 is less than 2)</p>

            <p>In summary, we can safely proceed with the ANOVA F-test.</p>
