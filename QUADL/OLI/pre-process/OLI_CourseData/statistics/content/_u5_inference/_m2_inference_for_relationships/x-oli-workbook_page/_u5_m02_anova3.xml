Business majors, the first quartile is at about 2, and the third quartile is at about 17. The rest
of the majors have smaller ranges, but they are still large, covering 10 or more frustration points. 
The mean for business is about 9, for English 12, mathematics 13, and psychology about a 13. Every majors'
mean is in the interval of every other major's first and third quartiles."/>

the interval between the first and third quartile for each major is much narrower - the worse case is about 7.
In addition, we also see that while the means for each major are the same as in the first set of box plots,
the box plot for business does not contain any other major's mean in its first and third quartile interval.
We also see that no other majors' first and third quartile interval includes business's mean. In fact,
they don't even include its third quartile."/>

                <p>The important difference between the two scenarios is that the first represents
                    data with a large amount of variation within each of the four groups; the second
                    represents data with a small amount of variation within each of the four
                    groups.</p>

                    because of the large amount of spread within the groups, shows boxplots with
                    plenty of overlap. One could imagine the data arising from 4 random samples
                    taken from 4 populations, all having the same mean of about 11 or 12. The first
                    group of values may have been a bit on the low side, and the other three a bit
                    on the high side, but such differences could conceivably have come about by
                    chance. This would be the case if the null hypothesis, claiming equal population
                    means, were true. Scenario

                    equal population means. This would be the case if the null hypothesis, claiming
                    equal population means, were false.</p>
                <p>Thus, in the language of hypothesis tests, we would say that if the data were
                    configured as
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232303-0500"?>they are
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>in
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232307-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232307-0500" content="S"?>cenario
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232310-0500" content="#"?>1, we
                    would not reject the null hypothesis that population mean frustration levels
                    were equal for the four majors. If the data were configured as
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232356-0500"?>they are
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>in
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232400-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232400-0500" content="S"?>cenario
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232404-0500" content="#"?>2, we
                    would reject the null hypothesis, and we would conclude that mean frustration
                    levels differ, depending on major.</p>
                <p>Let's summarize what we learned from this. The question we need to answer is: Are
                    the differences among the sample means (<m:math overflow="scroll">
                        <m:mrow>
                            <m:mover>
                                <m:mi>Y</m:mi>
                                <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
                            </m:mover>
                        </m:mrow>
                    </m:math>'s) due to true differences among the μ's (alternative hypothesis), or
                    merely due to sampling variability (null hypothesis)? </p>
                <p>In order to answer this question using our data, we obviously need to look at the
                    variation among the sample means, but this alone is not enough. We need to look
                    at the variation among the sample means relative to the variation within the
                    groups. In other
                    words<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232447-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    we need to look at the quantity:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image163.gif" alt="variation among sample means /
variation within groups"/>
                <p>which measures to what extent the difference among the sampled groups' means
                    dominates over the usual variation within sampled groups (which reflects
                    differences in individuals that
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232524-0500"?>are<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232524-0500" content="is"?>
                    typical in random samples).</p>
                <p>When the variation within groups is large (like in
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232535-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232534-0500" content="S"?>cenario
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232623-0500" content="#"?>1),
                    the variation (differences) among the sample means could become negligible and
                    the data
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232547-0500"?>provide<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232545-0500" content="have"?>
                    very little evidence against
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232605-0500"?>H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232603-0500" content="Ho"?>.
                    When the variation within groups is small (like in
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232615-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232614-0500" content="S"?>cenario
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232619-0500" content="#"?>2),
                    the variation among the sample means dominates over it, and the data have
                    stronger evidence
                    against<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232756-0500"?>
                        H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T232630-0500" content=" Ho"?>.</p>
                <p>Looking at this ratio of variations is the idea behind the comparing more than
                    two means; hence the name analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p>
                <p>Now that we understand the idea behind the ANOVA F-test, let's move on to step 2.
                    We'll start by talking about the test statistic, since it will be a natural
                    continuation of what we've just discussed, and then move on to talk about the
                    conditions under which the ANOVA F-test can be used. In practice, however, the
                    conditions need to be checked first, as we did before.</p>
