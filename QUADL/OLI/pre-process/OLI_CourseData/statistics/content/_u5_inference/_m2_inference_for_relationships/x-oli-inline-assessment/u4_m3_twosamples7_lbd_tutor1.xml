                <p>Based on the magnitude of the p-value shown in the output (p-value = .210), we <em>do
                    not reject the null hypothesis</em> (since the p-value is relatively large). </p>
                <p> This means that the study does not provide sufficient evidence that the average
                    sugar content of all fruit juices sold is any different than the average sugar
                    content of all sodas.</p>

                    up remarks: The conclusion is interesting for two reasons. First, we might have
                    initially suspected (prior to the study) that sodas would have
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T172929-0500"?>a
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>higher average sugar content than juices; but the formal
                    inference shows that this supposition is not supported. Second, after seeing the
                    summary statistics (but not the inference), we saw that the sample of juices
                    actually had slightly higher average sugar content than the sodas, so we might
                    have then wondered if juices overall actually have
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T172957-0500"?>a
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>higher average sugar content than sodas; but the inferential
                    conclusion shows that this is not supported
                    either.<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T172919-0500" content="}"?>
