            <p>Do oddsmakers believe that teams who play at home will have home field advantage?
                Specifically, do oddsmakers give higher point spreads when the favored team plays
                home games as compared to when the favored team plays away games?</p>
            <p>Two samples were randomly selected from three complete National Football League
                seasons (1989, 1990, and 1991). The first sample consisted of 50 games, where the
                favored team played in a home game, while the second sample consisted of 50 games,
                where the favored team played in an away game. The oddsmakers’ point spreads (which
                are the number of points by which the favored team is predicted to beat the weaker
                team) were then collected.</p>
            <p>The following hypotheses were tested:</p>
            <p>H<sub>0</sub>: µ<sub>1</sub> = µ<sub>2</sub></p>
            <p>H<sub>a</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub> &gt; μ<sub>2</sub></p>
            <p>Analyses were run. The following is the (edited) output for the test:</p>

            <p>Do college students who are in a fraternity or sorority attend more parties than
                college students who are not affiliated with a fraternity or sorority? A statistics

                students who were not affiliated with a fraternity or sorority and asked them to
