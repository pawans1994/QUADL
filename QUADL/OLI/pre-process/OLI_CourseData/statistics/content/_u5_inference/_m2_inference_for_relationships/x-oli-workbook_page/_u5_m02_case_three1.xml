    <p>In inference for relationships, so far we have learned inference procedures for both cases
                            C→Q and C→C from the role/type classification table below. The last case
                            to be considered in this course is

                            section, we examined the relationship between sample values for two
                            quantitative variables by looking at a scatterplot and focused on the
                            linear relationship by supplementing the scatterplot with the
                            correlation coefficient r.</p>
<p>There was no attempt made to claim that whatever relationship was observed in the sample necessarily held for the larger population from which the sample originated. Now that we have a better understanding of the process of statistical inference, we will present the method for inferring something about the relationship between two quantitative variables in an entire population, based on the relationship seen in the sample. In particular, the method will focus on <em>linear </em>relationships and will answer the following question: Is the observed linear relationship due to a true linear relationship between two variables in the population, or could it be that we obtained this kind of pattern in the data just by chance?</p>
<p>If we conclude that we can generalize the observed linear relationship to the entire population,
                            we will then use the data to estimate the line that governs the linear
                            relationship between the two variables in the population, and use it to
                            make predictions. The following figure summarizes this

<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image146.gif" alt="We represent our population of interest with
a large circle. The question we which want to answer about the population is &quot;Are the two quantitative
variables X and Y related?&quot; To answer this, we take an SRS of size n, generating our data. The data
is summarized with a scatterplot and r, and we observe the linearity of the relationship between X and Y.
Then, in the inference step we ask ourselves &quot;is the evidence of linear relationship in the data
strong enough that we can generalize it to the entire population?&quot; If it is strong enough, we use the
data to estimate the lne that governs the relationship between X and Y in the populations."/>

<p>1. We estimate the line that governs the linear relationship between X and Y in the population by
                            the line that best fits the linear pattern in our observed data. Recall
                            that in the
                            E<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T172902-0500"?>xploratory

                            least squares regression line actually belongs to the inference unit,
                            and while it is true that it is the line that best fits (in some sense)
                            the observed data, it is really an estimate of the true linear
                            relationship that exists in the population. The good thing is that we
                            already learned how to obtain this line, so we'll only need to review
                            it.</p>
<p>2. This section on regression will be very qualitative in nature and will rely mostly on
                            conceptual ideas and on output.
