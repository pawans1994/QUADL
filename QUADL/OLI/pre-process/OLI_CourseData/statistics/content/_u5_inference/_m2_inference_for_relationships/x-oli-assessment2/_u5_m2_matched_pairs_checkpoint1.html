		<p>Research suggests that the pressure of being timed may interfere with performance on
			tests that involve mathematical problems. A fictional study was conducted with 30 6th
			graders. First, the 6th graders were given a math test that contained 50 problems and
			were told that they had only one hour to complete it (Timed Condition). The same 6th
			graders were later given a math test that contained 50 problems and were told that they
			could have as much time, as needed, to complete the test (Unlimited Time Condition). The
			total number of correct answers for each 6th grader was then calculated for each
			condition. Then, for each student, the difference between the two scores (Timed-Untimed)
			was calculated. The researchers hypothesized that the 6th graders would get fewer
			correct answers, when they took the test with a time limit, as compared to when they had
			unlimited time. </p>
