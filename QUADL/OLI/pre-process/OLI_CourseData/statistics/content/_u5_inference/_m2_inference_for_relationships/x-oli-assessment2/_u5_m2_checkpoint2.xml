                        state, the higher the death rate. Note that since the response variable is
                        the mortality per 10 million, it measures the death rate rather than the

                        expected counts for Hispanic males is larger than 5) and the expected counts
                        are the counts that we would expect to see if the null hypothesis of the
                        chi-square test were true. However, calculating the expected count is not
                        dependent on meeting the conditions of the chi-square procedure.
                        Additionally, the expected count does not rely on the assumption that the
                        categories related, but rather the opposite. </feedback>
