        <p>So far, we have discussed and illustrated cases in which the matched pairs design comes
            up, and we are now ready to discuss how to carry out the test in this case. We will
            first present the idea behind the paired t-test, and then go through the four steps in
            the testing process.</p>

                    <body>
                        <p>The idea behind the paired t-test is to reduce this two-sample situation,
                            where we are comparing two means, to a single sample situation where we
                            are doing inference on a single mean, and then use a simple t-test that
                            we introduced in the previous module. We will first illustrate this idea
                            using our example, and then more generally.</p>

                        <p>In other words, by reducing the two samples to one sample of differences,
                            we are essentially reducing the problem from a problem where we're
                            comparing two means (i.e., doing inference on <m:math overflow="scroll">

we generate the SRS of size 20 for population 2 after giving them 2 beers."/>

                        <p>In general, in every matched pairs problem, our data consist of 2 samples
