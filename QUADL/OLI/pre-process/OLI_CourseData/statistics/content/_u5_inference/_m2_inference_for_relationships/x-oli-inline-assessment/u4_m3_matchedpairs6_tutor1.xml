        <body>As we saw, the p-value of the test H<sub>0</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub> = 0 vs.
                H<sub>a</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub> &#8800; 0 is 0.074. This means that if we had
            carried out the one-sided test H<sub>0</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub> = 0 vs. H<sub>a</sub>:
                &#956;<sub>d</sub> &lt; 0, the p-value would have been:</body>
        <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
            <choice value="A">0.074 (the same)</choice>
            <choice value="B">0.148 (double)</choice>
            <choice value="C">0.037 (half)</choice>

            <response match="A">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The p-value of the one-sided test is not the same
                    as the p-value of the two-sided test. Ask for a hint to get more details and try
                    again.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The p-value of the one-sided test is not the
                    double the p-value of the two-sided test. Ask for a hint to get more details and
                    try again.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. The p-value of the one-sided test is half the p-value of
                    the two-sided test.</feedback>
            </response>
            <hint>Recall that the name "two-sided" reminds us that the p-value of this test is
                comprised of two tail probabilities, while the p-value of the one-sided test is
                comprised of just one of them. Click <link
