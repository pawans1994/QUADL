        assume that the observations are independent. To get this information, click <link

        <p>Let's start with the issue of independence: According to the paper, the 38 infants were a
          sample of infants born at the Long Island Jewish Hospital at the time of the study. Given
          this information, we can assume that the observations are independent (even though it
          doesn't explicitly say that the sample was random). The only

          that the independence assumption would be violated is if twins (or triplets<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T203212-0500"?>
          <?oxy_insert_end?>...<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T203214-0500" content="."?>)
          were included in the study, which

          was not the case.</p>
        <p>Comment: Even though the sample was chosen from a specific hospital (rather than from the
          "entire population of infants"), unless the infants who were born in this specific
          hospital at the time of the study were systematically different from infants in general in
          some relevant way, it will still be reasonable to attempt to generalize the results to
          infants in general. As for the other conditions: The relationship seems linear (even
          though it is moderately weak), the scatterplot does not display any alarming outliers, and
          the sample size is reasonably large (n<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T203314-0500"?>
