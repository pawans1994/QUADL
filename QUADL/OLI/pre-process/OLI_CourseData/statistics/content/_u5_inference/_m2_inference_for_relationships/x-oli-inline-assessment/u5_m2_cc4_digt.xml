                <p>A chi-square test regarding the relationship between participation in the 9/11
                    rescue and risk of alcohol problems among New York firefighters and first
                    responders produced the following results:</p>
                <!--  <image src="../webcontent/_u5_m2_cc4digt.gif"/>-->
                <p>Based on the p-value results and a significance level of 0.05, which of the
                    following is an appropriate conclusion?</p>

                        than 0.05. In addition, the null hypothesis being assessed is that there is
                        no relationship between the two categorical variables: risk of alcohol
                        problems and being a 9/11 first responder.</feedback>

                <response match="C" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. In order to reject the null hypothesis of no relationship
                        between two categorical variables, the p-value must be less than 0.05. The
                        calculated p-value of 0.0004 is less than 0.05; therefore, the null
                        hypothesis should be rejected and the conclusion drawn that there is a
                        relationship between alcohol problems in New York firefighters and
                        participation in the 9/11 rescue.</feedback>

                <response match="D" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. It is correct that the null hypothesis should be rejected,
                        because the calculated p-value of 0.0004 is less than the significance level
                        of 0.05. However, the <em style="italic">null hypothesis</em> being assessed
                        is that there is no relationship between the two categorical variables: risk
                        of alcohol problems and being a 9/11 first responder.</feedback>
