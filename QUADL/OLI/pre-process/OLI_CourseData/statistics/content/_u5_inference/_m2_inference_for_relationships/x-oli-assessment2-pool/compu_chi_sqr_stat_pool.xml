            <p>To determine if there is a relationship between grade performance and extracurricular
                participation, North Carolina State conducted a study of 112 students, recording the
                number of students in each of three extracurricular categories, and each of two
                grade categories. Here are the results: <image style="block" src="../webcontent/assessment9q18image1.gif" /> Source:

                    Proceedings</em>, pp. 1516–1519.</p>
            <p>Which one of the following facts should make you the most worried about the
                reliability of the results of the test in this case?</p>
        </body>
        <input labels="false" shuffle="true">
            <choice value="A">The 112 students were all students in a chemical engineering course
                and not a random sample from the entire student body.</choice>
            <choice value="B">Two of the observed counts are less than 5.</choice>
            <choice value="C">Not all of the cells' contributions to the chi-squared statistic are
                greater than 1.</choice>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Although these students are all from the same course, they are
                    still randomly chosen.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The observed counts being less than 5 is not the most worrisome
                    issue.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. This just implies that some cells have expected counts and
                    observed counts that are very close in value.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="D" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. Since two of the six (or 33% of the) expected counts are less
                    than 5. we should be concerned about the reliability of the results of the test.
                    The fact that the random sample was not taken from among the entire university’s
                    students but from a smaller sampling frame of students in a chemical engineering
                    course should not harm the reliability of the test results (since the sample is
                    still random) but should just affect how general our conclusions can
                    be.</feedback>
