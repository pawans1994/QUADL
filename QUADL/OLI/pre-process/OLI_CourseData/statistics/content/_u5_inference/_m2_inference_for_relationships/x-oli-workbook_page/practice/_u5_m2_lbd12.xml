        <title>Case Q→Q</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to give you guided practice in testing whether the data
            provide evidence of a significant linear relationship, and in verifying that the basic
            conditions under which the results of such a test are reliable are met.</p>
        <p>Recall the example from the previous activity:</p>
        <p>A method for predicting IQ as soon as possible after birth could be important for early
            intervention in cases such as brain abnormalities or learning disabilities. It has been
            thought that greater infant vocalization (for instance, more crying) is associated with
            higher IQ. In 1964, a study was undertaken to see if IQ at 3 years of age is associated
            with amount of crying at newborn age. In the study, 38 newborns were made to cry after
            being tapped on the foot and the number of distinct cry vocalizations within 20 seconds
            was counted. The subjects were followed up at 3 years of age and their IQs were
            measured.</p>
