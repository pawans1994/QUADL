                saving money and eliminating debt. The researcher compared the scores of each member
                of the engaged couple to see if there was a mean difference in the couples’
                attitudes towards saving money and eliminating debt. </choice>
            <choice value="B">A biologist was interested in finding out whether rats who are
                littermates (siblings who are born at the same time) have similar abilities when
                learning how to run a maze. The biologists selected 50 pairs of littermates and
                tested how many trials it took for the rat to get to the end of the maze in less
                than 10 seconds. The null hypothesis was that there would be no mean difference in
                the number of trials that the rat and their litter mate would take to complete the
                maze in under 10 seconds. Each rat’s maze time was compared to his/her littermate. </choice>
            <choice value="C">A medical researcher believes that a new drug will increase a
                patient’s red blood cell count at a higher rate than that achieved by an old drug
                currently in use. The researcher randomly assigns 50 patients to be in the “new
                drug” group and 50 patients to be in the “old drug” group, then compares the mean
                red blood cell count for the “new drug” group to the red blood cell count of the
                “old drug” group. </choice>
            <choice value="D">A researcher is interested in determining the effects of caffeine on
                manual dexterity. The researcher recruits a sample of 60 participants and asks each
                participant to complete a manual dexterity task similar to the game “Operation.”
                Each participant completes the task twice: On Day 1, participants complete the task when
                they have not consumed any caffeine for at least 6 hours. On Day 2, the participants
                drink a beverage with 200 mg of caffeine 20 minutes before completing the task. The
                researcher compares each individual’s number of errors in the task with and without
                caffeine exposure and computes a mean difference. </choice>
