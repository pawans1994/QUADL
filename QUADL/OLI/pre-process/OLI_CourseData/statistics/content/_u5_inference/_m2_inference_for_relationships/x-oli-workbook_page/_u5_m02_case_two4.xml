            <title>Step 3: Finding the p-value</title>
            <body>
                <p>The p-value for the chi-square test for independence is the probability of
                    getting counts like those observed, assuming that the two variables are not
                    related (which is what is claimed by the null hypothesis). The smaller the
                    p-value, the more surprising it would be to get counts like we did, if the null
                    hypothesis were true.</p>
                <p>Technically, the p-value is the probability of observing <m:math

            <title> Step 4: Stating the conclusion in context</title>
            <body>
                <p>As usual, we use the magnitude of the p-value to draw our conclusions. A small
                    p-value indicates that the evidence provided by the data is strong enough to
                    reject H<sub>o</sub> and conclude (beyond a reasonable doubt) that the two
                    variables are related. In particular, if a significance level of .05 is used, we
                    will reject H<sub>o</sub> if the p-value is less than .05.</p>
            </body>
        </section>
        <example>

            <p>A p-value of .201 is not small at all. There is no compelling statistical evidence to
                reject H<sub>o</sub>, and so we will continue to assume it may be true. Gender and
                drunk driving may be independent, and so the data suggest that a law that forbids
                sale of 3.2% beer to males and permits it to females is unwarranted. In fact, the
                Supreme Court, by a 7-2 majority, struck down the Oklahoma law as discriminatory and
                unjustified. In the majority opinion Justice Brennan wrote
                (http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/craig.html):</p>
            <p>"Clearly, the protection of public health and safety represents an important function
                of state and local governments. However, appellees' statistics in our view cannot
                support the conclusion that the gender-based distinction closely serves to achieve
                that objective and therefore the distinction cannot under [prior case law] withstand
                equal protection challenge."</p>

                    evidence they carry. Let's take the previous example and simply multiply each of
                    the counts by 3:</p>

in which the columns are labeled &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; (categories of Drank Alcohol

data in the table, given in cell format (&quot;Row, Column: Value&quot;):

                <p>In other words, the sample provides the "same" results, but this time they are
                    based on a much larger sample (1857 instead of 619). This is reflected by the
                    chi-square test. In this case, software gives us a chi-square statistic of 4.910
                    and a p-value of 0.027.</p>
                <p>As before, H<sub>o</sub> states that gender and drunk driving are not related;
                        H<sub>a</sub> states that they are related. Since the observed counts are
                    triple what they were before, the expected counts are also tripled. When done
                    with software the original chi-square statistic was 1.637 since software doesn't
                    round as much. The chi-square statistic when we tripled the data is 3 times
                    1.637, or 4.91 (which now is in the "large" range). Therefore, the p-value is
                    smaller and is now .027.</p>

                <p>Now, we do reject H<sub>o</sub>, and we conclude that gender and drunk driving
                    are related. In this case, the "largest contribution to chi-square" is large
                    enough to provide evidence of a relationship. This is due to the fact that so
                    few females drove drunk (48) compared to the number that would be expected
                    (62.2, which is 414 * 279 / 1857) if the variables gender and drunk driving were
                    not related. This contribution is <m:math overflow="scroll">
