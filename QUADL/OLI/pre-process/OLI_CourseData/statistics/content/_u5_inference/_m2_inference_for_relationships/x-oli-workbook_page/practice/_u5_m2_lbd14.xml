        <title>Two Independent Samples</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p> The purpose of this activity is to help you practice the connection between the two
            branches of formal inference (significance testing and confidence intervals) in the
            context of two independent samples. </p>
        <p>
            <em>Background: </em></p>
        <p> Fruit juice is often marketed as being a healthier alternative to soda. And although
            juice does contain vitamins, juice can also be surprisingly high in sugar. Since excess
            sugar from any source can play a role in diseases like obesity and diabetes, it is
            important to be quantitatively informed about the beverages we consume. </p>
        <p> To compare the <em>sugar content</em> (in grams) between <em>soda</em> and <em>100%
                fruit juice</em>, an investigation was made of <em>34</em> representative popular
            U.S. brands of 100% bottled juice (such as Dole, Minute Maid, Motts, Juicy Juice, Ocean
            Spray, Tree Top Apple, V8 Fusion, and Welch’s Grape), and <em>45</em> representative
            popular U.S. brands of soda pop (such as 7-Up, A&amp;W Root Beer, Coca-Cola, Crush, Dr.
            Pepper, Fanta, Hawaiian Punch, Pepsi Cola, RC Cola, Sierra Mist, Schweppes Ginger Ale,
            and Sprite). </p>
        <p> (Note, these are real data.) </p>
        <p>
            <em>Hypotheses: </em></p>
        <p> If we let &#956;<sub>1</sub> represent the mean sugar content of the population of all
            bottled 100% fruit juices on the market, and if we let &#956;<sub>2</sub> represent the
            mean sugar content of the population all sodas on the market, then the significance test
            of interest are the hypotheses: </p>
        <p> Null hypothesis: &#956;<sub>1</sub> - &#956;<sub>2</sub> = 0</p>
        <p> (in other words, that there is no difference between the overall mean sugar content of
            on-the-market juices and on-the-market sodas, i.e., that the two beverage categories
            have the same overall mean sugar content). </p>
        <p> Alternative hypothesis: &#956;<sub>1</sub> - &#956;<sub>2</sub> &#8800; 0</p>
        <p> (in other words, that there is a difference between the overall mean sugar content of
            on-the-market juices and on-the-market sodas, i.e., that the two beverage categories
            don’t have the same overall mean sugar content). </p>
        <p>
            <em>Summary statistics:</em>
        </p>
        <p> The summary of sugar content (in grams) for the two samples is as follows (remember,
            these are real data): </p>

        <image src="../../webcontent/image500.png"
            alt="Fruit Juice: N = 34, Mean = 30.38, StDev = 7.12, SE Mean = 1.2
        Soda: N = 45, Mean = 28.69, StDev = 3.53, SE Mean = 0.53"/>


        <p> We see that the sample mean sugar content of the 34 juices was actually higher, at 30.38
            grams, while the sample mean sugar content of the 45 sodas was only 28.69 grams. </p>
        <p> The inferential question of interest is whether the slight difference is statistically
            significant. </p>
        <p>
            <em>Checking conditions for inference: </em></p>
        <p> For the purpose of statistical inference, we will consider the drinks in the study to be
                <em>random samples</em> of all such drinks on the market. </p>
        <p> There are two independent groups (fruit juice versus soda); and since the sigmas (the
            standard deviations of the populations) are unknown to us, our required test will be a
                <em>t-test for two independent means</em>. </p>
        <p> To check that a t-test for two independent means is reasonably justified, we should
            consider the shape of the histograms as well as the sample sizes in the study. </p>
        <p> The histograms of sugar content for the two groups are as follows: </p>


        <image src="../../webcontent/image502.gif"
            alt="Two histograms of sugar per serving (grams). The
vertical axis is for Frequency, and the horizontal axis is for Sugar Per Serving (grams). There is one
histogram each for Fruit Juice and for Soda."/>



        <p> The histogram of sugar content for the <em>soda</em> sample (the graph on the right) is
            clearly unimodal and symmetric without any outliers; that shape helps to justify the
            desired inference procedure. The histogram of sugar content for the <em>juice</em>
            sample (the graph on the left) isn’t quite as nice from the standpoint of justifying
            inference, since it’s less clearly unimodal (although still clearly symmetric) and it
            has one possible outlier on its left side (although not too severe an outlier); but
            since the sample sizes in the study were each relatively large (n<sub>1</sub> =
                <em>34</em> brands of juice and n<sub>2</sub> = <em>44</em> brands of soda) the
            t-test is still justified, despite the possible bimodality and possible (and
            not-too-severe) outlier of the juice sample. </p>
        <p>
            <em>Result of Inference: </em></p>
        <p> Here is the output from the formal t-test for two independent means: </p>


        <image src="../../webcontent/image501.png"
            alt="Difference = mu (Fruit Juice) - mu (Soda)
    Estimate for difference: 1.69
    T-Test of difference = 0 (vs not =): T-Value = 1.27, P-Value = 0.210, DF = 45"/>
