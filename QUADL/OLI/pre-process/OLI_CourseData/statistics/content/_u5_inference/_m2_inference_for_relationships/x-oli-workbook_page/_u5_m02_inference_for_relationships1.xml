        <p>In the previous two modules we performed inference for one variable. More specifically,
            we learned about inference for the population proportion p (when the variable of
            interest is categorical) and inference for the population mean μ (when the variable of
            interest is quantitative). In the previous two modules we were also exposed to the
            following three forms of inference which will continue to be central as we move forward
            in the course:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em style="bold">Point estimation</em>—estimating an unknown parameter with a single
                value that is computed from the sample.</li>
            <li><em style="bold">Interval estimation</em>—estimating an unknown parameter by an
                interval of plausible values. To each such interval we attach a level of confidence
                that indeed the interval captures the value of the unknown parameter and hence the
                name confidence intervals. </li>
            <li><em style="bold">Hypothesis testing</em>—a four-step process in which we are
                assessing evidence provided by the data in favor or against some claim about the
                population parameter.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- <p>In the previous two modules, we learned to perform inference for a single categorical or
            quantitative variable in the form of point estimation, confidence intervals or
            hypothesis testing. The inference was actually about the population proportion (when the
            variable of interest was categorical) and about the population mean (when the variable
            of interest was quantitative).</p>
             -->
        <p>Our next (and final) goal for this course is to perform inference about relationships
            between two variables in a population, based on an observed relationship between
            variables in a sample. Here is what the process looks like:</p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image001.gif" alt="A large circle represents the
Population of Interest. We are interested in whether X and Y are related in the population. To
figure this out, we take a SRS of size n, represented by a smaller circle. This is the data that we
use to perform inference. Based on the observed data, do we have significant evidence that X and Y
are related?"/>
        <p>We are interested in studying whether a relationship exists between the variables X and Y
            in a population of interest. We choose a random sample and collect data on both
            variables from the subjects. Our goal is to determine whether these data provide strong
            enough evidence for us to generalize the observed relationship in the sample and
            conclude (with some acceptable and agreed-upon level of uncertainty) that a relationship
            between X and Y exists in the entire population.</p>
        <p>The primary inference form that we will use in this module, then, is hypothesis testing.
            Conceptually, across all the inferential methods that we will learn, we'll test some
            form of:</p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image002.gif" alt="H_0: There is no relationship
between X and Y.  H_a: There is a significant relationship between X and Y."/>
        <p>(We will also discuss point and interval estimation, but our discussion about these forms
            of inference will be framed around the test.)</p>
        <p>Recall that in the module about examining the relationship between two variables in the
            Exploratory Data Analysis unit, our discussion was framed around the role-type
            classification table. This part of the course will be structured exactly in the same
            way.</p>
        <p>In other words, we will go through 3 sections corresponding to cases C→Q, C→C, and Q→Q in
            the table below.</p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image003.gif" alt="It is possible
for any type of explanatory variable to be paired with any type of response variable.
The possible pairings are:
Categorical Explanatory → Categorical Response (C→C),
Categorical Explanatory → Quantitative Response (C→Q),
Quantitative Explanatory → Categorical Response (Q→C), and
Quantitative Explanatory → Quantitative Response (Q→Q)."/>
        <p>(Recall that case Q→C is not discussed in this course.)</p>
        <p>In total, we will introduce 5 inferential methods: three in case C→Q (corresponding to a
            division of this case into 3 sub-cases) and one in each of the cases C→C and Q→Q.</p>
        <p>Unlike the previous part of the course on Inference for One Variable, where we discussed
            in some detail the theory behind the machinery of the test (such as the null
            distribution of the test statistic, under which the p-values are calculated), in the 5
            inferential procedures that we will introduce in Inference for Relationships, we will
            discuss much less of that kind of detail. The principles are the same, but the details
            behind the null distribution of the test statistic (under which the p-value is
            calculated) become more complicated and require knowledge of theoretical results that
            are definitely beyond the scope of this course.</p>
        <p>Instead, within each of the five inferential methods we will focus on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When the inferential method is appropriate for use.</li>
            <li>Under what conditions the procedure can safely be used.</li>
            <li>The conceptual idea behind the test (as it is usually captured by the test
                statistic).</li>
            <li>How to use software to carry out the procedure in order to get the p-value of the
                test.</li>
            <li>Interpreting the results in the context of the problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, we will continue to introduce each test according to the four-step process of
            hypothesis testing. We are now ready to start with Case C→Q.</p>
