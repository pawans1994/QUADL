            <p>To determine the relative effectiveness of different study strategies for the SAT,
                suppose three groups of students are randomly selected: One group took the SAT
                without any prior studying; the second group took the SAT after studying on their
                own from a common study booklet available in the bookstore; and the third group took
                the SAT after completing a paid summer study session from a private test-prep
                company.</p>
            <p>The means and standard deviations of the resulting SAT scores from this hypothetical
                study are summarized below: <image style="block" src="../webcontent/assessment9q15image1.gif" /> Since we are comparing more than
                2 groups, we will use ANOVA to test whether the data provide evidence that SAT score
                is related to study strategy. </p>
            <p>One of the conditions that allows us to use ANOVA safely is that of equal
                (population) standard deviations. Can we assume that this condition is met in this
                case?</p>

                given, so we cannot check this condition.</choice>
