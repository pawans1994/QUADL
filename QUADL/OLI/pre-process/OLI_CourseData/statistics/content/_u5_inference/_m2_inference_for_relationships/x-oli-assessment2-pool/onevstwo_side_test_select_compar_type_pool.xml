            <p>Grain is fortified with vitamins at the factory when processed. But, before the
                product reaches the consumer, some of the vitamins may degrade due to time, heat
                during storage, and other factors. Suppose the vitamin contents (in milligrams per pound) of five
                bags of grain are measured at the factory before shipping and then again at the
                retail store after shipping. The results are as shown: <image style="block" src="../webcontent/assessment9q14image1.gif" /> We wish to test whether there is
                a statistically significant decrease in vitamin content after shipping.</p>
            <p>Given the design of the study and the question of interest, which one of the
                following 4 computer outputs is relevant to use?</p>

                <feedback>Correct. Since each of the 5 bags was measured twice (before and then
                    after shipping), the appropriate inferential method for analyzing the data is
                    matched pairs. This output is correct, since it tests the correct alternative.
                    Since we would like to test whether the vitamin content decreases by the time
                    the product reaches the consumer (i.e., before &gt; after) the correct alternative
                    is that the mean of the differences is &gt; 0 (Î¼<sub>d</sub> &gt; 0).</feedback>

            <p>As first year residential students get familiar with campus life, some students spend
                less time speaking with the residential advisor. Suppose individual call time (in
