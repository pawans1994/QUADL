            <p>The predicted IQ is obtained by plugging in a cry count of 25 into the regression
              line. We therefore obtain: Predicted IQ = 90.8 + 1.54 * 25 = 129.3. <link

            <p>It should be noted, however, that due to the moderately weak linearity, this
              prediction is not very accurate in the sense that the actual IQ level can be either
              much lower or much higher than this predicted value (in the same way that many of the
              data points are well below or above the line). In fact, given how far the data points
              are from the line, the IQ could be roughly anywhere between 90 and 167 as <link
