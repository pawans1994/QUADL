        <p>Let's check the two conditions:</p>

          Since the 40 subjects were chosen at random, we can assume that the two samples are
          independent.</p>
        <p><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T154106-0500" content="2."?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T154107-0500"?>(ii)<?oxy_insert_end?>
          Since the sample sizes (22 and 18) are not large, for the two-sample t-test to be reliably
          used the two populations need to be (at
          least<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T154119-0500" content=")"?>

          to normal.</p>
        <p>In practice, we check by looking at our two samples using histograms and
          mak<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T154133-0500"?>ing<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T154133-0500" content="e"?>
          sure that we don't see any gross violation of the normality assumption. However, both
          histograms display clear violations

          reliably used.</p>
