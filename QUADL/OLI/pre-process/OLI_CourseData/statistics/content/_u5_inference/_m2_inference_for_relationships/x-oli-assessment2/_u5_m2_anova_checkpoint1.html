		<!--LO:LO: Identify and distinguish among cases where use of calculations specific to independent samples, matched pairs, and ANOVA are appropriate.-->

			<choice value="A">A researcher is interested in determining the most effective format
				for advertising. He randomly assigns 60 people to one of three groups: (1) television
				commercial, (2) radio commercial, or (3) magazine advertisement. Group members review
				the commercial and then report whether or not they would buy the product.</choice>
			<choice value="B">In order to determine the effectiveness of different diet plans, 90
				people are randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) low calorie diet, 2) low-fat
				diet, or 3) low-carb diet. At the end of 60 days, the number of pounds lost was

				<feedback>That&apos;s incorrect. While there is a categorical explanatory variable, with
					more than 2 categories, the response variable is categorical (Yes, would buy the
					product/No, would not buy the product). The ANOVA is an example of Case C&rarr;Q,
					where there is a categorical explanatory variable and quantitative response
					variable. The correct answer is B.</feedback>

				<feedback>That is Correct! There is a categorical explanatory variable (type of
					diet), with more than two categories, and a quantitative response variable
					(number of pounds lost).</feedback>

			<response match="C" score="0">
				<feedback>That&apos;s incorrect. While it would be appropriate to use the ANOVA for B, it
					would not be appropriate to use the ANOVA for A. While A does have a categorical
					explanatory variable, with more than 2 categories, the response variable is
					categorical (Yes, would buy the product/No, would not buy the product). The
					ANOVA is an example of Case C?Q, where there is a categorical explanatory
					variable, with more than two categories, and quantitative response variable. The
					correct answer is B.</feedback>
			</response>
			<response match="D" score="0">
				<feedback>That&apos;s incorrect. While it would not be appropriate to use the ANOVA for
					A, it would be appropropriate to use it for B. In B, there is a categorical

		<p>Please use the following information for Questions 2, 3, and 4.</p>
		<p>To determine whether there is a relationship between the type of school attended
			and verbal reasoning scores for Irish students, three samples with 25 students, in
			each group, were randomly selected from data used by Raferty and Hout (1985). One group
			of students attended secondary school. The second group of students attended vocational
			school. And, the third group, consisted of students, who attended only primary
			school.</p>
