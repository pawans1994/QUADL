                        <p>In this part, we continue to handle situations involving one categorical
                            explanatory variable and one quantitative response variable, which is
                            case C→Q in our role/type classification table:</p>
                        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image093.gif" alt="It is possible
for any type of explanatory variable to be paired with any type of response variable.
The possible pairings are:
Categorical Explanatory → Categorical Response (C→C),
Categorical Explanatory → Quantitative Response (C→Q),
Quantitative Explanatory → Categorical Response (Q→C), and
Quantitative Explanatory → Quantitative Response (Q→Q)."/>
                        <p>So far we have discussed the two samples and matched pairs designs, in
                            which the categorical explanatory variable is two-valued. As we saw, in
                            these cases, examining the relationship between the explanatory and the
                            response variables amounts to comparing the mean of the response
                            variable (Y) in two populations, which are defined by the two values of
                            the explanatory variable (X). The difference between the two samples and
                            matched pairs designs is that in the former, the two samples are
                            independent, and in the latter, the samples are dependent.</p>
                        <p>We are now moving on to cases in which the categorical explanatory
                            variable takes more than two values. Here, as in the two-valued case,
                            making inferences about the relationship between the explanatory (X) and
                            the response (Y) variables amounts to comparing the means of the
                            response variable in the populations defined by the values of the
                            explanatory variable, where the number of means we are comparing
                            depends, of course, on the number of values of X. Unlike the two-valued
                            case, where we looked at two sub-cases (1) when the samples are
                            independent (two samples design) and (2) when the samples are dependent
                            (matched pairs design, here, we are just going to discuss the case where
                            the samples are independent. In other words, we are just going to extend
                            the two samples design to more than two independent samples.</p>

                        <p>The extension of the matched pairs design to more than two dependent
                            samples is called "Repeated Measures" and is beyond the scope of this
                            course. </p><p>The inferential method for comparing more than two means that we will introduce in this part is
                            called Analysis Of Variance (abbreviated as ANOVA), and the test
                            associated with this method is called the ANOVA F-test. The structure of
                            this part will be very similar to that of the previous two. We will
                            first present our leading example, and then introduce the ANOVA F-test
                            by going through its 4 steps, illustrating each one using the example.
                            (It will become clear as we explain the idea behind the test where the
                            name "Analysis of Variance" comes from.) We will then present another
                            complete example, and conclude with some comments about possible
                            follow-ups to the test. As usual, you'll have activities along the way
                            to check your understanding, and learn how to use software to carry out
                            the test.</p>
                        <p>Let's start by introducing our leading example.</p>

                            <p>Is "academic frustration" related to major?</p>
                            <p>A college dean believes that students with different majors may
                                experience different levels of academic frustration. Random samples
                                of size 35 of Business, English, Mathematics, and Psychology
                                major<?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095313-0500" comment="addition OK? (This point was unclear, and important to the conclusion, so I added this here and in the conclusion)"?>s

                                frustration on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 20 (highest).</p>
                            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image095.gif" alt="The X variable is major,
and it has four categories, which are Business, English, Mathematics, and Psychology. We have four populations,

samples."/>
                            <p>The figure highlights what we have already mentioned: examining the
                                relationship between major (X) and frustration level (Y) amounts to
