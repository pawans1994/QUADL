                <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that expected counts are calculated under
                    the assumption that the two categorical variables are not

                <feedback>Incorrect. While this answer is correct (since indeed,
                    expected counts are calculated under the assumption that the two categorical

                <feedback>Incorrect. While this answer is correct (since indeed,
                    expected counts are calculated assuming that the null hypothesis is true), this
                    is not the only correct answer. What does the null hypothesis claim? Try

                <feedback>Incorrect. On the

                    expected counts are calculated assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Also,
                    this answer implies that expected counts are calculated only after the
                    chi-square test has been carried out. This is not the
                    case<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T140230-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    since expected counts are needed in order to carry out the
                    test.<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T140235-0500"?>

                    Indeed, expected counts are calculated assuming that the two categorical
                    variables (in this case gender and piercing) are independent (or not related),
                    which is exactly what is claimed by the null hypothesis.</feedback>
