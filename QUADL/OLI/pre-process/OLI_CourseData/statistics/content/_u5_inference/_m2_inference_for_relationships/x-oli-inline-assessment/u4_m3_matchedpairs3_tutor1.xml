    <body>In order to test the effectiveness of a new drug in reducing cholesterol level, a random
      sample of 45 patients who have a higher than normal cholesterol level was chosen. The
      cholesterol level of each of the patients was measured and recorded before and then after
      taking the new drug for a period of 6 weeks, and the differences (before − after) were
      calculated. The appropriate set of hypotheses, in this case, is:</body>

      <choice value="A">(H<sub>0</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub> = 0) and (H<sub>a</sub>:

      <choice value="B">(H<sub>0</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub> = 0) and (H<sub>a</sub>:

      <response match="A">
        <feedback>Incorrect. Note that if the drug is effective, we would expect the participants'
          cholesterol levels to be lower after taking it for 6 weeks. This means that we expect the
          differences (level before − level after) to be.... </feedback>

      <response match="B" score="10">
        <feedback>Correct. If the drug is effective, we would expect the participants'
          cholesterol levels to be lower after taking it for 6 weeks. This means that we expect the
          differences (level before − level after) to be positive, and therefore the appropriate
          hypotheses in this case are (H<sub>0</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub> = 0) and (H<sub>a</sub>:
            &#956;<sub>d</sub> &gt; 0).</feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="C">
        <feedback>Incorrect. As the problem states, we are interested in testing the effectiveness
          of the drug. If the drug is effective, we would expect the participants' cholesterol
          levels to be lower after taking it for 6 weeks. This means that we expect the differences
          (level before − level after) to be.... </feedback>

      <response match="D">
        <feedback>Incorrect. This is a matched pairs situation. Each of the 45
          patients was measured twice; before and then after taking the drug.</feedback>
