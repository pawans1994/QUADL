        <p>Let's look at another example.</p>
        <example>
            <title>Steroid Use in Sports</title>

            <p>Major-league baseball star Barry Bonds admitted to using a steroid cream during the
                2003 season. Is steroid use different in baseball than in other sports? According to
                the 2001 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) survey
                (http://<?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T163739-0500" comment="I got a page not found error when I pasted this into google"?>www.ncaa.org/library/research/substance_use_habits/2001/substance_use_habits.pdf<?oxy_comment_end?>),
                which is self-reported and asked of a stratified random selection of teams from each
                of the three NCAA divisions, reported steroid use among the top 5 college sports was
                as follows:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image188.gif"
                alt="A two-way table which has

&quot;Total.&quot; The row labels are: &quot;Men's Baseball,&quot; &quot;Men's Basketball,&quot;
&quot;Men's Football,&quot; &quot;Men's Tennis,&quot; &quot;Men's track/field,&quot; and
&quot;Total.&quot; Here is the data in cell format (Row, Column: Value):
        Baseball, Reported Using: 26;
        Baseball, Reported Not Using: 1088;
        Baseball, Total: 1114;

        Total, Total: 4782;"/>
            <p>Do the data provide evidence of a significant relationship between steroid use and
                the type of sport? In other words, are there significant differences in steroid use
                among the different sports?</p>
            <p>Before we carry out the chi-square test for independence, let's get a sense of the
                data by calculating the conditional percents:</p>

            <p>It seems as if there are differences in steroid use among the different sports. Even
                though the differences do not seem to be overwhelming, since the sample size is so
                large, these differences might be significant. Let's carry out the test and see.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 1: Stating the hypotheses</em>
            </p>
            <p>The hypotheses are:</p>
            <p>
                <em>H<sub>o</sub>:</em> steroid use is not related to the type of sport (or: type of
                sport and steroid use are independent)</p>
            <p>
                <em>H<sub>a</sub>:</em> Steroid use is related to the type of sport (or: type of
                sport and steroid use are not independent).</p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 2: Checking conditions and finding the test statistic</em>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the Minitab output of the chi-square test for this example:</p>

                <li><p>Test statistic:</p>
                    <p>The test statistic is 14.626. Note that the "largest contributors" to the
                        test statistic are 5.729 and 3.990. The first cell corresponds to football
                        players who used steroids, with an observed count larger than we would
                        expect to see under independence. The second cell corresponds to tennis
                        players who used steroids, and has an observed count lower than we would
                        expect under independence.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <em>Step 3: Finding the p-value</em>
            </p>
            <p>According to the output p-value it would be extremely unlikely (probability of 0.006)
                to get counts like those observed if the null hypothesis were true. In other words,
                it would be very surprising to get data like those observed if steroid use were not
                related to sport type.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Step 4: Conclusion</em>
            </p>
            <p>The small p-value indicates that the data provide strong evidence against the null
                hypothesis, so we reject it and conclude that the steroid use is related to the type
                of sport.</p>
