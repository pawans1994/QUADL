                    <title>Overview</title>
                    <body><p>We are still in Case C→Q of inference about relationships, where the explanatory
                    variable is categorical and the response variable is quantitative. As we
                    mentioned in the introduction, we introduce three inferential
                    procedures in this case.</p>
                <p>So far we have introduced the first procedure&#8212;the two-sample t-test that is
                    used when we are comparing two means and the samples are independent. We now
                    move on to the second procedure, where we also compare two means, but
                    the samples are paired or matched. Every observation in one sample is
                    linked with an observation in the other sample. In this case, the samples are
                    <em>dependent</em>.</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image051.gif" alt="The X variable is a
two-valued categorical explanatory variable. Using the categories we split the population into
Population 1 and population 2. Each has its own Y mean, &mu;_1 and &mu;_2. For each population
we generate a matched pair SRS of size n."/>

                <p>One of the most common cases where dependent samples occur is when both samples
                    have the same subjects and they are "<em>paired by subject</em>." In other words, each
                    subject is measured twice on the response variable, typically before and then
                    after some kind of treatment/intervention in order to assess its effectiveness.</p></body></section>
                    
                    <example><title>SAT Prep Class</title>
                   <p>Suppose you want to assess the effectiveness of an SAT prep class. It
                    would make sense to use the matched pairs design and record each sampled
                    student's SAT score before and after the SAT prep classes are attended:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image052.gif" alt="The X variable is whether a student
has gone to prep class (Yes/No). From this we split the population into two populations: Population 1
which has Students with no SAT prep class, and Population 2, which has students that take the SAT prep
class. Each population has its own SAT Score (Y) Mean, which is &mu;_1 for population 1 and &mu;_2 for
population 2. We use the same subjects in both samples, but when we generate the SRS for population 1,
we do it before the students take the prep class, and after they take the prep class we generate the SRS
for population 2."/>
                        <p>Recall that the two populations represent the two values of the explanatory variable.  In this 
                        situation, those two values come from <em>a single set of subjects</em>.  In other words, both populations 
                        really have the <em style="italic">same students</em>. However, each population has a different value of the explanatory variable. 
                       Those values are:  no prep class,  prep class.                         </p>
                    </example>
                <p>This, however, is not the only case where the paired design is used. Other cases
                    are when the pairs are "natural pairs," such as siblings, twins, or couples. We
                    will present two examples in this part. The first one will be of the type where
                    each subject is measured twice, and the second one will be a study involving
                    twins.</p>
                <p>This section on matched pairs design will be organized very much like the
                    previous section on two independent samples. We will first introduce our leading
                    example, and then present the paired t-test illustrating each step using our
                    example. We will then look at another example, and finally talk about estimation
                    using a confidence interval. As usual, you'll be able to check your
                    understanding along the way, and will learn how to use software to carry out
                    this test.</p>
                <example><title>Drunk Drivers</title>
                    <p>Drunk driving is one the main causes of car accidents. Interviews with drunk
                        drivers who were involved in accidents and survived revealed that one of the
                        main problems is that drivers do not realize that they are impaired,
                        thinking "I only had 1-2 drinks ... I am OK to drive." A sample of 20
                        drivers was chosen, and their reaction times in an obstacle course were
                        measured before and after drinking two beers. The purpose of this study was
                        to check whether drivers are impaired after drinking two beers. Here is a
                        figure summarizing this study:</p>
                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image053.gif" alt="The X variable is whether
the driver had 2 beers or no beers. We have two populations, population 1 of sober drivers and population 2
of drivers who had two beers. For each population we have the Reaction Time (Y) mean, &mu;_1 for population 1
and &mu;_2 for population 2. We use the same drivers to generate the samples for both populations. The SRS
of size 20 is created for population 1 before the drivers have had 2 beers, and using the same drivers,
we generate the SRS of size 20 for population 2 after giving them 2 beers."/>

                <ol>
               <li> <p>Note that the categorical explanatory variable here is "drinking 2 beers
                    (Yes/No)", and the quantitative response variable is the reaction time.</p></li>
               <li> <p>Note that by using the matched pairs design in this study (i.e., by measuring
                    each driver twice), the researchers isolated the effect of the two beers on the
                    drivers and eliminated any other confounding factors that might influence the
                    reaction times (such as the driver's experience, age, etc.).</p></li>
               <li><p>For each driver, the two measurements are the total reaction time before
                    drinking two beers, and after. You can see the data by following these
                    instructions:</p></li></ol>
