  <question id="q1">
    <body>A publishing company wanted to test whether typing speed differs when using word processor A
      or word processor B. The typing speeds (in words per minute) are recorded for a random sample
      of 25 typists using word processor A, and for another (different) random sample of 25 typists
      using word processor B. The appropriate set of hypotheses in this case is:</body>
  <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
<choice value="A">(H<sub>0</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub> = 0) and (H<sub>a</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub>
        &lt; 0) </choice>
<choice value="B">(H<sub>0</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub> = 0) and (H<sub>a</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub>
        &gt; 0) </choice>
<choice value="C">(H<sub>0</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub> = 0) and (H<sub>a</sub>: &#956;<sub>d</sub>
        &#8800; 0) </choice>
<choice value="D">None of the above. This is not a matched pairs situation.</choice></multiple_choice>

    <response match="A"><feedback>Incorrect. Read the problem carefully again, and pay special attention to how this study was designed.</feedback></response>
    <response match="B"><feedback>Incorrect. Read the problem carefully again, and pay special attention to how this study was designed.</feedback></response>
    <response match="C"><feedback>Incorrect. Read the problem carefully again, and pay special attention to how this study was designed.</feedback></response>
    <response match="D" score="10"><feedback>Correct. This is not a matched pairs situation. Since two (different) random
          samples of secretaries were chosen, these two samples are independent, and not
          matched.</feedback></response>
