            <em>Now consider Scenario 2 (compared to Scenario 1):</em>
         </p>
         <p>Within-group variation is relatively <input_ref input="A"/>, and therefore the F

         <p>will be relatively <input_ref input="B"/>, indicating that H<sub>o</sub> will probably
               <input_ref input="C"/>, and we'll conclude that the population means <input_ref
               input="D"/>.</p>

            <feedback>Incorrect. Look at the spread within each of the groups in Scenario 2 as
               opposed to Scenario 1. For example, in Sample 3 in Scenario 2 the data range from 1
               to 48, while in Scenario 1, the data in Sample 3 range only from roughly 23 to
               27.5.</feedback>
