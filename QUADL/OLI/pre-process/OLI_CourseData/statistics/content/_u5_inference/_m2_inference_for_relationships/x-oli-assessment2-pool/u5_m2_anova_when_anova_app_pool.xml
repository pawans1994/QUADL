                for advertising. He randomly assigns 60 people to one of three groups: (1)
                television commercial, (2) radio commercial, or (3) magazine advertisement. Group
                members review the commercial and then report whether or not they would buy the

                low-fat diet, or (3) low-carb diet. At the end of 60 days, the number of pounds lost
                was recorded for each of the participants.</choice>

                blood sugar levels have been controlled over the last several months. The researcher
