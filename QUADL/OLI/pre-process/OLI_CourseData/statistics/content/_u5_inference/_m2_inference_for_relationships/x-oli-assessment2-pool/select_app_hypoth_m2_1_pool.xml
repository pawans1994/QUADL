            <p>A Canadian study measuring depression level in teens (as reported in the <em style="italic">Journal of Adolescence</em>, vol. 25, 2002) randomly sampled 112
                male teens and 101 female teens, and scored them on a common depression scale
                (higher score representing more depression). The researchers suspected that the mean
                depression score for male teens is higher than for female teens, and wanted to check
                whether data would support this hypothesis.</p>
            <p>If μ<sub>1</sub> and μ<sub>2</sub> represent the mean depression score
                for male teens and female teens respectively, which of the following is an
                appropriate pair of hypotheses in this case? Check all that apply.</p>

            <p>To determine the relative effectiveness of different study strategies for the SAT,
                suppose three groups of students are randomly selected: one group took the SAT
                without any prior studying; the second group took the SAT after studying on their
                own from a common study booklet available in the bookstore; and the third group took
                the SAT after completing a paid summer study session from a private test-prep
                company.</p>
            <p>The means and standard deviations of the resulting SAT scores from this hypothetical
                study are summarized below: <image style="block" src="../webcontent/assessment9q15image1.gif" /> Since we are comparing more than
                2 groups, we will use ANOVA to test whether the data provide evidence that SAT score
                is related to study strategy. </p>
            <p>Let μ<sub>1</sub>, μ<sub>2</sub>, and μ<sub>3</sub> be the mean SAT
                scores for students who use learning strategies 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the
                appropriate hypotheses in this case are:</p>
