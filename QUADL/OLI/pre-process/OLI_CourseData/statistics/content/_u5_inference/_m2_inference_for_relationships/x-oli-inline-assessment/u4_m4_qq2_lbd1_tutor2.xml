            <p>From the scatterplot we see that there is a general trend of a positive relationship
              between cry count and IQ, and that this relationship seems to be linear but quite
              weak. In order to quantify the strength of the linear relationship, we supplement the
              scatterplot with r, which turns out to be roughly 0.4. The value of r tells us that
              the linear relationship between cry count and IQ is weak to moderate.</p>
