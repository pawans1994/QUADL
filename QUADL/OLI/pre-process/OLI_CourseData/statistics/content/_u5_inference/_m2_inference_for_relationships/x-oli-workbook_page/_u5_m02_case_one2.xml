        <p>Furthermore, within the sub-case of comparing two means (i.e., examining the relationship
            between X and Y, when X has only two categories) we will distinguish between two
            (sub-sub) cases. Here, the distinction is somewhat subtle, and has to do with how the
            samples from each of the two sub-populations we're comparing are chosen. In other words,
            what study design will be implemented. We have learned that many experiments, as well as
            observational studies, make a comparison between two groups (sub-populations) in order
            to see how responses differ for the two possible categorical values. In some cases, one
            group (sub-population 1) has one categorical value, and <em>another independent
                group</em> (sub-population 2) has the other value. Independent samples are then
            taken from each group for comparison.</p>

            alt="Sub-Population 1 has a Y Mean of &mu;_1,
and Sub-Population 2 has a Y Mean of &mu;_2. From Sub-population 1 we take an SRS of size n_1,
and from Sub-population 2 we take an SRS of size n_2. Both of these samples are independent."/>
        <p>In other cases, a matched pairs sample design may be used, where each observation in one
            sample is <em>matched/paired/linked</em> with an observation in the other sample. These
            are sometimes called "<em>dependent samples</em>."</p>

            alt="Sub-Population 1 has a Y Mean of &mu;_1,
and Sub-Population 2 has a Y Mean of &mu;_2. From Sub-population 1 we take an SRS of size n_1,
and from Sub-population 2 we take an SRS by using a paired method with respect to the SRS for Sub-population
1, generating a SRS of size n_2. The two samples are paired/matched."/>
        <p>Matching could be by person (if the same person is measured twice), or could actually be
            a pair of individuals who belong together in a relevant way (husband and wife,
            siblings). In this design, then, the same individual or a matched pair of individuals is
            used to make two measurements of the response&#8212;one for each of the two categorical
            values.</p>

                <p>Note that in the first figure, where the samples are independent, the sample
                    sizes of the two independent samples need not be the same (and thus we used
                        n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> to indicate the two sample sizes). On the
                    other hand, it is obvious from the design that in the matched pairs the sample
                    sizes of the two samples must be the same (and thus we used n for both).</p>

        <example>

            <p>The department of motor vehicles wants to check whether drivers are impaired after
                drinking two beers. Consider the following two designs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>The reaction times (measured in seconds) in an obstacle course are measured
                        for a group of 10 drivers who had no beer. Two beers are given to each of a
                        different group of 9 drivers, and their reaction times on the same obstacle
                        course are measured. (In practice, this was done by selecting a random
                        sample of 19 drivers and randomly assigning them to one of the two groups.
                        The random assignment guarantees, at least in theory, that the two groups
                        are independent).</p>
                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image016.gif"
                        alt="One circle has 10 drivers in it, and
they have been given no beer. In another circle, there are 9 drivers, who have been given two beers."
                    /></li>
                <li>
                    <p>The reaction times (measured in seconds) in an obstacle course are measured
                        for 8 randomly selected drivers <em>before and then after </em>the
                        consumption of two beers.</p>
                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image017.gif"
                        alt="The data is generated from the 8 drivers
before giving them beers, and after giving them two beers, so that the data comes from the same
drivers."
                    /></li>
            </ol>
            <p>In the first design, we have two independent samples, and the second design is a
                matched-pairs design, since each individual was measured twice, once before and once
                after. The two figures highlight the main difference between the two designs. As
                we'll see, when we have two independent samples, the comparison of the reaction
                times is a comparison <em>between two groups</em>. In matched pairs, the comparison
                between the reaction times is done <em>for each individual.</em>

                <p>Each of the following three questions is an example of a situation in Case C→Q
                    (categorical explanatory and a quantitative response), and therefore calls for
                    comparing means of several (sub) populations. Your task is to decide which of
                    the sub-cases of Case C→Q each of the examples represents. </p>
                <p><em>Comment:</em> You'll note that each of these examples is a variation on the
                    same story, yet differs in the sub-case it represents. This was done on purpose
                    to highlight the differences between the sub-cases.</p>
