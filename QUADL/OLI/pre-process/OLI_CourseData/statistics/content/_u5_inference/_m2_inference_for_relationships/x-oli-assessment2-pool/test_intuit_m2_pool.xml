            <p>The mortality rate from melanoma (skin cancer) during the 1950s was recorded for each
                of the 48 contiguous United States, plus Washington, D.C. (as reported by Fisher and
                Van Belle (1993) and found at <link href="http://www.stat.psu.edu/~lsimon/stat501wc/sp05/data/" target="new">http://www.stat.psu.edu/~lsimon/stat501wc/sp05/data/</link></p>
            <p>The following is the scatterplot of the data:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/assessment9q11image1.gif" />
            <p>The plot shows a negative linear relationship between the latitude of the state and
                melanoma mortality rate.</p>
            <p>Which of the following is an appropriate interpretation of the negative relationship
                shown in the scatterplot above?</p>
        </body>
        <input shuffle="true">
            <choice value="A">The more southern the state, the higher the melanoma death
                rate.</choice>
            <choice value="B">The more northern the state, the higher the melanoma death
                rate.</choice>
            <choice value="C">The more southern the state, the more people that died of
                melanoma.</choice>
        </input>
        <part>
            <response match="A" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. From the scatterplot we see that the lower the latitude the
                    higher the mortality per 10 million. In other words, the more southern the
                    state, the higher the death rate. Note that since the response variable is the
                    mortality per 10 million, it measures the death rate rather than the number of
                    deaths.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Notice that there is a negative linear relationship between
                    latitude and mortality per 10 million. In other words, as latitude increases,
                    mortality per 10 million decreases.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Notice that the variable mortality per 10 million is a rate,
                    not an absolute count, of deaths from melanoma.</feedback>

            <p>Rainfall and corn crop yield reported for the 38 years from 1890 through 1927 give us
                the scatterplot shown below with an r = 0.0426. Yield is the number of ears of corn
                measured in metric tons per hectare, rainfall is in inches.</p>
            <p><image style="block" src="../webcontent/crop_yield.png" /></p>
            <p>Based on corn crop yield from Ezekiel, M. and K. A. Fox. (1959). <em style="italic">Methods of
                Correlation and Regression Analysis</em>. Wiley: New York.</p>
            <p>The plot shows a positive linear relationship between the inches of rainfall and the
                size of the corn yield.</p>
            <p>Which of the following is an appropriate interpretation of the relationship in
                the data shown above?</p>

            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Crop yield is the quantity (number of ears of corn) per area of
