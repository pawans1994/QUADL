            <p>To determine the relative effectiveness of different study strategies for the SAT,
                suppose three groups of students are randomly selected: One group took the SAT
                without any prior studying; the second group took the SAT after studying on their
                own from a common study booklet available in the bookstore; and the third group took
                the SAT after completing a paid summer study session from a private test-prep
                company.</p>
            <p>The means and standard deviations of the resulting SAT scores from this hypothetical
                study are summarized below: <image style="block" src="../webcontent/assessment9q15image1.gif" /> Since we are comparing more than
                2 groups, we will use ANOVA to test whether the data provide evidence that SAT score
                is related to study strategy. </p>
            <p>The following hypotheses were tested:</p>
            <p>H<sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub> = μ<sub>2</sub> = μ<sub>3</sub></p>
            <p>H<sub>a</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub>, μ<sub>2</sub>, and μ<sub>3</sub> are
                not all equal</p>
            <p>The analysis was run on the data and the following output was obtained:</p>

                <feedback>Correct. “The data provide strong evidence that the four mean scores
                    (representing the four teaching strategies) are not all equal" is a valid
                    conclusion. Since the p-value is essentially 0, we have strong evidence to
                    reject H<sub>0</sub> and in favor of the alternative. The alternative hypothesis claims
                    that the four means (of the four teaching strategies) are not all equal. In
                    other words, we have strong evidence that performance is related to teaching
                    strategy. Although ANOVA can tell you whether or not all of the means are equal,
                    it cannot tell you how they are ordered (it cannot tell you which way of
                    teaching works best).</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. “The data do not provide sufficient evidence that scores are
                    related to learning teaching strategy" is not a valid conclusion. The p-value is
                    extremely small (approximately 0), therefore strong evidence exists to reject H<sub>0</sub>
                    and favor of the alternative. The alternative hypothesis claims that the four
                    means (of the four teaching strategies) are not all equal. In other words, we
