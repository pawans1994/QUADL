        <p>The "driving after having 2 beers" example is a case in which observations are paired by
            subject. In other words, both samples have the same subject, so that each subject is
            measured twice. Typically, as in our example, one of the measurements occurs before a
            treatment/intervention (2 beers in our case), and the other measurement after the
            treatment/intervention. Our next example is another typical type of study where the
            matched pairs design is used&#8212;it is a study involving twins.</p>
        <example>
            <p>Researchers have long been interested in the extent to which intelligence, as
                measured by IQ score, is affected by "nurture" as opposed to "nature": that is, are
                people's IQ scores mainly a result of their upbringing and environment, or are they
                mainly an inherited trait? A study was designed to measure the effect of home
                environment on intelligence, or more specifically, the study was designed to address
                the question: "Are there significant differences in IQ scores between people who
                were raised by their birth parents, and those who were raised by someone else?"</p>
            <p>In order to be able to answer this question, the researchers needed to get two groups
                of subjects (one from the population of people who were raised by their birth
                parents, and one from the population of people who were raised by someone else) who
                are as similar as possible in all other respects. In particular, since genetic
                differences may also affect intelligence, the researchers wanted to control for this
                confounding factor.</p>
            <p>We know from our discussion on study design (in the Producing Data unit of the
                course) that one way to (at least theoretically) control for all confounding factors
                is randomization&#8212;randomizing subjects to the different treatment groups. In
                this case, however, this is not possible. This is an observational study; you cannot
                randomize children to either be raised by their birth parents or to be raised by
                someone else. How else can we eliminate the genetics factor? We can conduct a "twin
                study."</p>
            <p>Because identical twins are genetically the same, a good design for obtaining
                information to answer this question would be to compare IQ scores for identical
                twins, one of whom is raised by birth parents and the other by someone else. Such a
                design (matched pairs) is an excellent way of making a comparison between
                individuals who only differ with respect to the explanatory variable of interest
                (upbringing) but are as alike as they can possibly be in all other important aspects
                (inborn intelligence). Identical twins raised apart were studied by Susan Farber,
                who published her studies in the book "Identical Twins Reared Apart" (1981, Basic
                Books). In this problem, we are going to use the data that appear in Farber's book
                in table E6, of the IQ scores of 32 pairs of identical twins who were reared
                apart.</p>
            <p>Here is a figure that will help you understand this study:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image083.gif" alt="The variable X takes on two
categories: Upbringing by birth parents or someone else. These two categories form population 1
and population 2. For each population, we have a IQ (Y) mean, &mu;_1 for population 1 and &mu;_2
for population 2. We generate the samples in matched pairs by using the relationship of twins separated
at birth. So, we generate an SRS of size 32 for population 1 and also one of size 32 for population 2
using this relationship, paired by twins."/>
            <p>Here are the important things to note in the figure:</p>
            <ol>
           <li> <p>We are essentially comparing the mean IQ scores in two populations that are
                defined by our (two-valued categorical) explanatory variable &#8212; upbringing (X),
                whose two values are: raised by birth parents, raised by someone else.</p></li>
          <li><p>This is a matched pairs design (as opposed to a two independent samples design),
                since each observation in one sample is linked (matched) with an observation in the
                second sample. The observations are paired by twins.</p></li></ol>

            <p>Each of the 32 rows represents one pair of twins. Keeping the notation that we used

            <ol>
         <li>   <p><em>Stating the hypotheses.</em></p>
            <p>Recall that in matched pairs, we reduce the data from two samples to one sample of

            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image084.gif" alt="A table with 4 rows describing

the pair and its difference."/>
            <p>and we state our hypotheses in terms of the mean of the differences, <m:math

            <p>Since we would like to test whether there are differences in IQ scores between people

            <p>Again, some students find it easier to first think about the hypotheses in terms of

                case, so just to be on the safe side, we should look at the histogram of the
                differences just to make sure that we do not see anything extreme. (Comment: Looking
                at the histogram of differences in every case is useful even if the sample is very

            <p>This means that if, based on prior knowledge, prior research, or just a hunch, we had
                wanted to test the hypothesis that the IQ level of people raised by their birth
                parents is lower, on average, than the IQ level of people who were raised by someone
                else, we would have rejected H<sub>o</sub> and accepted that hypothesis (at the .05
                significance level, since .037 &lt; .05).</p>
            <p>It should be stressed, though, that one should set the hypotheses before looking at
                the data. It would be ethically wrong to look at the histogram of differences, note
                that most of the differences are negative, and then decide to carry out the
                one-sided test that the data seem to support. This is known as "data snooping," and
                is considered to be a very bad statistical practice.</p></body></section>
