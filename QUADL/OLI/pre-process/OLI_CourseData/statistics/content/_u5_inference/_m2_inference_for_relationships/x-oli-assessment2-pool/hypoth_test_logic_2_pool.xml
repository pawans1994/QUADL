            <p>To determine if there is a relationship between grade performance and extracurricular
                participation, North Carolina State conducted a study of 112 students, recording the
                number of students in each of three extracurricular categories and each of two
                grade categories. Here are the results: <image style="block" src="../webcontent/assessment9q18image1.gif" /> Source:

                <feedback>Incorrect. You are correct that the sample is large enough (the expected
                    counts for Hispanic males is larger than 5) and the expected counts are the
                    counts that we would expect to see if the null hypothesis of the chi-square test
                    were true. However, calculating the expected count is not dependent on meeting
                    the conditions of the chi-square procedure. Additionally, the expected count
                    does not rely on the assumption that the categories related, but rather the
                    opposite.</feedback>
