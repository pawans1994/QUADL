        <body>
            <p>(i) Survey a random sample of 40 seniors and get them to report the number of credits
                they took in each of their four years, then compare the four sample mean numbers of
                credits.</p>
            <p>(ii) Survey random samples of 40 seniors, 40 juniors, 40 sophomores, and 40 freshmen,
                and get them to report the number of credits they are taking.</p>
            <p>Which of the above two designs should not be handled with ANOVA?</p>

        <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
            <choice value="A">design (i)</choice>
            <choice value="B">design (ii)</choice>

        <part>
            <response match="A" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. Indeed, this design should not be handled with ANOVA since the
                    samples are not independent (all four samples have the same 40
                    students).</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Note that in design (i), the samples are not independent (all
                    four samples have the same 40 students), and therefore ANOVA should not be used.
                    In design (ii), the samples are independent (since each of them was chosen
                    randomly) which is required in order to use ANOVA. </feedback>
