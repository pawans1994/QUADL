Recall that r measures the strength of the linear relationship in our data (where the closer r is to -1 or 1, the stronger the
 linear relationship). The p-value of the test measures the strength of the
 evidence provided by the data that what was observed can be generalized to the
 relevant population

 the smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence). </p></feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback><p id="aa8655ca060274bb8ad1ccb13ea01ddd9">Incorrect. It is true that the small p-value (0.012) indicates that the data provide fairly strong evidence that what we observed can

 Indeed, r = 0.4 indicates that there is a moderately weak linear relationship
 between cry count and IQ in our data. In addition, the small p-value (0.012)
 tells
 us that
 these
 data provide fairly strong evidence that this linear relationship can be
 generalized to infants in
 the
 population. </p></feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
