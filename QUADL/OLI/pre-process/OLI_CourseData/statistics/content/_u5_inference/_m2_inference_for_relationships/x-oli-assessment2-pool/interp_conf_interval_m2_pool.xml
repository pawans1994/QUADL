            <p>In a study of the impact of smoking on birth weight, researchers analyze birth
                weights (in grams) for babies born to 189 women who gave birth in 1989 at a hospital
                in Massachusetts. In the group, 74 of the women were categorized as "smokers" and
                115 as "nonsmokers." The difference in the two sample mean birth weights
                (nonsmokers minus smokers) is 281.7 grams and the 95% confidence interval is (76.5,
                486.9)</p>
            <p>Which gives the best interpretation of what we can conclude about the impact of
                smoking on birth weight?</p>

            <choice value="A">We are 95% confident that on average, smoking causes lower birth

            <choice value="B">There is a 95% chance that if a woman smokes during pregnancy her baby
                will weigh between 76.5 grams to 486.9 grams less than if she did not
                smoke.</choice>
            <choice value="C">When smokers are compared to nonsmokers, we are 95% confident that the
                mean weight of babies of nonsmokers is between 76.5 grams to 486.9 grams more than
                the mean weight of babies of smokers.</choice>

            <p>Breastfeeding burns up to 500 calories per day, so does that mean that women who
                breastfeed their infants will lose more weight than women who formula feed their
                infants? A group of researchers studied the amount of weight lost after giving birth
                by mothers who breastfed their infants and mothers who chose formula feeding. They
                randomly chose 29 breastfeeding mothers and 21 formula feeding mothers. The
                researchers recorded how much weight each group lost at 12 months after childbirth.
                The amount of weight lost was found to be normally distributed. The difference in
                the mean amount of weight lost for the two samples (breastfeeding vs. formula
                feeding) is 2.0 kg and the 95% confidence interval is (1.05, 4.19).</p>
