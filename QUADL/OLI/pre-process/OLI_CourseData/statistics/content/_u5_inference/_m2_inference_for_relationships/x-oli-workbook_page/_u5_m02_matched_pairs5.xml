<title>Step 3: Finding the p-value</title>
<body>

    <p>As a special case of the one-sample t-test, the null distribution of the paired t-test
                    statistic is a t distribution (with n - 1 degrees of freedom), which is the
                    distribution under which the p-values are calculated. We will let the software
                    find the p-value for us, and in this case, Excel gives us a p-value of
                    0.009.</p>

<p>The small p-value tells us that there is very little chance of getting data like those observed
                    (or even more extreme) if the null hypothesis were true. More specifically,
                    there is less than a 1% chance (.009=.9%) of obtaining a test statistic of -2.58
                    (or lower), assuming that 2 beers have no impact on reaction times.</p>

<title>Step 4: Conclusion in Context.</title>
<body>
<p>As usual, we draw our conclusion based on the p-value. If the p-value is small, there is a
                    significant difference between what was observed in the sample and what was
                    claimed in H<sub>o</sub>, so we reject H<sub>o</sub> and conclude that the
                    categorical explanatory variable does affect the quantitative response variable
                    as specified in H<sub>a</sub>. If the p-value is not small, we do not have
                    enough statistical evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>. In particular, if a cutoff
                    probability, α (significance level), is specified, we reject H<sub>o</sub> if
                    the p-value is less than α. Otherwise, we do not reject H<sub>o</sub>. </p>
<p>In our example, the p-value is .009, indicating that the data provide enough evidence to reject
                        H<sub>o</sub> and conclude that drinking two beers does slow the reaction
                    times of drivers, and thus that drivers are impaired after drinking two
                    beers.</p>

<title>Comment</title>
<body>

    <p>It is very important to pay attention to whether the two-sample t-test or the paired t-test
                    is appropriate. In other words, being aware of the study design is extremely
                    important. Consider our example. If we had not "caught" that this is a matched
                    pairs design, and had analyzed the data as if the two samples were independent
                    using the two-sample t-test, we would have obtained a p-value of 0.057.</p>

<p>Note that using this (wrong) method to analyze the data, and a significance level of .05, we would conclude that the data do not provide enough evidence for us to conclude that drivers are impaired after drinking two beers. This is an example of how using the wrong statistical method can lead you to wrong conclusions, which in this context can have very serious implications.</p>
