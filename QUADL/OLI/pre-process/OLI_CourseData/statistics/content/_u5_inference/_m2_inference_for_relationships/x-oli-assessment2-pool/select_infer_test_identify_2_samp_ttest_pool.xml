            <p>We suspect the overall mean monthly rent of apartments in Shadyside is higher than in
                Oakland, so we survey a random sample of <em style="italic">Oakland</em> apartments,
                and a random sample of <em style="italic">Shadyside</em> apartments.</p>
            <p>Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical test to use to determine
                if the overall mean monthly rent of apartments in Shadyside is higher than in
                Oakland?</p>

            <p>A psychologist wants to study whether there is a difference in the effectiveness of
                two different talk therapy techniques (exposure therapy or cognitive behavioral
                therapy) on phobia symptom severity. The psychologist randomly assigns a large group
                of clients suffering from a phobia into one of the two treatment conditions:
                exposure therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy. After 8 weeks of therapy, the
                psychologist assesses the phobia symptoms of both groups of clients using a
                questionnaire that gives a number between 0 to 40 to indicate the severity of the
