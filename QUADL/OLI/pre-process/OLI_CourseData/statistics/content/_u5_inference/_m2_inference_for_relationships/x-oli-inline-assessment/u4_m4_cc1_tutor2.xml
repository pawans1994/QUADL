      your findings. Recall that we calculate the percentages of the response

<p>The question now is whether this difference in the percentages is significant or not. In other
          words, the next step would be to carry out a significance test that will assess whether
          observing data like ours (where there is a difference of 8% between the firefighters who
          participated in the
