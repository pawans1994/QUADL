            <p>A management consultant was interested in whether workers who telecommute are as
                productive as those who work in the office. She randomly selected 60 workers who
                were in each of the following three groups: (1) full-time office workers, (2)
                part-time telecommuters, (3) full time telecommuters. After analyzing the data, the
                consultant noticed that the variation within groups was large relative to the the
                variation between sample means.</p>
            <p>Which of the following is the most correct interpretation of this data?</p>

            <p>A psychology program coordinator was interested in whether there was a difference in
                salary for the mental health counseling graduates of her masterâ€™s degree program
                based on whether they obtained employment in (1) a sole proprietor private practice,
                (2) a group private practice, (3) hospitals or (4) government agencies. After analyzing
                the data for 90 recent graduates, the consultant noticed that the variation within
                groups was small relative to the the variation between sample means.</p>
