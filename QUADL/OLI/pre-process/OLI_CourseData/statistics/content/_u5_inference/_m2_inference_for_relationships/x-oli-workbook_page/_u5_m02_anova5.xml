            <body>
                <p>As usual, we base our conclusion on the p-value. A small p-value tells us that
                    our data contain a lot of evidence against
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T094921-0500"?>H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T094915-0500" content="Ho"?>.
                    More specifically, a small p-value tells us that the differences between the
                    sample means are statistically significant (unlikely to have happened by
                    chance), and therefore we reject
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T094938-0500"?>H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T094936-0500" content="Ho"?>.
                    If the p-value is not small, the data do not provide enough evidence to reject
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T094952-0500"?>H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T094950-0500" content="Ho"?>,
                    and so we continue to believe that it may be true. A significance level (cut-off
                    probability) of .05 can help determine what is considered a small p-value.</p>
                <example>
                    <p>In our
                        example<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095004-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
