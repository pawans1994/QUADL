            <p>The mortality rate from melanoma (skin cancer) during the 1950s was recorded for each
                of the 48 contiguous United States, plus Washington, D.C. (as reported by Fisher and
                Van Belle (1993) and found at <link href="http://www.stat.psu.edu/~lsimon/stat501wc/sp05/data/" target="new">http://www.stat.psu.edu/~lsimon/stat501wc/sp05/data/</link></p>
            <p>The following is the scatterplot of the data:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/assessment9q11image1.gif" />
            <p>The plot shows a negative linear relationship between the latitude of the state and
                melanoma mortality rate.</p>
            <p>Based on the scatterplot and the value of the correlation coefficient, it would make
                sense to test the significance of this observed linear relationship between latitude
                and melanoma mortality rate.</p>
            <p>Which of the following are the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses?</p>
