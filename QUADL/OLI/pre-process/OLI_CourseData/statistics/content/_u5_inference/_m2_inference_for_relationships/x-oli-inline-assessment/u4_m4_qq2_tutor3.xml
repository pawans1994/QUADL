        <p>H<sub>0</sub>: There is not a linear relationship between the response time and the
            damage in a fire.</p>
        <p>H<sub>a</sub>: There is a linear relationship between the response time and the damage in
            a fire.</p>
        <p>Our conclusion is that there is not sufficient evidence of a significant linear
            relationship between response time and fire damage.</p>
        <p>For each of the p-value(s) below, indicate whether or not the value would support this
            conclusion:</p>
