		<title>How to Read Statistical Software Output</title>
	</head>
	<body>


		<p>Outputs from statistical programs vary by software programs. This information should help
			you to interpret the t-test results from the different programs. Please note that, while
			the information will vary in setup and format from program to program, the values are
			the same, since the same data is used for all the printouts. In addition, the format of
			output will be different for other tests (ex. correlation, regression, ANOVA); thus,
			this information pertains only to the output for t-tests.</p>
		<p>As reference, here is information on the problem data that was analyzed in the
			printouts:</p>

			<title>What is more important to you — personality or looks?</title>
			<body>

				<p>This question was asked of a random sample of 239 college students, who were to
					answer on a scale of 1 to 25. An answer of 1 means personality has maximum
					importance and looks no importance at all, whereas an answer of 25 means looks
					have maximum importance and personality no importance at all. The purpose of
					this survey was to examine whether males and females differ with respect to the
					importance of looks vs. personality.</p>

			</body>
		</section>
		<p><em style="bold">R Output:</em></p>
		<p>R was used to calculate the two independent samples t-test result, using gender (Gender)
			as the categorical explanatory/independent variable and the importance of personality
			(looks) as the quantitative response/dependent variable. The data command used to
			produce this output is as follows:</p>
		<image src="../../webcontent/stat_printouts/image1.png" alt="t.test(looks$Score~looks$Gender)
	(top line) Welch Two Sample t-test
	(second line) looks$Score by looks$Gender
	(third line) t = -4.6574, df = 182.973, p-value = 6.143e-06
	(fourth line) alternative hypothesis: true differenc ein means is not equal to 0
	(fifth line) 95 percent confidence interval:
	(sixth line) -3.695865 -1.496292
	(seventh line) sample estimates:
	(eighth line) mean in group Female,  mean in group Male
	(ninth line) 10.73333  13.32941
	"/>

		<p>The top line tells us that a two sample t-test was calculated.</p>
		<p>The second line tell us specifically what was analyzed (ex. data:)</p>
		<p>The third line has three values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>t = -4.6574, which is the value of the t-statistic</li>
			<li>df = 182.973, which is the degrees of freedom. It is used when determining critical
				value.</li>
			<li>p-value = 6.143e-06, which is the exact probability of getting this value for the
				t-statistic. The value is written in scientific notation, which needs to be
				converted to get the exact probability level. Since this value ends in e-06, the
				decimal point needs to be moved 6 places to the left. Thus, 6.143e-06 equals
				.000006143, which is very, very small. When rounded to four decimal points, the
				P-value is .0001; thus, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no
				difference between the mean score of Females and the mean score of Males on the
				importance of looks.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The fourth line describes the alternative hypothesis. In this case, since the “true
			difference in means is not equal to 0;” thus, it assessing that the claim that there is
			a difference, but not that one group is higher or lower than the other group, which is a
			two-sided, two independent samples t-test.</p>
		<p>The fifth line tells us that the sixth line contains the 95% confidence interval that can
			be used to assess the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub> : μ<sub>1</sub> - μ<sub>2</sub> =
			0). Thus, the 95% confidence interval is: (-3.695865, -1.496292). Since 0 does not fall
			within the 95% confidence interval, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no
			difference between the mean score of Females and the mean score of Males on the
			importance of looks. As it should be, these results are consistent with the above
			results, where the P-value was used.</p>
		<p>The last three lines give us information on the samples; in this case, group means.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>mean personality score for females: 10.73333</li>
			<li>mean personality score for males: 13.32941</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em style="bold">StatCrunch (edited) Output:</em></p>
		<p>StatCrunch was used to produce the following three charts, with gender (Gender) as the
			categorical explanatory/independent variable and the importance of personality (looks)
			as the quantitative response/dependent variable.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The first chart contains summary statistics for the two samples (Females and Males)
				on the quantitative response/dependent variable (looks).</li>
			<li>The second chart contains the (two-sided) two independent samples t-test result,
				using gender (Gender) as the categorical explanatory/independent variable and the
				importance of personality (looks) as the quantitative response/dependent variable
				with the P-value method for assessing the null hypothesis.</li>
			<li>The third chart contains the (two-sided) two independent samples t-test result,
				using gender (Gender) as the categorical explanatory/independent variable and the
				importance of personality (looks) as the quantitative response/dependent variable
				with the 95% confidence interval method for assessing the null hypothesis.</li>

		<p>The top line tells us that a two sample t-test was calculated, using score as the
			response/dependent variable and gender as the explanatory/independent variable.</p>
		<p>The second line tell us that the two sample t-test was calculated with score as the
			response/dependent variable.</p>
		<p>The third, fourth, and fifth lines, comprise a table of summary statistics for the
			response/dependent variable. The third line gives a description of the information
			contained in each column, while the first column tells us what information is contained
			in each of the rows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Column 1 contains information on the x (explanatory/independent) categorical
				variable. In this case, there are two levels of the x variable, Gender: males and
				females. Thus, row 2 refers only to information on the sample of Females, while row
				3 refers only to information on the sample of Males.</li>
			<li>Column 2 contains information on the number of observations in each sample: 150
				Females and 85 Males.</li>
			<li>Column 3 contains the means for each of the samples: 10.73 for Females and 13.33 for
				Males.</li>
			<li>Column 4 contains the standard deviation for each of the samples: 4.25 for Females
				and 4.02 for Males.</li>
			<li>Column 5 contains the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (which is also
				known as the standard error): 0.35 for Females and 0.44 for Males.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The sixth line contains information on the difference that is being assessed: μu - μu; in
			this case, the population mean of males is subtracted from the population mean of
			females.</p>
		<p>The seventh line the difference between the sample means that is being assessed in the
			t-test. Thus, the mean from the sample of Females (10.73) minus the mean from the sample

		<p>The eighth line contains the 95% confidence interval that can be used to assess the null
			hypothesis (H0 : μ1 - μ2 = 0). Thus, the 95% confidence interval is: (-3.696, -1.496).
			Since 0 does not fall within the 95% confidence interval, we can reject the null
			hypothesis that there is no difference between the mean score of Females and the mean
			score of Males on the importance of looks.</p>
		<p>The ninth line has three values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>T-Test of difference = 0 (vs not =): T-Value = -4.66, which tells us that this is a
				two-sided two sample t-test, with a t-statistic value of -4.66.</li>
			<li>P-value = 0.000, which is the exact probability of getting this value for the
				t-statistic. Since it is not possible to have 0 probability, the last value is
				changed to a 1, when reporting, and it shows that, with a P-value of .001, we can
				reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the mean score of
				Females and the mean score of Males on the importance of looks. As it should be,
				these results are consistent with the results from the previous line (line 8), where
				the 95% confidence interval was used.</li>
