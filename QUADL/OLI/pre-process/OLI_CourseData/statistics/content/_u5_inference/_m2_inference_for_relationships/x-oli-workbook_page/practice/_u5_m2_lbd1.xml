    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to give you guided practice in checking whether the
            conditions that allow us to use the two-sample t-test are met.</p>

            <title>Background</title>
            <body>
                <p>A researcher wanted to study whether or not men and women differ in the amount of
                    time they watch TV during a week. In each of the following cases, you'll have to
                    decide whether we can use the two-sample t-test to test this claim or not.</p>
            </body>
        </section>
        <p>1. A random sample of 40 adults was chosen (22 of whom were women and 18 of whom were
            men). At the end of the week, each of the 40 subjects reported the total amount of time
            (in minutes) that he/she watched TV during that week. </p>

                    <p>Reminder: To construct histograms of the data:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First we need to define the bins that Excel will use to create the
                            histogram. In this case, our minimum data point is 120, and our max is
                            2700. We'll use a bin width of 250, and make bins from 100 to 2849:</li>
                        <li>In an empty cell type Bin and in the cell to the right type
                            Frequency.</li>
                        <li>In the cell under Bin put the different bins based on the bin width of
                            250. Here the first bin would be 100-349. Continue adding bins by typing
                            350-599, 600-849, 850-1099, etc. When finished you should have 11
                            bins.</li>
                        <li>Next sort the data by first highlighting a column and then selecting
                                <em>sort smallest to largest</em> from the pop-up menu that appears
                            by pressing the <em>Sort and Filter button</em> from the
                                <em>Editing</em> group on the <em>Home</em> tab. Make sure to select
                                <em>Continue with the current selection</em> so Excel does not
                            adjust the other columns.</li>
                        <li>With the data sorted, you can count the number that would fit into each
                            bin and put those counts in the column under Frequency.</li>
                        <li>Now highlight the Bin and Frequency columns. Then navigate to the
                                <em>Insert</em> tab, find the <em>Chart</em> group and click on the
                                <em>insert column</em> button (the picture of an upright bar graph).
                            From there select <em>clustered column</em> under <em>2-D
                            column.</em></li>
                        <li>Histograms shouldn't have spaces between the bars, so right-click on one
                            of the bars and choose <code style="inline">Format Data Series</code>.
                            Then set the gap width to 0% (no gap).</li>

                    <p>Proceed just as before to make a histogram. However, you may want to change
                        the bin length. In this case, our minimum data point is 220, and our max is
                        700. We'll use a bin width of 50, and make bins from 200 to 749 for a total
                        of 11 bins.</p>
