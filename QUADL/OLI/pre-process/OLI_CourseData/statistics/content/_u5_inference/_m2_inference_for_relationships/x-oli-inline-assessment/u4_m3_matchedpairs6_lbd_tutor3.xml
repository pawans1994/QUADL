        <body>Based on the visual display that you produced for answering the previous question,
            does it seem like there is some evidence in the data in favor of the alternative
            hypothesis? Explain.</body>

            <explanation>We notice that most of the differences (7 out of 11) are negative,
                indicating that in 7 of the 11 plots, the dry seeds produced more corn yield. This
                is evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, but the evidence is not
                overwhelming, so it is hard to say whether this is strong enough evidence to reject
