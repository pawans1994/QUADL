                        <p>A Canadian study measuring depression level in teens (as reported in the
                                    <em style="italic">Journal of Adolescence</em>, vol. 25, 2002)
                              randomly sampled 112 male teens and 101 female teens, and scored them
                              on a common depression scale (higher score representing more
                              depression). The researchers suspected that the mean depression score
                              for male teens is higher than for female teens, and wanted to check
                              whether data would support this hypothesis.</p>

                              the SAT, suppose three groups of students are randomly selected: One
                              group took the SAT without any prior studying; the second group took
                              the SAT after studying on their own from a common study booklet
                              available in the bookstore; and the third group took the SAT after
                              completing a paid summer study session from a private test-prep
                              company. The means and standard deviations of the resulting SAT scores

                  raise students GRE Verbal Reasoning scores. In order to assess the accuracy of this
                  claim, a researcher randomly selected a sample of 30 graduating seniors from a local
                  university, who are applying to business school. The 30 students first took the GRE,
                  without any preparation. The 30 students then took the GRE again, after completing
                  the GRE prep course. The researcher then compared the performance for each student
                  to determine whether there was improvement on the GRE Verbal Reasoning scores from
                  the first to second administrations.</p><p>What hypothesis testing

                              more than two groups) and here we are comparing only two. Also, in ANOVA the
                              samples are independent which is not the case here. Since the same group of
                              students was measured twice (before and then after the GRE prep course) the
                              samples are not independent. Therefore the appropriate statistical technique
