                        <p>Using StatCrunch, we calculate a p-value of 0.0004, a value that is so small 
                            that it is essentially  0.  This means that it would be (almost) impossible 
                            to obtain data like those observed (or more extreme) just by chance (i.e., if 
                            risk of alcohol problems and participation in the 9/11 rescue were not related). 
                            This provides very strong evidence against H0 , and we can conclude that the risk 
                            of alcohol problems among New York firefighters and first responders is
                            related to participation in the 9/11 rescue.</p>
