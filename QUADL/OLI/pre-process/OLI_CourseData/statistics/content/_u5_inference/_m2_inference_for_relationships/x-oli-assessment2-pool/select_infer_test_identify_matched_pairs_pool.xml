                mate) before they receive special training on a variety of chess moves, including
                Sea Cadet’s mate. Time 2 is the time (in seconds) that the same player takes to make
                their next move when presented with the configuration for Sea Cadet’s mate after
                being trained to recognize and respond to that configuration. The researcher would
                like to test the effectiveness of the training by comparing the time needed to make
                a move before and after the specialized training session to see if there was a
                decrease in the time that the beginner chess players took to make the move.</p>
            <p>If we would like to test the effectiveness of the training, which of the following is
                the appropriate inference method to analyze these data?</p>
