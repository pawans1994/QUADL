                or whether it is possible to calculate and do the analysis using the differences
                "response 2 - response
                1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T182345-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?>"<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T182346-0500" content="."?>
            </question>
<answer> Both ways of calculating the differences are fine (as long, of course, as all the
                differences are calculated the same way). You should pay careful attention to how
                the differences are
                calculated<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T182356-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                since that will determine the direction of the alternative hypothesis (in the
                one-sided case). In our example, the differences in reaction times were calculated:
                before 2 beers - after 2 beers, and therefore in order to test whether drivers are
                impaired after two beers (i.e., whether their reaction times
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T182414-0500"?>are
                <?oxy_insert_end?>longer after drinking two beers) the appropriate hypotheses are:
                    <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/image420.gif" alt="H_0: &mu;_d = 0 vs.
H_a: &mu;_d &lt; 0"/> However, if the
                differences were calculated: after 2 beers - before 2 beers, the appropriate
                alternative
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T182441-0500"?>hypothesis
                <?oxy_insert_end?>would also change direction, and we would test: <image
                    style="block" src="../../webcontent/image421.gif" alt="H_0: &mu;_d = 0 vs.
H_a: &mu;_d &gt; 0"/>
            </answer>
