        <p>Before we give you hands-on practice in carrying out the ANOVA F-test, let's look at
            another example:</p>
        <example>

            <p>Do advertisers alter the reading level of their ads based on the target audience of
                the magazine they advertise in?</p>
            <p>In 1981, a study of magazine advertisements was conducted (F.K. Shuptrine and D.D.
                McVicker, "Readability Levels of Magazine Ads," Journal of Advertising Research,
                21:5, October 1981). Researchers selected random samples of advertisements from each
                of three groups of magazines:</p>
            <p>Group
                1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095550-0500"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095548-0500" content=" - "?>highest
                educational level magazines (such as Scientific American, Fortune, The New
                Yorker)</p>
            <p>Group
                2<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095558-0500"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095556-0500" content=" - "?>middle
                educational level magazines (such as Sports Illustrated, Newsweek, People)</p>
            <p>Group
                3<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095607-0500"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095605-0500" content=" - "?>lowest
                educational level magazines (such as National Enquirer, Grit, True Confessions)</p>
            <p>The measure that the researchers used to assess the level of the ads was the number
                of words in the ad. 18 ads were randomly selected from each of the magazine groups,
                and the number of words per ad were recorded.</p>
            <p>The following figure summarizes this problem:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/anova/image19.png" alt="The variable Education Level
(X) has three categories: High, Medium, and Low. From these categories, we form our populations: High
education level magazines, medium education level magazines, and low education level magazines.
Each population has its own # of words in ads (Y) mean. From each population we create a sample of size
18. We find that for High level magazines, Y-bar_1 = 140.0 . For medium level, Y-bar_2 = 121.4, and for
low level, Y-bar_3 = 106.5"/>
            <p>Our question of interest is whether the number of words in ads (Y) is related to the
                educational level of the magazine (X). To answer this
                question<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095648-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                we need to compare <m:math overflow="scroll">

                </m:math>, the mean number of words in ads of the three magazine groups. Note in the
                figure that the sample means

                provided. It seems that what the data suggest makes sense; the magazines in group 1
                have the largest number of words per ad (on average) followed by group 2, and then
                group 3. </p>
            <p>The question is whether these differences between the sample means are significant.
                In other words, are the differences among the observed sample means due to true
                differences among the μ's or merely due to sampling
                variability<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095800-0500"?>?<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095758-0500" content="."?>
                To answer this question, we need to carry out the ANOVA F-test. </p>
            <p>Step 1: Stating the
                hypotheses<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095843-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?></p>
            <p>We are testing:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image120.gif" alt="H_0: &mu;_1 = &mu;_2 = &mu;_3.
  H_a: not all &mu;'s are equal"/>
            <p>Conceptually, the null hypothesis claims that the number of words in ads is not
                related to the educational level of the magazine, and the
                alternative<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095823-0500"?>
                hypothesis<?oxy_insert_end?> claims that there is a relationship.</p>
            <p>Step 2: Checking conditions and summarizing the
                data<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095846-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?></p>
            <p>(i) The ads were selected at random from each magazine group, so the three samples
                are independent.</p>
            <p>In order to check the next two conditions, we'll need to look at the data (condition
                ii), and calculate the sample standard deviations of the three samples (condition
                iii). Here are the
                side<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095911-0500"?>-<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095912-0500" content=" "?>by<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095913-0500"?>-<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T095914-0500" content=" "?>side
                boxplots of the data, followed by the standard deviations:</p>

&quot;Boxplot of Words vs GROUP.&quot; The vertical axis is labeled &quot;Words,&quot; and the
horizontal axis is labeled &quot;GROUP.&quot; We see that Group 3 has the smallest Q1 to Q3 interval,
and that Q2 is far below the mean. Group 2 has a larger Q1 to Q3 interval, and Group 1 has the largest
Q1 to Q3 interval, and a Q2 above its mean. Since the box plots are all centered at about the same word
count, the larger Q1 to Q3 intervals cover the smaller ones."/>

            <p>(ii) The graph does not display any alarming violations of the normality assumption.
                It seems like there is some skewness in groups 2 and 3, but not extremely so, and
                there are no outliers in the data.</p>
            <p>(iii) We can assume that the equal standard deviation assumption is met since the
                rule of thumb is satisfied: the largest sample standard deviation of the three is 74
                (group 1), the smallest one is 57.6 (group 3), and 74/57.6 &lt; 2.</p>
            <p>Before we move on, let's look again at the graph. It is easy to see the trend of the
                sample means (indicated by red circles). However, there is so much variation within
                each of the groups that there is almost a complete overlap between the three
                boxplots, and the differences between the means are over-shadowed and seem like
                something that could have happened just by chance. Let's move on and see whether the
                ANOVA F-test will support this observation.</p>
            <p>Using statistical software to conduct the ANOVA F-test, we find that the F<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100320-0500"?>

                is 1.18, which is not very large. We also find that the p-value is 0.317.</p>

            <p>Step 3. Finding the
                p-value<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100329-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?></p>
            <p>The p-value is
                0.317<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100333-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                which tells us that getting data like those observed is not very surprising assuming
                that there are no differences between the three magazine groups with respect to the
                mean number of words in ads (which is what
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100354-0500"?>H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100352-0500" content="Ho"?>
                claims).</p>
            <p>In other words, the large p-value tells us that it is quite reasonable that the
                differences between the observed sample means could have happened just by chance
                (i.e., due to sampling variability) and not because of true differences between the
                means.</p>
            <p>Step 4: <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100413-0500"?>Making
                <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100417-0500" content="C"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100417-0500"?>c<?oxy_insert_end?>onclusion<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100419-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>

                context<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100408-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?></p>
            <p>The large p-value indicates that the results are not significant, and that we cannot
                reject
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100428-0500"?>H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T100426-0500" content="Ho"?>.</p>
            <p>We therefore conclude that the study does not provide evidence that the mean number
                of words in ads is related to the educational level of the magazine. In other words,
                the study does not provide evidence that advertisers alter the reading level of
                their ads (as measured by the number of words) based on the educational level of the
                target audience of the magazine.</p>
