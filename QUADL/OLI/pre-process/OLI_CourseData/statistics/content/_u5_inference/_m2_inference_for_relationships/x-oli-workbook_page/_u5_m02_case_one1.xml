The possible pairings are: Categorical Explanatory ? Categorical Response (C?C), Categorical Explanatory ? Quantitative Response (C?Q) (highlighted to show we will work on this case), Quantitative Explanatory ? Categorical Response (Q?C), and Quantitative Explanatory ? Quantitative Response (Q?Q)." style="block" vertical-align="middle"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="c241ab474a0f4ddd9ae01dff202cfb00">We start with case C?Q, where the explanatory variable is categorical and the response variable is quantitative. Recall that in the Exploratory Data
 Analysis unit, examining the relationship between X
 and Y in this case amounts, in practice, to
 comparing the distributions of the (quantitative)
 response Y for each value (category) of the
 explanatory X. To do that, we used side-by-side
 boxplots (each representing the distribution of Y in
 one of the groups defined by X), and supplemented
 the display with the corresponding descriptive
 statistics.</p><p id="f75ab091bcae4ce1bee2b57a63138967">What will we do in inference? To understand the logic, we&apos;ll start with an example and then generalize.</p><example id="efd394c932654d0dac27431c6b8fbb1d"><title>GPA and Year in College</title><p id="db2c3c4608bb420ea134229a6099dd12">Say that our variable of interest is the GPA of college students in the United States. From the previous module we know that since GPA is
 quantitative, we do inference on ?, the
 (population) mean GPA among all U.S. college
 students. Since this module is about
 relationships, let&apos;s assume that what we are
 really interested in is not simply GPA, but the
 relationship between:</p><p id="a547b95dabbb4fa48d57c9c5adec42d4"><em style="italic">X :</em> year in college (1 = freshmen, 2 = sophomore, 3 = junior, 4 = senior) and</p><p id="f46a3a8f495746bfb0acfd41719a413c"><em style="italic">Y :</em> GPA</p><p id="bd03be7b83a046e0a0b6951da7f286f4">In other words, we want to explore whether GPA is related to year in college. The way to think about this is that the population of U.S. college
 students is now broken into <em style="italic">4 sub-populations</em>: freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. Within each of these four
 groups, we are interested in the GPA.</p><p id="ecc37cc448c24bd8a5bf1f59bc0b314f">The inference must therefore involve the 4 sub-population means:</p><p id="ea424b05806c4a6485ac7f5a5f7a21fa"> ?<sub>1</sub> : mean GPA among freshmen in the United States.</p><p id="e32a30f4c77842d987908a2cd07a424e">?<sub>2</sub> : mean GPA among sophomores in the United States </p><p id="b5c15c7884dc4c258e84424637ad8e12">?<sub>3</sub> : mean GPA among juniors in the United States</p><p id="e5cb46cf0df34b0d89bdcd99a7340b0a"> ?<sub>4</sub> : mean GPA among seniors in the United States</p><p id="bcab4627d1394673adeeef67c78d8bb6">It makes sense that the inference about the relationship between year and GPA has to be based on some kind of comparison of these four means. If we
 infer that these four means are not all equal
 (i.e., that there are some differences in GPA
 across years in college) then that&apos;s equivalent to
 saying GPA is related to year in college. Let&apos;s
 summarize this example with a figure:</p><image id="b371df1f41824e748722bb7082648e02" src="../webcontent/image010.gif" alt="The entire population of US College Students is represented by a large circle. For this population we would like to know if GPA (Y) and Year (X) are related. This population is made of 4-sub populations. This is represented by 4 arrows from the population circle to 4 other circles. A circle exists for US Freshmen, with GPA mean ?_1. Another circle exists for US Sophomores, with GPA Mean ?_2. US Juniors has another circle with GPA Mean ?_3. The last circle is for US Seniors, with GPA Mean ?_4. To infer on relationship we&amp;apos;ll need to compare each of these means." style="block" vertical-align="middle"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image></example><p id="bccb9ca780bc474bb77985e40260ee4f">In general, then, making inferences about the relationship between X and Y in Case C?Q boils down to comparing the means of Y in the sub-populations,
 which are created by the categories defined in X
 (say k categories). The following figure summarizes
 this:</p><image id="a6d7a567e3094ef4b85e27052a73be23" src="../webcontent/image011.gif" alt="The entire population is represented by a large circle, for which we wonder if there is a relationship between Y and X. This large population is broken up into sub-populations, each with its own mean ?. To infer on relationship between Y and X, we&amp;apos;ll need to compare these means." style="block" vertical-align="middle"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="f4ab28eeeb1a4e99bdaed150b423125e">As the introduction to this module mentioned, we will learn three inferential methods in Case C?Q, corresponding to a sub-division of this case.
 First we will distinguish between cases where the
 explanatory X has only two categories (k = 2), and
 cases where X has more than two categories (k &gt;
 2). In other words, we will look separately at cases
 where we are comparing two sub-population means:</p><image id="f8fece41a30842fdb469ae30290bfe0c" src="../webcontent/image012.gif" alt="We have a population for which we want to know if there is a relationship between Y and X. k = 2 in this case, so we have two sub-populations, each with its own Y Mean. Sub-Population 1 has a Y Mean of ?_1, and Sub-Population 2 has a Y Mean of ?_2. To infer on relationship we&amp;apos;ll need to compare these TWO means." style="block" vertical-align="middle"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="a5ab861d1cf141c7be10e6de10de459b">and cases where we are comparing more than 2 sub-population means:</p><image id="eb1119ba493b4de4911972bcf1129b22" src="../webcontent/image013.gif" alt="The entire population is represented by a large circle, for which we wonder if there is a relationship between Y and X. k &amp;gt; 2. This large population is broken up into k sub-populations, each with its own mean ?. To infer on relationship between Y and X, we&amp;apos;ll need to compare these k means." style="block" vertical-align="middle"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="a683d1cd94a24435a88c78df3339ef9b">For example, if we are interested in whether GPA (Y) is related to gender (X), this is a case where <em style="italic">k = 2</em> (since gender has only two categories: M, F), and the inference will boil down
 to comparing the mean GPA in the sub-population of males
 to that in the sub-population of females. On the other
 hand, in the example we looked at earlier, the
 relationship between GPA (Y) and year (X) is a case
 where <em style="italic">k &gt; 2</em> or more specifically, k = 4 (since year has four categories). In terms of
 inference, these two examples will be treated
 differently!</p></body></workbook_page>
