            <p>(i) Survey random samples of 40 seniors, 40 juniors, 40 sophomores, and 40 freshmen,
                and get them to report the number of credits they are taking. Sample standard
                deviations are 3.1, 3.4, 1.9, and 2.7.</p>
            <p>(ii) Survey random samples of 20 seniors, 20 juniors, 20 sophomores, and 20 freshmen,
                and get them to report the number of credits they are taking. Sample standard
                deviations are 3.1, 5.4, 1.9, and 2.7.</p>
            <p>Which of the above two designs should not be handled with ANOVA?</p>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Note that in design (ii) the largest among the sample standard
                    deviations (5.4) is more than twice as large as the smallest one (1.9). Since
                    this rule of the thumb is not satisfied, we cannot assume that condition (iii)
                    of equal population standard deviations is satisfied, and cannot therefore use
                    ANOVA. In design (i), the rule of thumb is satisfied (3.4<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101129T094509-0500"?>

                <feedback>Correct. Indeed, the largest among the sample standard deviations (5.4) is
                    more than twice as large as the smallest one (1.9). Since this rule of thumb is
                    not satisfied, we cannot assume that condition (iii) of equal population
