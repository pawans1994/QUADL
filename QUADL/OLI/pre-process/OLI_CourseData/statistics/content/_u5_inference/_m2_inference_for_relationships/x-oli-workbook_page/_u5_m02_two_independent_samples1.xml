            <title>Comparing Two Means&#8212;Two Independent Samples (The Two-Sample t-Test)</title>

                    <title>Overview</title>
                    <body>
                        <p>As we mentioned in the summary of the introduction to Case C→Q, the first case
                    that we will deal with is comparing two means when the two samples are
                    independent:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image014.gif" alt="Sub-Population 1 has a
Y Mean of &mu;_1, and Sub-Population 2 has a Y Mean of &mu;_2. From Sub-population 1 we take an
SRS of size n_1, and from Sub-population 2 we take an SRS of size n_2. Both of these samples are
independent."/>
                <p>Recall that here we are interested in the effect of a two-valued (k = 2)
                    categorical variable (X) on a quantitative response (Y). Samples are drawn
                    independently from the two sub-populations (defined by the two categories of X),
                    and we need to evaluate whether or not the data provide enough evidence for us
                    to believe that the two sub-population means are different. </p>
                <p> In other words, our goal is to test whether the means μ<sub>1</sub> and
                        μ<sub>2</sub> (which are the means of the variable of interest in the two
                    sub-populations) are equal or not, and in order to do that we have two samples, one
                    from each sub-population, which were chosen independently of each other. As the
                    title of this part suggests, the test that we will learn here is commonly known
                    as the <em>two-sample t-test</em>. As the name suggests, this is a t-test, which
                    as we know means that the p-values for this test are calculated under some t
                    distribution. Here is how this part is organized. </p>
                <p>We first introduce our leading example, and then go in detail through the four
                    steps of the two-sample t-test, illustrating each step using our example.</p>

                <pullout type="note">
                    <p>Up until now, we have been dividing our population into <em>sub-populations</em>, then sampling from these sub-populations.</p>
                <p>From now on, instead of calling them sub-populations, we will usually call the groups we wish to compare <em>population 1, population 2, </em>and so on.  These two 
                descriptions of the groups we are comparing can be used interchangeably.</p>
                <!--<p>The number will be determined by the number of values the explanatory categorical variable (X) has.</p>-->

                <example>
                    <p>What is more important to you &#8212; personality or looks?</p>
                    <p>This question was asked of a random sample of 239 college students, who were
                        to answer on a scale of 1 to 25. An answer of 1 means personality has
                        maximum importance and looks no importance at all, whereas an answer of 25
                        means looks have maximum importance and personality no importance at all.
                        The purpose of this survey was to examine whether males and females differ
                        with respect to the importance of looks vs. personality.</p>

                    <p>The format of the data reminds us that we are essentially examining the
                        relationship between the two-valued categorical variable, gender, and the
                        quantitative response, score. The two values of the categorical explanatory
                        variable define the two populations that we are comparing &#8212; males and
                        females. The comparison is with respect to the response variable score. Here
                        is a figure that summarizes the example:</p>
                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image018.gif" alt="We have two populations,
Females and Males. This is our Gender (X) Variable. For each of these populations, there is a Score (Y)
mean, &mu;_1 for Females and &mu;_2 for Males. For the Female population we generate an SRS of size 150.
For Males, we generate a SRS of size 85."/>
                    <p>
                        <em>Comments:</em>
                    </p>
                    <ol><li><p>Note that this figure emphasizes how the fact that our explanatory is a
                        two-valued categorical variable means that in practice we are comparing two
                        populations (defined by these two values) with respect to our response
                        Y.</p></li>
                 <li>   <p>Note that even though the problem description just says that we had 239
                        students, the figure tells us that there were 85 males in the sample, and
                        150 females.</p></li>
                   <li> <p>Following up on comment 2, note that 85 + 150 = 235 and not 239. In these data (which are
                                real) there are four "missing observations"&#8212;4 students for
                                which we do not have the value of the response variable,
                                "importance." This could be due to a number of reasons, such as
                                recording error or nonresponse. The bottom line is that even though
                                data were collected from 239 students, effectively we have data from
                                only 235. (Recommended: Go through the data file and note that there
                                are 4 cases of missing observations: students 34, 138, 179, and
                                183).</p></li></ol>
