            <p>Suppose an economist wishes to determine the relationship between the age and price
                of houses. A study yields the following data:</p>

            <p>If column 1 is the price (in hundreds of thousands of dollars) of a sample of five houses from
                ten years ago, and column 2 is the price (in hundreds of thousands of dollars) of a sample of a
                different five houses from today, which of the following is the appropriate
                inference method to analyze these data?</p>
