            <p>In a study of the legibility and visibility of highway signs, a Pennsylvania research
                firm determined the maximum distance at which each of 30 drivers could read a newly
                designed sign. The 30 participants in the study ranged in age from 18 to 82 years
                old. The government agency that funded the research hoped to improve highway safety
                for older drivers and wanted to examine the relationship between age and

            <p>The researchers would now like to see whether the observed linear relationship
                between age and legibility distance can be generalized to the entire population of
                drivers. In other words, the researchers want to check whether the observed
                linearity is due to true linearity in the population, or a pattern that could have
                happened just by chance.</p>
            <p>The test that the researchers are going to carry out is a t-test (most commonly known
                as the "t-test for the slope" for reasons that we are not going to get into) which

                    we'll just say that the

                    is a

                    means that the null distribution of its test statistic (under which the p-values

                    <?oxy_insert_end?>some<?oxy_comment_end?> of the <em>conditions</em> that allow
                    us to safely use this t-test. They are:</p>

                    <li>the observed data indeed look linear (otherwise it would not make sense to

                    <li>the observations are independent</li>
                    <li>there are no extreme outliers in the data</li>
                    <li>the sample size is fairly large</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note that in our example all these conditions are met; the data definitely look
                    linear, the observations (drivers) are independent of each other (since they
                    were randomly chosen), there are no extreme observations in the data, and a

                    to get data like those observed if

                    or -1 for a strong linear relationship, close to 0 for a weak linear

                <p>In our example, since the p-value is 0.000 and r = -.801, we would say that we
