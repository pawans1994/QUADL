Sample Means / Variation Within Groups"/>
                <p>It has a different structure from all the test statistics we've looked at so far,
                    but it is similar in that it is still a measure of the evidence against
                        H<sub>0</sub>. The larger F is (which happens when the denominator, the
                    variation within groups, is small relative to the numerator, the variation among
                    the sample means), the more evidence we have against H<sub>0</sub>.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><p>The focus here is for you to understand the idea behind this test
                            statistic, so we do not go into detail about how the two variations are
                            measured. <!--We are not going to go into any of the details about how the
                            two variations are measured. This will be included in an extension
                            module to this course in the future.<?oxy_comment_start ="is this still in the future, 
                            or is this extension now available? "?> <?oxy_comment_end?> -->We instead rely 
                            on software output to obtain the F-statistic.</p></li>
                    <li><p>This test is called the ANOVA F-test. So far, we have explained the ANOVA
                            part of the name. Based on the previous tests we introduced, it should
                            not be surprising that the "F-test" part comes from the fact that the
                            null distribution of the test statistic, under which the p-values are
                            calculated, is called an F-distribution. We will say very little about
                            the F-distribution in this course, which will essentially be limited to
                            this comment and the next one.</p></li>
                    <li><p>It is fairly straightforward to decide if a z-statistic is large. Even
                            without tables, we should realize by now that a z-statistic of 0.8 is
                            not especially large, whereas a z-statistic of 2.5 is large. In the case
                            of the t-statistic, it is less straightforward, because there is a
                            different t-distribution for every sample size n (and degrees of freedom
                            n − 1). However, the fact that a t-distribution with a large number of
                            degrees of freedom is very close to the z (standard normal) distribution
                            can help to assess the magnitude of the t-test statistic.</p>
                        <p>When the size of the F-statistic must be assessed, the task is even more
                            complicated, because there is a different F-distribution for every
                            combination of the number of groups we are comparing and the total
                            sample size. We will nevertheless say that for most situations, an
                            F-statistic greater than 4 would be considered rather large, but tables
                            or software are needed to get a truly accurate assessment.</p></li>

                </example>
                <p>Let's move on to talk about the conditions under which we can safely use the
                    ANOVA F-test, where the first two conditions are very similar to ones we've seen
                    before, but there is a new third condition. It is safe to use the ANOVA
                    procedure when the following conditions hold:</p>
                <ol style="lower-roman">
                    <li>
                        <p>The samples drawn from each of the populations we're comparing are
                            independent.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The response variable varies normally within each of the populations
                            we're comparing. As you already know, in practice this is done by
                            looking at the histograms of the samples and making sure that there is
                            no evidence of extreme departure from normality in the form of extreme
                            skewness and outliers. Another possibility is to look at side-by-side
                            boxplots of the data, and add histograms if a more detailed view is
                            necessary. For large sample sizes, we don't really need to worry about
                            normality, although it is always a good idea to look at the
                        data.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The populations all have the same standard deviation. The best we can do
                            to check this condition is to find the <em>sample</em> standard
                            deviations of our samples and check whether they are "close." A common
                            rule of thumb is to check whether the ratio between the largest sample
                            standard deviation and the smallest is less than 2. If that's the case,
                            this condition is considered to be satisfied.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <example>
                    <p>In our example all the conditions are satisfied:</p>
                    <ol style="lower-roman">
                        <li><p>All the samples were chosen randomly, and are therefore
                                independent.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The sample sizes are large enough (n = 35) that we really don't have
                                to worry about the normality; however, let's look at the data using
                                side-by-side boxplots, just to get a sense of it:</p>
                            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image114.gif"
                                alt="Four box plots titled
&quot;Boxplots of Frustration by Major.&quot; The mean for business is about 7, for English about 12,
for mathematics about 13, and for psychology about 14. The interval between the first and third quartile
for each major is about 7 or less. We also see that the box plot for business does not contain any other
major's mean in its first and third quartile interval. We also see that no other majors' first and third
quartile interval includes business's mean. In fact, they don't even include its third quartile."/>
                            <p>You'll recognize this plot as Scenario 2 from earlier. The data
                                suggest that the frustration level of the business students is
                                generally lower than students from the other three majors. The ANOVA
                                F-test will tell us whether these differences are
                            significant.</p></li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In order to use the rule of thumb, we need to get the sample standard
                                deviations of our samples.</p></li>

                    number of credits taken by freshmen versus sophomores versus juniors versus seniors. In
                    each case, one of the designs should not be handled with ANOVA. Your task is to
                    identify which of the two it is.</p>
