            <title>The Chi-Square Test for Independence</title>
            <body>
                <p>The chi-square test for independence examines our observed data and tells us
                    whether we have enough evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that two
                    categorical variables are related. Much like the previous part on the ANOVA
                    F-test, we are going to introduce the hypotheses (step 1), and then discuss the
                    idea behind the test, which will naturally lead to the test statistic (step 2).
                    Let's start.</p>

        <section>
            <title>Step 1: Stating the hypotheses</title>
            <body>


                <p>Unlike all the previous tests that we presented, the null and alternative
                    hypotheses in the chi-square test are stated in words rather than in terms of
                    population parameters. They are:</p>
                <p>
                    <em>H<sub>o</sub></em>: There is no relationship between the two categorical
                    variables. (They are independent.)</p>
                <p>
                    <em>H<sub>a</sub></em>: There is a relationship between the two categorical
                    variables. (They are not independent.)</p>
                <example>

                    <p>In our example, the null and alternative hypotheses would then state:</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>H<sub>o</sub></em>: There is no relationship between gender and drunk
                        driving.</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>H<sub>a</sub></em>: There is a relationship between gender and drunk
                        driving.</p>
                    <p>Or equivalently,</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>H<sub>o</sub></em>: Drunk driving and gender are independent</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>H<sub>a</sub></em>: Drunk driving and gender are not independent</p>

            <title>Comment</title>
            <body>
                <p>Algebraically, independence between gender and driving drunk is equivalent to
                    having equal proportions who drank (or did not drink) for males vs. females. In
                    fact, the null and alternative hypotheses could have been re-formulated as</p>
                <p>
                    <em>H<sub>o</sub>:</em> proportion of male drunk drivers = proportion of female
                    drunk drivers</p>
                <p>
                    <em> H<sub>a</sub>: </em>proportion of male drunk drivers ≠ proportion of female
                    drunk drivers </p>
                <p>However, expressing the hypotheses in terms of proportions works well and is
                    quite intuitive for two-by-two tables, but the formulation becomes very
                    cumbersome when at least one of the variables has several possible values, not
                    just two. We are therefore going to always stick with the "wordy" form of the
                    hypotheses presented in step 1 above.</p>

            <title>The Idea of the Chi-Square Test</title>
            <body>
                <p>The idea behind the chi-square test, much like previous tests that we've
                    introduced, is to measure how far the data are from what is claimed in the null
                    hypothesis. The further the data are from the null hypothesis, the more evidence
                    the data presents against it. We'll use our data to develop this idea. Our data
                    are represented by the observed counts:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image131.gif"
                    alt="The two-way table with counts. The cells
which are not in a Total row or column are the observed counts. Full description: A two-way table,
in which the columns are labeled &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;No,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; The rows
are labeled &quot;Male,&quot; &quot;Female,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; Here is the data in the table,
given in cell format (&quot;Row, Column: Value&quot;):
         Male, Yes: 77;
         Male, No: 404;
         Male, Total: 481;
         Female, Yes: 16;
         Female, No: 122;
         Female, Total: 138;
         Total, Yes: 93;
         Total, No: 526;
         Total, Total: 619;

The observed counts are Male, Yes;
          Male, No;
          Female, Yes;
          Female, No;
"/>
                <p>How will we represent the null hypothesis?</p>
                <p>In the previous tests we introduced, the null hypothesis was represented by the
                    null value. Here there is not really a null value, but rather a claim that the
                    two categorical variables (drunk driving and gender, in this case) are
                    independent.</p>
                <p>To represent the null hypothesis, we will calculate another set of counts &#8212;
                    the counts that we would expect to see (instead of the observed ones) if drunk
                    driving and gender were really independent (i.e., if H<sub>o</sub> were true).
                    For example, we actually observed 77 males who drove drunk; if drunk driving and
                    gender were indeed independent (if H<sub>o</sub> were true), how many male drunk
                    drivers would we expect to see instead of 77? Similarly, we can ask the same
                    kind of question about (and calculate) the other three cells in our table.</p>
                <p>In other words, we will have two sets of counts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>the observed counts (the data)</p></li>

                    <li><p>the expected counts (if H<sub>o</sub> were true)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will measure how far the observed counts are from the expected ones.
                    Ultimately, we will base our decision on the size of the discrepancy between
                    what we observed and what we would expect to observe if H<sub>o</sub> were
                    true.</p>
                <p>How are the expected counts calculated? Once again, we are in need of probability
                    results. Recall from the probability section that if events A and B are
                    independent, then P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). We use this rule for calculating
                    expected counts, one cell at a time. </p>
                <p>Here again are the observed counts:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image132.gif"
                    alt="A two-way table,
in which the columns are labeled &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;No,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; The rows
are labeled &quot;Male,&quot; &quot;Female,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; Here is the data in the table,
given in cell format (&quot;Row, Column: Value&quot;):
         Male, Yes: 77;
         Male, No: 404;
         Male, Total: 481;
         Female, Yes: 16;
         Female, No: 122;
         Female, Total: 138;
         Total, Yes: 93;
         Total, No: 526;
         Total, Total: 619;"/>
                <p>Applying the rule to the first (top left) cell, if driving drunk and gender were
                    independent then: </p>
                <p> P(drunk and male) = P(drunk) * P(male)</p>
                <p>By dividing the counts in our table, we see that:</p>
                <p>P(Drunk) = 93 / 619 and</p>
                <p>P(Male) = 481 / 619,</p>
                <p>and so,</p>
                <p>P(Drunk and Male) = (93 / 619) (481 / 619)</p>
                <p>Therefore, since there are total of 619 drivers, <em>if drunk driving and gender
                        were independent</em>, the <em>count </em>of drunk male drivers that I would
                        <em>expect</em> to see is:</p>

                <p>A study was done on the relationship between gender and piercing among
                    high-school students. A sample of 1,000 students was chosen, then classified
                    according to gender and according to whether or not they had any of their ears
                    pierced. The results of the study are summarized in the following 2-by-2
                    table:</p>

        <p>We see that there are differences between the observed and expected counts in the
            respective cells. We now have to come up with a measure that will quantify these
            differences. This is the chi-square test statistic.</p>
