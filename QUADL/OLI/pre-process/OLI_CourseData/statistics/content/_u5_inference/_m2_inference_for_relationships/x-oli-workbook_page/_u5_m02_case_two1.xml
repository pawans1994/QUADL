The case (Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 1976) was ultimately heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p id="cbb4abb9701b4352905e2a4a9586ff2c">The main justification provided by Oklahoma for the law was traffic safety. One of the 3 main pieces of data presented to the court was the result of a &quot;random roadside survey&quot; that recorded information on gender, and whether or not the driver had been drinking alcohol in the previous two hours. There were a total of 619 drivers under 20 years of age included in the survey.</p><p id="f867013fb4164ddf99c38cbda3a4651a">Here is what the collected data looked like:</p><image id="f0cd44c8f2004fb493a50720e041f4d3" src="../webcontent/image126.gif" alt="A table with two columns, &amp;quot;Gender,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Drove drunk?.&amp;quot; Each row represents one occurrence.

The results from this survey are summarized in the two-way table given above. Using Inference, we can figure out if the relationship of the roadside survey strong enough that we can conclude that it is due to a real relationship between drunk driving and gender in population." style="block" vertical-align="middle"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="de7cb5d0877946748f130a797db595bc">Note that as the figure stresses, since we are looking to see whether drunk driving is related to gender, our explanatory variable (X) is gender, and the response variable (Y) is drunk driving. Both variables are two-valued categorical variables, and therefore our two-way table of observed counts is 2-by-2. It should be mentioned that the chi-square procedure that we are going to introduce here is not limited to 2-by-2 situations, but can be applied to any r-by-c situation where r is the number of rows (corresponding to the number of values of one of the variables) and c is the number of columns (corresponding to the number of values of the other variable).</p><p id="a06b4f254f0c4af6b89906be8337c1be">Before we introduce the chi-square test, let&apos;s conduct an exploratory data analysis (that is, look at the data to get an initial feel for it). By doing that, we will also get a better conceptual understanding of the role of the test.</p><p id="ff5adc0dfdda48db9f1c5deeb1e26d8a"><em>Exploratory Analysis</em></p><p id="ac1baf354b094abf9d2b3125ec1479d8">Recall that the key to reporting appropriate summaries for a two-way table is deciding which of the two categorical variables plays the role of explanatory variable, and then calculating the conditional percentages — the percentages of the response variable for each value of the explanatory variable — separately. In this case, since the explanatory variable is gender, we would calculate the percentages of drivers who did (and did not) drink alcohol for males and females separately.</p><p id="cf5183bf2b924799851ac71057adb30b">Here is the table of conditional percentages:</p><image id="ede30df4120f4f78ae32ecfea195391c" src="../webcontent/image129.gif" alt="A two-way table, in which the columns are labeled &amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; (in response to the Y variable, drank alcohol in the last 2 hours) and &amp;quot;Total.&amp;quot; The rows are labeled &amp;quot;Male&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Female.&amp;quot; Here is the data in the table, give in cell format (&amp;quot;Row, Column: Value&amp;quot;):         Male, Yes: 77/481 = 16.0%         Male, No: 404/481 = 84.0%         Male, Total: 100%         Female, Yes: 16/138 = 11.6%         Female, No: 122/138 = 88.4%         Female, Total: 100%" style="block" vertical-align="middle"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="dddc75e08287406eb9c8138e3fba3018">For the 619 sampled drivers, a larger percentage of males were found to be drunk than females (16.0% vs. 11.6%). Our data, in other words, provide some evidence that drunk driving is related to gender; however, this in itself is not enough to conclude that such a relationship exists in the larger population of drivers under 20. We need to further investigate the data and decide between the following two points of view:</p><ul id="b34a35514f2d42ba9a033e8f3f73a8f6"><li><p id="dc1a5454306548fea363e5b7ce912866">The evidence provided by the roadside survey (16% vs 11.6%) is strong enough to conclude (beyond a reasonable doubt) that it must be due to a relationship between drunk driving and gender in the population of drivers under 20.</p></li><li><p id="e26edf6367304ff58e4180811d372dde">The evidence provided by the roadside survey (16% vs. 11.6%) is not strong enough to make that conclusion, and could have happened just by chance, due to sampling variability, and not necessarily because a relationship exists in the population.</p></li></ul></example><p id="dd7069d6cbd944108e36bab158aa28df">Actually, these two opposing points of view constitute the null and alternative hypotheses of the chi-square test for independence, so now that we understand our example and what we still need to find out, let&apos;s introduce the four-step process of this test.</p></body></section><section id="ae39a0e3ba3f437784cc5632608f94af" purpose="learnbydoing"><title>Learn By Doing</title><body><p id="d4d7cc149065496d883567a63845e03a">The purpose of this activity is to introduce you to the example that you are going to work through in this section, and for you to get a feeling for the data by conducting exploratory analysis. </p><p id="a1d2f73d3ad5461180f5820df88f3d69">Background: Alcoholism Risk in 9/11 Responders</p><p id="fde7b57cee394d3b9661b9b2484839c6">Among firefighters and other &quot;first responders&quot; to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, there have been reports of increased alcohol-related difficulties (e.g., DUI).
