                        <p>The following is the scatterplot of the data:</p>

                                          million. In other words, the more southern the state, the
                                          higher the death rate. Note that since the response
                                          variable is the mortality per 10 million, it measures the
                                          death rate rather than the number of deaths.</feedback>

                                    <feedback>Correct. Since two of the six (or 33% of the)
                                          expected counts are less than 5 we should be concerned
                                          about the reliability of the results of the test. The fact
                                          that the random sample was not taken from among the entire
                                          university&apos;s students but from a smaller sampling frame of
                                          students in a chemical engineering course should not harm
                                          the reliability of the test results (since the sample is
                                          still random) but should just affect how general our
                                          conclusions can be.</feedback>
