            <p>Do oddsmakers believe that teams who play at home will have home field advantage?
                Specifically, do oddsmakers give higher point spreads when the favored team plays
                home games as compared to when the favored team plays away games?</p>
            <p>Two samples were randomly selected from three complete National Football League
                seasons (1989, 1990, and 1991). The first sample consisted of 50 games, where the
                favored team played in a home game, while the second sample consisted of 50 games,
                where the favored team played in an away game. The oddsmakers’ point spreads (which
                are the number of points by which the favored team is predicted to beat the weaker
                team) were then collected.</p>
            <p>If µ<sub>1</sub> and µ<sub>2</sub> represent the mean point spread for home games and
                away games, respectively, which of the following is the appropriate pair of
                hypotheses in this case?</p>

                college students who are not affiliated with a fraternity or sorority? A statistics
