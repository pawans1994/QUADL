            <p>A GRE course prep company advertises that its course can significantly raise
                students' GRE Verbal Reasoning scores. In order to assess the accuracy of this
                claim, a researcher randomly selected a sample of 30 graduating seniors from a local
                university, who were applying to business school.</p>
            <p>The 30 students first took the GRE, without any preparation. The 30 students then
                took the GRE again, after completing the GRE prep course. The researcher then
                compared the performance for each student to determine whether there was improvement
                on the GRE Verbal Reasoning scores from the first to second administrations.</p>

                    here we are comparing only two. Also, in ANOVA the samples are independent which
                    is not the case here. Since the same group of students was measured twice
                    (before and then after the GRE prep course) the samples are not

                <feedback>Incorrect. While it is correct that we’re comparing two groups, the

                    (before and then after the GRE prep course). A two-sample t-test should be used
