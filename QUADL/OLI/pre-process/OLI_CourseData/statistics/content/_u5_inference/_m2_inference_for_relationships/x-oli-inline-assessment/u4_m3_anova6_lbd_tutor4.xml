  <question id="q1">
    <body>Based on the graph that you produced for answering the previous question, summarize what
      the data suggest about how CFF is related to eye color. Do you think that the data provide
      enough evidence against the null hypothesis? (There is no right or wrong answer here, just
      your feelings from looking at the data.)</body>
    <short_answer id="A"/>
    <part>
      <response input="A" match="*" score="10"/>
      <explanation>The data suggest that the CFF of the people with brown eyes is the lowest (on
        average), followed by green-eyed people, and people with blue eyes have the highest CFF (on
        average). It seems like that there is a reasonable amount of evidence in the data against
          H<sub>o</sub>. The three boxplots do not overlap much, and it really doesn't seem very
        likely that the three populations from which these three samples were chosen all share the
        same mean. </explanation>
