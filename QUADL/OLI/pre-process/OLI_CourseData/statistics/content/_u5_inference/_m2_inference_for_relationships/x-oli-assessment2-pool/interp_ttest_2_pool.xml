            <p>A Canadian study measuring depression level in teens (as reported in the <em style="italic">Journal of Adolescence</em>, vol. 25, 2002) randomly sampled 112
                male teens and 101 female teens, and scored them on a common depression scale
                (higher score representing more depression). The researchers suspected that the mean
                depression score for male teens is higher than for female teens, and wanted to check
                whether data would support this hypothesis.</p>
            <p>The following hypotheses were tested:</p>
            <p>H<sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub> = μ<sub>2</sub></p>
            <p>H<sub>a</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub> &gt; μ<sub>2</sub></p>
            <p>The following is the (edited) output for the test:</p>
