                <p>We are now ready to carry out the significance test, which will assess the
                    significance of the relationship between the risk of alcohol problems and
                    participation in the 9/11 rescue. Which of the following are the appropriate
                    hypotheses for the chi-square test for independence in this case?</p>

                        That is, the null hypothesis can be no relationship between the two
                        variables and the alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant

                    <feedback>Correct. Either format can be used to describe the null and

                        to state that the null hypothesis can be no relationship between the two

                        null hypothesis is that the two variables are independent and the
                        alternative hypothesis is the two variables are not independent.</feedback>
