	<title>How Regression Analysis may be used</title>
	
	
</head>
<body>
    
    <p>Consider the following three scenarios where relationships between variables are explored:</p>
    <ol style="upper-roman">
        <li>At the end of the semester, an instructor analyzed the data in her grade-book. In particular, the instructor explored how a student’s final score is related to (or can be predicted using) the student’s two midterm scores, the students HW average, and whether or not the student did the extra credit assignment.</li>
        <li>A health scientist explored the relationship between a person’s age (X) and whether or not the person gets flu shot (Y)</li>
        <li>A study was done in order to explore how well the number of beers a person drinks predicts his or her blood alcohol content</li>
    </ol>
