	<p>The purpose of this activity is to give you your first “hands-on” experience in working with  complex data sets in the sense that there are several explanatory variables, and give you practice in using exploratory data analysis in order to get a first feel the relationship among the variables.</p>
	<p>The <em style = "italic">National Assessment of Educational Progress </em>(NAEP) is a Congressionally mandated survey administered by the Department of Education.  Since 1969, NAEP has reported on the educational achievement of American students in a number of academic disciplines.  NAEP has become an integral part of our nation's evaluation of the condition and progress of education.</p>
	<p>The 1994 NAEP survey had a reading component to assess and report the educational progress of students at grades 4, 8, and 12.  In this activity, we will only investigate the reading achievement of fourth graders.  The 1994 NAEP assessment was based on a national probability sample of public and non-public school students.  This sampling process resulted in the selection of a national sample consisting of approximately 7,400 fourth grade students. </p>
	<p><link href="../../webcontent/minitab/naep.mtw" target="new">Download the data set.</link></p>
	<p>The data we consider here are the average proficiency reading score reported for each of the 41individual states that chose to participate in NAEP.</p>
	<p>The variables in the data set are:</p>
	<table rowstyle="plain">
		<tr>
			<th>State</th>
			<td>There are 41 participating states.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>R.score</th>
			<td>This is the average state reading proficiency score.  It takes values between 0 -- 500.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>TV6</th>
			<td>proportion of students who watch 6 or more hours of TV a week.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Poor</th>
			<td>proportion of students living in disadvantaged urban areas.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Parents</th>
			<td>proportion of students whose parents went to college.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>In this activity, we are interested in explaining the variability in the response variable R.score using the explanatory variables, TV6, Poor and Parents, which are all quantitative. In particular, in this activity we will conduct the exploratory data analysis. </p>
	<p>To obtain the matrix plot in Minitab:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Choose Basic Statistics &#x2192; Correlation. </li>
		<li>Under ‘Variables’, enter the response and three explanatory variables.</li>
		<li>Unclick ‘Display p-values’, and click ok.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Using the correlation matrix and matrix plot, conduct exploratory data analysis for these data. In particular, address the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What is the direction of the relationship between the response and each of the explanatory variables. Is this what you would expect?</li>
		<li>Which of the explanatory variables has the strongest relationship with the response?</li>
		<li>Which pair of explanatory variables is the most correlated? </li>
	</ul>
