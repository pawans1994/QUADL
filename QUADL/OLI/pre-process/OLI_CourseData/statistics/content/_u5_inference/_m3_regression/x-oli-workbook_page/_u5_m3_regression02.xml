		<p>So far, we’ve dealt with the case where we have only one explanatory variable, X, and one
			response variable, Y, both of which were quantitative. Broadly speaking, our two main
			goals were:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Explore the nature of the relationship between X and Y and assess whether we can
				generalize the observed pattern from the sample to the entire population.</li>
			<li>Assess the importance of the explanatory variable X as a predictor for Y, and
				quantify the strength of such a prediction. </li>
		</ol>

		<p>As you remember, what enabled us to pursue our goals and was at the center of our entire
			analysis was the <em>statistical model</em>. As we discussed, this model is a simple
			approximation for how variables relate in the population which made sense based on the
			observed data.</p>
		<p>When the observed the following pattern in the data:</p>
		<image style="block" src="../webcontent/_u5_m3_img02.gif"
			alt="scatterplot showing a straight linear relationship"/>
		<p>It made sense to assume the simple linear regression model:</p>
		<image style="block" src="../webcontent/_u5_m3_img03.gif"
			alt="formula: y equals beta sub 0 plus beta sub 1 x plus epsilon"/>
		<p>which assumes that the relationship between X and Y in the population follows a linear
			pattern, and that the data points follow this general pattern but not perfectly; we
			recognized that there are some deviations from the pattern. We further made some
			assumptions about the behavior of the deviations, and in particular we quantified their
			magnitude by their standard deviation &sigma;.</p>
		<p>When we observed the following pattern in the data,</p>
		<image style="block" src="../webcontent/_u5_m3_img04.gif"
			alt="scatterplot showing a curved relationship starting in the upper left corner moving down and curving back up slightly in the lower right."/>
		<p>It made sense to assume the quadratic regression model:</p>
		<image style="block" src="../webcontent/_u5_m3_img05.gif"
			alt="formula: y equals beta sub 0 plus beta sub 1 x plus beta sub 2 x squared plus epsilon"/>
		<p>which assumes that the relationship between X and Y in the population follows a <em
				style="italic">quadratic</em> pattern, and, again, that the data points follow this
			general pattern but not perfectly.</p>
		<p>In the remainder of this regression module, we are moving <em>multiple regression</em>,
			where we explore the relationship between the response variable Y and several
			explanatory variables: X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, …,X<sub>k</sub>, . We will ask
			interesting questions such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How can we use all the explanatory variables <em style="italic">collectively</em> to
				predict the response Y?</li>
			<li>Are all out explanatory variables really relevant (or important) for the purpose of
				predicting Y?</li>
			<li>Do all the explanatory variables have to be quantitative, or can we include some
				categorical explanatory variables as well?</li>
			<li>If we start with a lot of explanatory variables, is there some systematic method
				that will give us the “best” subset of explanatory variables among them.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The only down side of multiple regression compared to dealing with only one explanatory
			variable is that we loose the ability to easily visualize all data in a way that will
			lead us to coming up with a statistical model that makes sense. To illustrate this
			point, consider the following hypothetical example.</p>

		<example>
			<p>In an effort to be able to effectively predict a students’ score in a second
				statistics course (Stats2), an instructor collected data from 100 students who have
				just completed the course. </p>
			<ul style="none">
				<li>The two explanatory variables are: <ul>
						<li>X<sub>1</sub> – SAT-M score</li>
						<li>X<sub>2</sub> – Stats 1 course score,</li>
					</ul></li>
				<li>and the response: <ul>
						<li>Y- Stats2 course score</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<image style="block" src="../webcontent/_u5_m3_img06.gif"
				alt="data table displaying raw data for all variables"/>
			<p>In this, simplest case of multiple regression (in the sense that we have only two
				explanatory variables), we can plot the data in a a “3D scatterplot”:</p>
			<image style="block" src="../webcontent/_u5_m3_img07.gif"
				alt="3D scatterplot displaying the relationship of y to both explanatory variables"/>
			<p>However, as you can see there is really not much information that we can gain from
				looking at the graph regarding the relationship between X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>
				and Y, and in particular, the plot does not help us in determining what would be a
				reasonable model to use.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, once we add another, third, explanatory variable, then there is really
				no way that we can visualize the entire data.</p>
			<p>As we’ll see there are ways to “overcome” this problem and the do the best we
				can.</p>
			<p>On the upside, multiple regression will allow us to analyze much more complex
				datasets and will further expose us to the power of data analysis in extracting
				useful information from data.</p>
