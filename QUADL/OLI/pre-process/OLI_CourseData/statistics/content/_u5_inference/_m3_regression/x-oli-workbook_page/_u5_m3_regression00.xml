	<!--<objref idref="objective1"/>-->

	<p>Welcome to the module on regression analysis. We're happy that you chose to study this important statistical topic using this module and hope that your learning experience will be an enriching and enjoyable one.</p>
	<p>The purpose of this introduction is to prepare you conceptually and technically for this module. In particular, the goals of this introduction are to give you a general idea of what regression analysis is, describe the structure of the entire module, and help you assess whether you are “ready” for this module in the sense of having the needed background knowledge in statistics.</p>
	<p>Let's begin. . .</p>
	
	<section>
		<title>Am I ready for this module?</title>
		<body>
			<p>Even though Regression Analysis is listed as the last goal, it might be a good idea to start by letting you know what statistical knowledge this module assumes, so that you can assess whether you are ready for it. In general, we assume that students had some introductory statistics course prior to going through this module. More specifically, this module assumes knowledge in:</p>
		<ul style="none">
			<li><em>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) </em>			
			<ul>
				<li>Graphical displays of data (such as histogram, boxplot and scatterplot). </li>
				<li>Numerical summaries of center and spread (such as the average, median, standard deviation, IQR, and the correlation coefficient r).</li>
				<li>The distinction between the explanatory (independent) variable and the response (dependent) variable.</li>
				<li>Association vs. causation.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><em>Sampling distributions</em>
			<ul>
				<li>The distinction between a parameter and a statistic. </li>
				<li>The idea of the sampling distribution of a statistic.</li>
				<li>The Central Limit Theorem.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><em>Statistical inference</em>
			<ul>
				<li>Point estimation</li>
				<li>Interval estimation (confidence intervals)</li>
				<li>Hypothesis testing (logic, formulation, P-value, drawing conclusions).</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul>
			<p>If you were exposed to these topics, but feel that you might be “rusty” on them, it might be a good idea to refresh your memory before learning this module using the previous materials in the OLI introductory statistics course, or any introductory statistics text. Another option is start going  through this module, see whether the explanations that are provided are enough for you, and if not, go back and refresh your memory.  </p>

		<title>What is Regression Analysis?</title>
		<body>
			<p>Generally speaking, regression analysis is a collection of data analysis methods used for exploring the relationship between variables. More specifically, regression analysis methods can be used for assessing whether there is an “important” (or “real”) relationship between variables, and if there is, the methods allow us to summarize this relationship, quantify it, assess its strength, and most importantly use all this information in practice.  </p>
			<p>The following two examples illustrate the type of data analysis situations where regression analysis will be helpful, and the type of questions that it will help us answer.</p>
		
		<example>
			<p>A statistics professor was interested in exploring the relationship between students’ <em>SAT Math Score (SAT-M) </em> and their <em> “Introductory Statistics” final score</em>. In particular, the professor wanted to study whether a student’s SAT-M score is a good predictor for how well he/she will perform in an introductory statistics course in college, and based his analysis on a random sample of 100 college students from his college.</p>
			<p>In this example we’re exploring the relationship between two variables:</p>
			<ul style="none">
				<li>The explanatory variable (X) – SAT-M</li>
				<li>The response variable (Y) – Introductory Statistics final score</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The professor plots the data using a scatterplot, and observed a clear positive pattern in the relationship between the two variables which also happens to be linear.</p>
			<image style="block" src="../webcontent/_u5_m3_img01.gif" alt=" "></image>
			<p>In this module we’ll learn how regression analysis helps us answer questions like the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Does the data allow us to generalize the observed relationship beyond this specific sample to the entire population of the students in the college?</li>
				<li>How can we quantify the relationship? For example, If student A scored 100 points more than Student B on the SAT-M, how much better can I expect student A’s performance in the statistics course to be?</li>
				<li>How can I use a student’s SAT-M score to predict his/her performance in a statistics course and how accurate, or trustworthy, is this prediction? In other words, if I predict a student’s score in a statistics course based on his/her SAT-M score, what can I expect my prediction error to be? 
				      <p>Or…</p>
				      <p> By how much can I expect to be “off” from what the student’s actual statistics score is going to be? </p></li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Just for the sake of discussion, let’s assume the following:</p>
			<p>The analysis of the data revealed that SAT-M is not a bad predictor, but also not a very accurate one. More specifically, the professor found that when SAT-M is used as a predictor for a student’s performance in “Intro Stats”, 95% of the time the prediction will be off by no more than 10 points. </p>
			<p>In other words, in most cases, there will be up to a 10 point difference between the “Intro Stats” score predicted by the SAT-M score of the student and the student’s actual “Intro Stats” score. As we said, this is “not bad” however, since a difference of 10 points usually translates into a difference in letter grade, the professor would like to improve the quality of the prediction.</p>
