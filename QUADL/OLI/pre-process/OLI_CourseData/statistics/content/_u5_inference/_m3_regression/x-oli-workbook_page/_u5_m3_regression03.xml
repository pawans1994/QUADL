	<p>As we explained in the introduction, multiple regression extends simple regression in that we have <em style = "italic">more than one</em> explanatory variable. We will use the letter <var>k</var> as a notation for the number of explanatory variables we’re considering. Our goal is to examine the relationship between the explanatory variables X1, X2, X3,….X<sub>k</sub> and the response Y, and the following figure gives and outline of the process:</p>
	<image style="block" src="../webcontent/_u5_m3_img09.gif" alt="Using a statistical model that relates Y to x1, x2, ....., xk, and based on the observed data, we draw conclusions about the relationship between these variables in the population"></image>
	<p><em>Comments on the figure:</em></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Note that since we have <var>k</var> explanatory variables, the dataset that we’re working with is much more complex than in simple regression where for each of the<var>n</var> subjects we had two observations; one X observation and one Y observation. Here, for each of the <var>n</var>  subjects we have <var>k+1</var> observations; one for each of the <var>k</var>  explanatory variables, and one for the response.</li>
		<li>As you remember from simple regression, and as the pink box emphasizes, the inference part of the analysis will be centered around a <em style = "italic"> statistical model</em> for the relationship between the explanatory variables and will be based on the observed data from out sample.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Here is how we’ll proceed from here</p>
	<ul>
		<li>First, we’ll be introduced to the example that will carry us through this section.</li>
		<li>We’ll then discuss the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) part of the analysis. </li>
		<li>We’ll do some simple regressions which we’ll need later for comparison with the multiple regression analysis</li>
		<li>Finally, we’ll introduce the multiple regression statistical model and conduct the analysis.</li>
	</ul>
