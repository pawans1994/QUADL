	<p>In this activity, we will continue working with the The <em style = "italic">National Assessment of Educational Progress</em> (NAEP) data from the previous Learn By Doing activity. Recall, that the data we’re considering are the average proficiency reading score reported for each of the 41 individual states that chose to participate in NAEP. <link href="../../webcontent/minitab/naep.mtw" target="new">Download the data set here.</link></p>

	<p>The variables in the data set are:</p>
	<table rowstyle="plain">
		<tr>
			<th>State</th>
			<td>There are 41 participating states.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>R.score</th>
			<td>This is the average state reading proficiency score.  It takes values between 0 -- 500.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>TV6</th>
			<td>proportion of students who watch 6 or more hours of TV a week.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Poor</th>
			<td>proportion of students living in disadvantaged urban areas.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Parents</th>
			<td>proportion of students whose parents went to college.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>And we are interested in explaining the variability in the response variable R.score using the explanatory variables, TV6, Poor and Parents.</p>
	<p>Recall that so far we conducted exploratory data analysis where we looked at the matrix plot and correlation matrix to get a feel for the relationship among our variables. In this activity we’ll go a step further and conduct the simple linear regression analyses of each of the three explanatory variables vs. the response.</p>
	<p>The following are instructions on how to do this in Minitab (which you’ll have to repeat three times, once for each explanatory variable):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Choose Stat &#x2192; Regression &#x2192; Regression.</li>
	<li>Enter the Response and one of the three Predictors.</li>
	<li>Click ok</li>
</ul>
