<question>
Since the margin of error is <m:math overflow="scroll">
<m:mrow>
<m:msup>
<m:mi>z</m:mi>
<m:mo>*</m:mo>
</m:msup>
<m:mo>⋅</m:mo>
<m:mfrac>
<m:mi mathvariant="normal">σ</m:mi>
<m:msqrt>
<m:mi>n</m:mi>
</m:msqrt>
</m:mfrac>
</m:mrow>
</m:math>, isn't it true that another way to reduce the margin of error (for a fixed z*) is to reduce σ?
</question>

<answer> While it is true that strictly mathematically speaking the smaller the value of σ, the
                smaller the margin of error, practically speaking we have absolutely no control over
                the value of σ (i.e., we cannot make it larger or smaller). σ is the population
                standard deviation; it is a fixed value (which here we assume is known)
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T145139-0500"?>that<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T145138-0500" content="which"?>
                has an effect on the width of the confidence interval (since it appears in the
                margin of error), but is definitely not a value we can play with. </answer>
