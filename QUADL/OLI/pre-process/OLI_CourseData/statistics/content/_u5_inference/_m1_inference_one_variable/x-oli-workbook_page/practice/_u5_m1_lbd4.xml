        <title>Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to learn how to use statistical software for calculating
            confidence intervals for μ when σ is unknown. In this case, using software is useful in
            the case when all you have is the raw data, <em>and</em> in the case when only summary
            statistics are provided (more specifically, the sample mean and the sample standard
            deviation s). The reason for using software in the latter case is, as mentioned before,
            the complexity of determining the appropriate t*.</p>
        <p>
            <em>Background:</em> As part of a large survey conducted at a large state university, a
            random sample of 142 students were asked: "How many hours do you sleep in a typical
            day?" The datafile linked below contains the data. Use these data to estimate μ, the
            mean number of hours college students at this university sleep in a typical day, with a
            95% confidence interval. </p>

                    <p>The data have been loaded into the data frame <code>sleep</code>. Enter the

                        is also called <code>sleep</code>. </p>
                    <p>Note that in this case we need to find a confidence interval for the
                        population mean when the population variance is unknown, and we will
                        therefore use the interval that we have just introduced (t-interval). R will
                        do this for us. Enter the command: </p>

                    <p>To change the confidence level, simply change the 0.95 in the code to the
                        appropriate level (in decimal form) and rerun the code. </p>

                        </m:math> for the confidence interval. Before we can do this, we first have
                        to calculate the values for each of the variables in the equation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To calculate the critical value t*, we use the Excel function
                                <em>T.INV.2T(probability, degrees of freedom)</em>. In this case, we
                            would type <code style="inline">=T.INV.2T(0.05, 141)</code>.</li>
                        <li>To calculate the sample mean, use the <em>AVERAGE</em> function. In this
                            case, we would type <code style="inline">=AVERAGE(A2:A143)</code>.</li>
                        <li>To calculate the sample standard deviation, use the <em>STDEV
                                function</em>. In this case, we would type <code style="inline"
                                >=STDEV.S(A2:A143)</code>.</li>
                        <li>To calculate the standard error, we'll divide the sample standard
                            deviation that we just calculated by the square root of n.</li>
                        <li>Finally, we calculate the margin of error by multiplying the critical t*
                            value by the standard error.</li>
                        <li><em>IMPORTANT:</em> There is a shortcut alternative that is similar to
                            calculating the margin of error when the population standard deviation
                            (sigma) is known.</li>
                        <li>To calculate the margin of error using the shortcut, we use the Excel
                            function <em>CONFIDENCE.T(a,s,n)</em>, where a is the alpha value, s is the
                            population standard deviation, and n is the sample size. Note that the
                            alpha value a = 1 - C, where C is the confidence level (in our case,
                            0.95). In this case, we enter the formula as follows:
                            <code style="inline">=CONFIDENCE.T(0.05, 1.5985, 142)</code></li>

                        <li>Finally, we calculate the margin of error by multiplying the critical t*
