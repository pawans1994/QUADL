  <question id="q1">
    <body>Read the two versions carefully. In particular, pay attention to the highlighted parts.
      The <em>main</em> difference between the two versions is that: </body>
    <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
      <choice value="A">in example 2** we are told that the dean of students initiated the study,
        and in example 2* we don't know who did.</choice>
      <choice value="B">in example 2* the alternative is the one-sided H<sub>0</sub>: p &gt;
        0.157, and the new wording of example 2** suggests that the "other" one-sided alternative
          H<sub>o</sub>: p &lt; 0.157 is appropriate.</choice>
      <choice value="C">in example 2* the alternative is two-sided, and the new wording in example
        2** suggests that a one-sided alternative is appropriate.</choice>
      <choice value="D">in example 2* the alternative is one-sided (H<sub>0</sub>: p &gt; 0.157),
        and the new wording in example 2** suggests that the two-sided alternative is
        appropriate.</choice>
    </multiple_choice>
    <part>
      <response match="A">
        <feedback>Incorrect. Yes, this is a difference, but definitely not the main
          difference. Ask for a hint and try again.</feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="B">
        <feedback>Incorrect. You are right that the change in wording in example 2** affected which
          alternative hypothesis is appropriate; however, it is not true that in example 2** the
          one-sided alternative H<sub>0</sub>: p &lt; 0.157 is appropriate.</feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="C">
        <feedback>Incorrect. You are right that the change in wording in example 2** affected which
          alternative hypothesis is appropriate; however, in the answer you chose both the
          alternatives for example 2* and the alternative for example 2** are wrong. You almost got
          it rightâ€”read the examples again carefully and try again.</feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="D" score="10">
        <feedback>Correct. Read on for the explanation.</feedback>
      </response>
      <hint>How did the change in wording in example 2** affect what alternative hypothesis is being
        tested against H<sub>0</sub>? (The key words are bold.) </hint>
