        during their pregnancies<?oxy_insert_end?>. In particular, the researchers wanted to study
        the effect that smoking has on the pregnancy length. A sample 114 pregnant women who were
        smokers participated in the study and were followed until the birth of their child. At the
        end of the study, the collected data were analyzed and it was found that the average
        pregnancy length of the 114 women was 260 days.
        From<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T151333-0500"?>
        a<?oxy_insert_end?> large body of research, it is known that
        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T151344-0500"?>the
        <?oxy_insert_end?>length of human pregnancy has a standard deviation of 16 days.</p>
      <p>In the previous activity, we calculated a 95% confidence interval for Î¼, the mean pregnancy
        length of women who smoke during their pregnancy based on the given information, and found
        it to be 260 +/-
        3<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T151400-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?> or
        (257, 263).</p>
      <p>Assume now that the researcher wants to get a more precise interval
        estimation<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T151414-0500" content=","?> by
        reducing the margin of error from 3 to 2 while maintaining the same level of confidence. How
        many additional smoking pregnant women should the researcher sample? (Hint: calculate first
        what the total sample size must be in order to achieve this).</p></body>

        <p>We'll first calculate what the (total) sample size must be in order to get a 95%
          confidence interval with a margin of error of 2. Using the formula we've
          developed, we get:</p>

        <p>Since the researcher has already collected data from 114 women,
          <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T151505-0500"?>the
          researcher<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T151504-0500" content="he"?>
          needs to sample 256 - 114 = 142 additional women.</p>
