            <p>Suppose the results indicate that the null hypothesis should not be rejected; thus,
                it is possible that a type II error has been committed.</p>
            <p>Given the type of error made in this situation, what could researchers do to reduce
                the risk of this error?</p>

            <choice value="A">Choose a 0.01 significance level instead of a 0.05 significance

            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Choosing a smaller significance level will decrease the chance
                    of a type I error because it will make it more difficult to reject the null
                    hypothesis. However, this is a type I error.</feedback>

            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. Increasing the sample size is the best way to reduce the

            <p>A researcher wants to avoid making a type II error. Which of the following actions
                would be the most effective in reducing the risk of a type II error?</p>

        <input shuffle="true">

            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. If she chooses an alpha level of 0.05, she has a 5% chance of
                    making a type I error. If she chooses a lower alpha level, it will lower her
                    chance of making a type I error. However, the question focuses on lowering the
                    chances of a type II error, not a type I error.</feedback>

                    significance level, it would decrease the chance of making a type I error from
                    5% to 1%. However, question focuses on lowering the chances of a type II error,
