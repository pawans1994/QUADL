<title>4. Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals</title>
<body>
<p>The last topic we want to discuss is the relationship between hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Even though the flavor of these two forms of inference is different (confidence intervals estimate a parameter, and hypothesis testing assesses the evidence in the data against one claim and in favor of another), there is a strong link between them.</p>
<p>We will explain this link (using the z-test and confidence interval for the population proportion), and then explain how confidence intervals can be used after a test has been carried out.</p>
<p>Recall that a confidence interval gives us a set of plausible values for the unknown population parameter. We may therefore examine a confidence interval to informally decide if a proposed value of population proportion seems plausible. </p>
<p>For example, if a 95% confidence interval for p, the proportion of all U.S. adults already
                    familiar with Viagra in May 1998, was (.61, .67), then it seems clear that we
                    should be able to reject a claim that only 50% of all U.S. adults were familiar
                    with the
                    drug<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T163943-0500" content="."?>,
                    since based on the confidence interval, .50 is not one of the plausible values
                    for p.</p>
<p>In fact, the information provided by a confidence interval can be formally related to the
                    information provided by a hypothesis test. (<em>Comment:</em> The relationship
                    is more straightforward for two-sided alternatives, and so we will not present
                    results for the one-sided
                    case<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T164010-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>.)</p>
<p>Suppose we want to carry out the <em>two-sided
                        <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T164042-0500" comment="use subscript for Ha in equation below"?>test:<?oxy_comment_end?></em>
                </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image299.gif" alt="H_0: p = p_0     and     H_a: p &ne; p_0"/>
<p>using a significance level of .05.</p>
<p>An alternative way to perform this test is to find a 95% <em>confidence interval</em> for p and check:</p>

<p>(<em>Comment:</em> Similarly, the results of a test using a significance level of .01 can be related to the 99% confidence interval.)</p>
<p>Let's look at two examples:</p>
<example>

<p>Recall example 3, where we wanted to know whether the proportion of U.S. adults who support the death penalty for convicted murderers has changed since 2003, when it was .64.</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image223.gif" alt="A large circle represents

find that 675 are in favor. p-hat =675/1000 = .675."/>
<p>We are

<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image300.gif" alt="H_0: p = .64      and       H_a: p &ne; .64;"/>
<p>and as the figure reminds us, we took a sample of
                        1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T164325-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>000
                        U.S. adults, and the data told us that 675 supported the death penalty for
                        convicted murderers (i.e. <m:math overflow="scroll">

<p>Since the 95% confidence interval for p does not include .64 as a plausible value for p, we can
                        reject

                        support the death penalty for convicted murderers has changed since
                        2003.</p>

<p>You and your roommate are arguing about whose turn it is to clean the apartment. Your roommate
                        suggests that you settle this by tossing a coin and takes one out of a
                        locked box he has on the shelf. Suspecting that the coin might not be fair,
                        you decide to test it first. You toss the coin 80 times, thinking to

            <p>The UCLA Internet Report (February 2003) estimated that roughly 60.5% of U.S. adults
                            use the
                            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T164959-0500"?>I<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T164958-0500" content="i"?>nternet
                            at work for personal use. A follow-up study was conducted in order to
                            explore whether that figure has changed since. Let p be the proportion
                            of U.S. adults who use the
                            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T165015-0500"?>I<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T165014-0500" content="i"?>nternet

<p>The context of the last example is a good opportunity to bring up an important point that was discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Even though we use .05 as a cutoff to guide our decision about whether the results are
                    significant, we should not treat it as
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T171822-0500"?>inviolable<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T171820-0500" content="sacred"?>
                    and we should always add our own judgment. Let's look at the last example
                    again.</p>
<p>It turns out that the p-value of this test is .0734. In other words, it is maybe not extremely
                    unlikely, but it is quite unlikely (probability of .0734) that when you toss a
                        <em>fair</em> coin 80 times you'll get a sample proportion of heads of 48/80<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T171846-0500"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>=<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T171846-0500"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>.6 (or even more extreme). It is true that using the .05
                    significance level (cutoff), .0734 is not considered small enough to conclude
                    that the coin is not fair. However, if you really don't want to clean the
                    apartment, the p-value might be small enough for you to ask your roommate to use
                    a different coin, or to provide one yourself!</p>
