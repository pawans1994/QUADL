            <body><p>In May 2015, two opinion polls were conducted regarding same-sex marriage. In
                    particular, both polls were conducted in order to estimate <em style="italic"
                        >p</em>, the proportion of all U.S. adults who believe that same-sex
                    marriage should be legal.</p>
                <p>• The Gallup poll was based on a random sample of 1,024 U.S. adults and estimated
                    the proportion of all U.S. adults who support gay marriage to be 0.60.</p>
                <p>• The Pew Research Center poll was based on a random sample of 2,002 U.S. adults
                    and estimated the proportion of all U.S. adults who support gay marriage to be
                    0.57.</p>
                <p>Which of the two polls estimates <em style="italic">p</em> (the proportion of all
                    U.S. adults who support gay marriage) more accurately? That is, which of the two
                    point estimates (0.57 or 0.60) is more likely to be closer to the actual value
                    of <em style="italic">p</em>?</p>

                <choice value="C">Both polls estimate <em style="italic">p</em> with the same
                    accuracy because both are based on a random sample.</choice>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that the larger the sample the point estimate is
                        based on, the closer it is likely to be to the parameter it
                        estimates.</feedback>

                <response match="B" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. The larger the sample the point estimate is based on, the
                        closer it is likely to be to the parameter it estimates.</feedback>

                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Both polls estimate p with the same accuracy since both are
                        based on a random sample Incorrect. The fact that both estimates were
                        obtained from a random sample ensures that both are unbiased, but does not
                        affect their accuracy. Recall that the larger the sample that the point
                        estimate is based on, the more likely it is to be closer to the parameter it
                        estimates. </feedback>
