        <title>Visualizing the Relationship between Confidence and Width</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to use computer simulation to visually explore and
            reinforce the relationship between confidence and width, for confidence intervals. We
            <!--will use a Java applet-->use an HTML activity to explore this concept.</p>

        <p>As you will remember from a previous activity, the applet shows a normal-shaped
            distribution, which represents the <em>sampling distribution of the mean</em> (<m:math
                overflow="scroll">

                </m:mrow>
            </m:math>) for random samples of a particular fixed sample size, from a population with
            a fixed standard deviation (&sigma;). The green line marks the value of the population
            mean (&mu;). </p>
        <!--<p> To begin the simulation, click the very top <em>Sample 50</em> button at the right of
            the applet. You have used the simulation to select 50 samples from the population; the
            applet has automatically computed the sample means and the corresponding confidence
            intervals.</p>
        <p>Notice, along the left of the applet, that you can change the confidence level. Do this,
            and watch what happens to the intervals as the confidence is changed among all the
            levels available.</p>-->
        <p>To begin the simulation, make sure that the confidence level (on the very top) is set to 80%, and right below, click about 5 times on the <em style="bold">Sample</em> button. You have used the simulation to select 5 samples from the population; the applet has automatically computed the sample means (indicated by the <!--red -->dot in the center of intervals) and the corresponding 80% confidence intervals.</p>
        <p>Now, change the confidence level to 90% and click on the <em style="bold">Sample</em> button 5 more times
            to simulate five 90% confidence intervals. Notice the change in the width of the confidence intervals compared to the 80% confidence intervals.</p>
        <p>Now, change the confidence level to 95% and click on the <em style="bold">Sample</em> button 5 more times
            to simulate five 95% confidence intervals. Notice the change in the width of the confidence intervals compared to the 90% confidence intervals.</p>
        <p>Finally, change the confidence level to 99% and click on the <em style="bold">Sample</em> button 5 more times
            to simulate five 99% confidence intervals. Notice the change in the width of the confidence intervals compared to the 95% confidence intervals.</p>

        <!--<wb:inline idref="u4_m1_confintmean3_lbd_tutor2" purpose="learnbydoing"/>-->
        <p>To continue the simulation, click on <em style="bold">Reset</em> and change the confidence level back to 80%.
            Click on the <em style="bold">Sample 50</em> button. You have used the simulation to simulate 50 samples from the population; the applet has automatically computed the sample means (indicated by the <!--red -->dot in the center of intervals) and the corresponding 80% confidence intervals.</p> 
        <p>Note that under the <em style="bold">Reset</em> button, you are told how many hits you have out of the 50 intervals. Recall from the applet activity on the previous page that <em style="italic">hits</em> means how many out of the 50 confidence intervals covered the unknown mean.</p> 
        <p>Click on <em style="bold">Sample 50</em> again for a total of 100 confidence intervals.</p> 
        <p>What percentage of the 100 confidence intervals covered? Write down this percentage in the textbox below.</p> 
        <p>Note that since we simulated 100 80% confidence intervals, the percentage of hits should be close to 80%.</p>
        <p>Now change the confidence level to 90%, simulate 100 confidence intervals, and write the percentage of confidence intervals that cover in the textbox below.</p>
        <p>Repeat for the 95% and 99% confidence levels.</p>
