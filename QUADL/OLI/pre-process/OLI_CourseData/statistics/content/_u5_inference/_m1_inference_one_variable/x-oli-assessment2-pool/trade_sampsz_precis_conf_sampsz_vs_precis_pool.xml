            <p>A study was conducted to estimate μ, the mean number of weekly hours that U.S.
                adults use computers at home. Suppose a random sample of 81 U.S. adults gives a mean
                weekly computer usage time of 8.5 hours and that from prior studies, the population
                standard deviation is assumed to be σ = 3.6 hours.</p>
            <p>How large a sample of U.S. adults is needed in order to estimate μ with a 95%
                confidence interval of <em style="bold">length</em> 1.2 hours?</p>
