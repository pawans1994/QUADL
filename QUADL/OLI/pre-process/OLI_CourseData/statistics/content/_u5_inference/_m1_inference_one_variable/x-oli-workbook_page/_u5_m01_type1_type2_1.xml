			<title>What Can Go Wrong: Two Types of Errors</title>
			<body>
				<p>Statistical investigations involve making decisions in the face of uncertainty.
					So there is always some chance of making a wrong decision. In hypothesis
					testing, the following decisions can occur:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If the null hypothesis is true and we do not reject it, it is a <em
							style="bold">correct decision.</em></li>
					<li>If the null hypothesis is false and we reject it, it is a <em style="bold"
							>correct decision.</em></li>
					<li>If the null hypothesis is true, but we reject it. This is a <em style="bold"
							>type I </em>error.</li>
					<li>If the null hypothesis is false, but we fail to reject it. This is a <em
							style="bold">type II </em>error.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Type I and type II errors are not caused by mistakes. They are the result of
					random chance. The <em style="bold">data </em>provide evidence for a conclusion
					that is false. It’s no one’s fault!</p>

			<title>A Courtroom Analogy for Hypothesis Tests</title>

			<p>Defendants standing trial for a crime are considered innocent until evidence shows
				they are guilty. It is the job of the prosecution to present evidence that shows the
				defendant is guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.” It is the job of the defense to
				challenge this evidence and establish a reasonable doubt. The jury weighs the
				evidence and makes a decision.</p>
			<p>When a jury makes a decision, only two verdicts are possible:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em style="bold">Guilty: </em>The jury concludes that there is enough evidence
					to convict the defendant. The evidence is so strong that there is not a
					reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt.</li>
				<li><em style="bold">Not guilty: </em>The jury concludes that there is not enough
					evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Notice that a verdict of “not guilty” is not a conclusion that the defendant is
				innocent. This verdict says only that there is not enough evidence to return a
				guilty verdict.</p>
			<p><em style="italic">How is this like a hypothesis test?</em></p>
			<p>The null hypothesis, <em style="italic">H</em><em style="italic"><sub>0</sub></em>,
				in American courtrooms is “the defendant is innocent.” The alternative hypothesis,
					<em style="italic">H</em><em style="italic"><sub>a</sub></em>, is “the defendant
				is guilty.” The evidence presented in the case is the data on which the verdict is
				based. In a courtroom, the defendant is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty.
				In a hypothesis test, we assume the null hypothesis is true until the dataindicates
				otherwise.</p>
			<p>The two possible verdicts are similar to the two conclusions that are possible in a
				hypothesis test.</p>
			<p><em style="bold">Reject the null hypothesis: </em>When we reject a null hypothesis,
				we accept the alternative hypothesis. This is equivalent to a guilty verdict in the
				courtroom. The evidence is strong enough for the jury to reject the initial
				assumption of innocence. In a hypothesis test, the data is strong enough for us to
				reject the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.</p>
			<p><em style="bold">Fail to reject the null hypothesis: </em>When we fail to reject the
				null hypothesis, we are delivering a “not guilty” verdict. The jury concludes that
				the evidence is not strong enough to reject the assumption of innocence. So the data
				is too weak to support a guilty verdict. We conclude the data is not strong enough
				to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, the data is too weak to accept the
				alternative hypothesis.</p>
			<p><em style="italic">How does the courtroom analogy relate to Type I and Type II
					errors?</em></p>
			<p><em style="bold">Type I error: </em>The evidence leads the jury to convict an
				innocent person. By analogy, we reject a true null hypothesis and accept a false
				alternative hypothesis.</p>
			<p><em style="bold">Type II error: </em>The evidence leads the jury to declare a
				defendant not guilty, when he is in fact guilty. By analogy, we fail to reject a
				null hypothesis that is false. In other words, we do not accept an alternative
				hypothesis when it is really true.</p>
			<p>It would be nice to know when each of these errors is happening when we make our
				decision about the null hypothesis, but statistical decisions are based on evidence
				gathered through sampling, and our sampling evidence will sometimes fool us. As long
				as we are making a decision, we will never be able to eliminate the potential for
				these two types of errors. Thus, we need to learn how to adjust to the consequences
				of making these types of errors.</p>

			<title>What is the probability that we will make a Type I error?</title>
			<body>
				<p>If the significance level is 5 percent (α = .05), then 5 percent of the time, we
					will reject the null hypothesis, even if it is true. Of course we will not know
					whether the null hypothesis is true. But if it is, the natural variability that
					we expect in random samples will produce “rare” results 5 percent of the
					time.</p>
				<p>This makes sense, because when we create the sampling distribution, we assume the
					null hypothesis is true. We look at the variability in random samples selected
					from the population described by the null hypothesis.</p>
				<p>Similarly, if the significance level is 1 percent, then we can expect the sample
					results to lead us to reject the null hypothesis 1 percent of the time. In other
					words, about one in 100 data sets would show “rare” results that contrast with
					the other 99 data sets, leading us to reject the null hypothesis. If the null
					hypothesis is actually true, then by chance alone, we will reject a true null
					hypothesis 1 percent of the time. So the probability of a type I error in this
					case is 1 percent.</p>
				<p>In general, the probability of a type I error is α.</p>


			</body>

		<section>
			<title>What is the probability that we will make a Type II error?</title>
			<body>
				<p>As you have just seen, the probability of a type I error is equal to the
					significance level, α. The probability of a type II error is much more
					complicated to calculate, but it is inversely related to the probability of
					making a type I error. Thus, reducing the chance of making a type II error
					causes an increase in the likelihood of a type I error.</p>

		<section>
			<title>Decreasing the Chance of Type I or Type II Error</title>
			<body>
				<p>How can we decrease the chance of a type I or type II error? Well, decreasing the
					chance of a type I error increases the chance of a type II error, so we must
					weigh the consequences of these errors before deciding how to proceed.</p>
				<p>Recall that the probability of committing a type I error is α. Why is this? Well,
					when we choose a level of significance (α), we are choosing a benchmark for
					rejecting the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is true, then the
					probability that we will reject a true null hypothesis is α.
					So the smaller α is, the smaller the probability of a type I error there
					will be.</p>
				<p>It is more complicated to calculate the probability of a type II error. The best
					way to reduce the probability of a type II error is to increase the sample size.
					But once the sample size is set, larger values of α will decrease the
					probability of a type II error while increasing the probability of a type I
					error.</p>
