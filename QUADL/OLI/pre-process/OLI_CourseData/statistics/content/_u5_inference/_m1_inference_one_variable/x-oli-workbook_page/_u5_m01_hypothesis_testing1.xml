        <p>We are in the middle of the part of the course that has to do with inference for one variable.</p>
        <p>So far, we talked about point estimation and learned how interval estimation enhances it
            by quantifying the magnitude of the estimation error (with a certain level of
            confidence) in the form of the margin of error. The result is the confidence
            interval<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T124042-0500"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T124039-0500" content=" - "?>an

            we believe captures the unknown parameter.</p>
        <p>We are now moving to the other kind of inference, <em>hypothesis testing</em>. We say
            that hypothesis testing is "the other kind" because, unlike the inferential methods we
            presented so
            far<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T124104-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            where the goal was <em>estimating</em> the unknown parameter, the idea, logic and goal
            of hypothesis testing

            quite different.</p>
        <p>In the first part of this module we will discuss the idea behind hypothesis testing,
            explain how it works, and introduce
            <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T124143-0500" content="the "?>new
            terminology that emerges in this form of inference. The next two parts will be more
            specific and will discuss hypothesis testing for the population proportion

            and for the population mean
