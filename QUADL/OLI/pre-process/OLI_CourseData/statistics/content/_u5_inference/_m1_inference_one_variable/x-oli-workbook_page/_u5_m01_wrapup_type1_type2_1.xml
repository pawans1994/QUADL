		<title>Wrap up Type I and Type II Errors</title>
	</head>

	<body>

		<p>It is important to remember to take into consideration the possibility of the occurrence
			of Type I or Type II error, when drawing conclusions from hypothesis tests. Thus:</p>

		<ul>
			<li> Whenever there is a failure to reject the null hypothesis, it is possible that a
				Type II error has occurred. Thus, it is concluded from the results of the study,
				that there are no significant differences, even though, in reality, there are
				significant differences.</li>
			<li> Whenever the null hypothesis is rejected, it is possible that a Type I error has
				been committed. That is, it is concluded from the results of the study, that there
				are significant differences, when, in reality, there are no differences.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However, it is not possible to know when either Type I or Type II error has occurred.</p>

		<image src="../webcontent/type_i_ii_errors.png" alt="A table describing when errors occur.
When H_0 is true, and we reject H_0, we have made a Type I error. If we fail to reject H_0, this is the
correct decision. When H_0 is false (H_a is true), and we reject H_0, we have made the correct decision.
If we fail to reject H_0, this is a type II error."/>
