            <p>Suppose the results indicate that the null hypothesis should be rejected; thus, it is
                possible that a type I error has been committed.</p>
            <p>Given the type of error made in this situation, what could researchers do to reduce
                the risk of this error?</p>

            <p>A researcher wants to avoid making a type I error. Which of the following actions
