            <p>Dr. Gray would like to do a survey on whether the proportion of people ages 18 to 22
                who have seen a healthcare professional (doctor, nurse, hospital, etc.) in the past
                year is higher than the national average of 82%. She plans to give her survey to 80
                student athletes at your college by distributing surveys after sports practice. Is
                this survey valid or not valid for testing the hypothesis that the proportion of
                people ages 18 to 22 who have seen a healthcare professional in the past year is
                higher than the national average?</p>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Student athletes probably see health care professionals more
                    than average because of the need for physical exams related to sports. This is
                    also not a random sample of people ages 18 to 22.</feedback>

            <p>The proportion of college football players who have had at least one concussion is
                estimated to be 34% in the United States. We wanted to know if football players at
                our university were less likely to have suffered a concussion, so we surveyed a
                random sample of 100 past and present football players at our university. Is this
                survey valid or not valid for testing the hypothesis that the proportion of college
                football players at our university with at least one concussion is less than the
                national average?</p>
