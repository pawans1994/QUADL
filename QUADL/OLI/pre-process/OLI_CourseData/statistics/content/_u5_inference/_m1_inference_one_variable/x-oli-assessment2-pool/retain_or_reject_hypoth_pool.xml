            <p>Suppose that a major polling organization wanted to test the hypothesis that there
                was a change in the president’s “approval rating” since last month. Last month, 35%
                of the representative sample of registered voters approved of the president. For
                this month, the null hypothesis was that the approval rating equals 35% and the
                alternative hypothesis is that the approval rating does not equal 35%. The
                significance level for this test was 0.05.</p>
            <p>The results of the hypothesis test of the new survey showed a p-value of 0.008.</p>
            <p>Which of the following statements is correct? Check all that apply.</p>

            <p>For this survey, the null hypothesis was that the proportion of students with
                graduated with student loan debt equals 69% and the alternative hypothesis is that
                the proportion with student loan debt does not equal 69%. The significance level for
                this test was 0.05.</p>

                <feedback>Incorrect. You are correct that the results were statistically significant
                    because the p-value of 0.039 was less than the significance level of 0.05. Also,
                    you are correct that the null hypothesis should be rejected because the p-value
                    of 0.039 was less than the significance level of 0.05. However, we never
                    “accept” the null hypothesis. Additionally, if the p-value is greater than 0.05,
                    we say that we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In
                    this case the p-value was less than 0.05.</feedback>
