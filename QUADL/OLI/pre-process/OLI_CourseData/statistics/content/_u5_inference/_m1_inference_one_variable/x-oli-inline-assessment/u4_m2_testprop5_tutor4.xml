                <choice value="B">It is not safe to use the z-test for p, since the sample is not a
                    random sample from the entire population (or cannot be considered as
                    one).</choice>
                <choice value="C">It is not safe to use the z-test for p since n * p<sub>o</sub> is
                    not large enough.</choice>

                    <feedback>Correct. Indeed n * p<sub>o</sub> = 100 * 0.087 = 8.7 is not large
                        enough since it is less than 10.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. n * (1 - p<sub>o</sub>) = 100 * (1 - 0.087) = 91.3 &#8805; 10 as required. </feedback>
