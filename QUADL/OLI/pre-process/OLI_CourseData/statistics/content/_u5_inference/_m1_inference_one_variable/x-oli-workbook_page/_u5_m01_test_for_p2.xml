        <p>Recall that there are basically 4 steps in the process of hypothesis testing:</p>
        <p>1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.</p>
        <p>2. Collect relevant data from a random sample and summarize them
            (<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T202838-0500"?>using<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T202837-0500" content="by"?>

        <p>3. Find the p-value, the probability of observing data like
            th<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T202848-0500"?>ose<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T202847-0500" content="at"?>
            observed assuming that H<sub>o</sub> is true.</p>
        <p>4. Based on the p-value, decide whether we have enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>
            (and accept H<sub>a</sub>), and draw our conclusions in context.</p>
        <p>We are now going to go through these steps as they apply to the hypothesis testing for
            the population proportion p. It should be noted that even though the details will be
            specific to this particular test, some of the ideas that we will add apply to hypothesis
            testing in general.</p>

                <p>H<sub>o</sub>: p = some value</p>

                <p>Note that it was quite clear from the context which form of the alternative

                    The value that is specified in the null hypothesis is called the <em>null
                        value</em>, and is generally denoted by p<sub>o</sub>. We can say,
                    therefore, that in general the null hypothesis about the population proportion
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T203238-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>p<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T203239-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    would take the form:</p>
                <p>H<sub>o</sub>: p = p<sub>o</sub>
                </p>
                <p>We write H<sub>o</sub>: p = p<sub>o</sub> to say that we are making the
                    hypothesis that the population proportion has the value of p<sub>o</sub>. In
                    other words, p is the unknown population proportion and p<sub>o</sub> is the
                    number we think p might be for the given situation.</p>
                <p>The alternative hypothesis takes one of the following three forms (depending on

                <p>Example 3 (death penalty) is a case where we have a two-sided alternative:</p>

                <p>In this case, in order to reject H<sub>o</sub> and accept H<sub>a</sub> we will
