          which means that at the .05 level H<sub>o</sub> cannot be rejected. However, the p-value
          is

          which at the .05 level indicates that H<sub>o</sub> can be rejected. For this to be a
          correct output, the p-value should be greater than .05 so that the conclusion agrees with
          the conclusion we make using the confidence interval. </feedback>

        <feedback><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T225134-0500"?>Correct.
          <?oxy_insert_end?>We are testing H<sub>o</sub>: &#956; = 266
          vs<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T225144-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?>
            H<sub>a</sub>: &#956; &#8800; 266. The 95% confidence interval does not cover the null
          value,
          266<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T225154-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
          which means that at the .05 level H<sub>o</sub> can be rejected. This is also confirmed by
          the p-value being
          0.027<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T225237-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
          which at the .05 level indicates that H<sub>o</sub> can be rejected. This is the correct
          answer, because this is the only output out of the three where the conclusion we make
          using the confidence interval and the conclusion we make using the p-value agree. </feedback>
