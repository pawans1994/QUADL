        <example>

            <p>The drug Viagra became available in the U.S. in May, 1998, in the wake of an
                advertising campaign that was unprecedented in scope and intensity. A Gallup poll
                found that by the end of the first week in May, 643 out of a random sample of 1,005
                adults were aware that Viagra was an impotency medication (based on "Viagra A
                Popular Hit," a Gallup poll analysis by Lydia Saad, May 1998).</p>
            <p>Let's estimate the proportion p of all adults in the U.S. who by the end of the first
                week of May 1998 were already aware of Viagra and its purpose by setting up a 95%
                confidence interval for p.</p>
            <p>We first need to calculate the sample proportion <m:math overflow="scroll">

            <p>We can be 95% sure that the proportion of all U.S. adults who were already familiar
                with Viagra by that time was between .61 and .67 (or 61% and 67%).</p>
            <p>The fact that the margin of error equals .03 says we can be 95% confident that
                unknown population proportion p is within .03 (3%) of the observed sample proportion
                .64 (64%). In other words, we are 95% confident that 64% is "off" by no more than
                3%.</p>

            <body>
                <p>We would like to share with you the methodology part of the poll release of the
                    Viagra example, and show you that you now have the tools to understand how polls
                    results are analyzed:</p>
                <p>"The results are based on telephone interviews with a randomly selected national
                    sample of 1,005 adults, 18 years and older, conducted May 8-10, 1998. For
                    results based on samples of this size, one can say with 95 percent confidence
                    that the error attributable to sampling and other random effects could be plus
                    or minus 3 percentage points. In addition to sampling error, question wording
                    and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias
                    into the findings of public opinion polls."</p>
                <!--<activity idref="_u5_m1_lbd5" purpose="learnbydoing"/>-->
                <p>The purpose of the next activity is to provide guided practice in calculating and
                    interpreting the confidence interval for the population proportion p, and
                    drawing conclusions from it.</p>

                        <p>A poll asked a random sample of 1,000 U.S. adults, "Do you think that the
                            use of marijuana should be legalized?" 560 of those asked answered
                            yes.</p>

                </section>
                <p>Two important results that we discussed at length when we talked about the
                    confidence interval for μ also apply here:</p>
                <p>1. There is a trade-off between level of confidence and the width (or precision)
                    of the confidence interval. The more precision you would like the confidence
                    interval for p to have, the more you have to pay by having a lower level of
                    confidence.</p>
                <p>2. Since n appears in the denominator of the margin of error of the confidence
                    interval for p, for a fixed level of confidence, the larger the sample, the
                    narrower, or more precise it is. This brings us naturally to our next point.</p>
