                    <feedback>Incorrect. This statement is really saying that the p-value
                        is the probability that H<sub>a</sub> is true. H<sub>a</sub> is either true
                        or it isn't. We cannot make a probability statement about it because there
                        is no randomness involved. We can only make probability statements about
                        random events, such as results from random samples. The p-value is the
                        probability that a random sample will have results greater than (or less
                        than) an observed result if H<sub>0</sub> is true.</feedback>
