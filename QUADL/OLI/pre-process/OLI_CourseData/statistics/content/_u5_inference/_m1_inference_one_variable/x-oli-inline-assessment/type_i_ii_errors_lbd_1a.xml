                <feedback>Correct. In a type I error, we reject a null hypothesis that is true.
                    Here, the researchers conclude that the larger proportion of breast cancer and
                    heart disease was statistically significant; therefore, they have rejected the
                    null hypothesis of “no difference.”</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. In a type II error, we fail to reject a null hypothesis that is
                    false. We cannot make a type II error by rejecting the null hypothesis. Here,
                    the researchers conclude that the larger proportion of breast cancer and heart
                    disease is statistically significant; therefore, they have rejected the null
                    hypothesis of “no difference.” Please try again.</feedback>

            <response input="B" name="impossible_to_tell" match="three" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Each type of error relates to a specific conclusion from the
                    hypothesis test. We have to reject the null hypothesis to make a type I error.
                    We have to fail to reject the null hypothesis to make a type II error. What
                    conclusion did the researchers make? Based on this conclusion, please try
                    again.</feedback>

            <hint>Remember, you are trying to determine what type of error—type I or type II—the
                researchers could have made based on the data.</hint>

            <hint>A type I error is possible only if we reject the <em style="bold"
