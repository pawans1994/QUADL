                    <feedback>Correct. We rejected the null hypothesis. With a type I error, we
                        reject a null hypothesis that is true.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect: With a type II error, we fail to reject a null hypothesis
                        that is false. In this hypothesis test, we reject the null; therefore, it is
                        impossible to have a type II error.</feedback>

                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect: One of the two types of errors is always a possibility. In
                        a hypothesis test, there are two possible conclusions, and each conclusion
                        comes with the possibility of one of these errors.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="D" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect: It is never possible to make both of these errors at the
                        same time. In a hypothesis test, there are two possible conclusions, and
                        each conclusion comes with the possibility of one of these
                        errors.</feedback>

                <hint>Remember, you are trying to determine what type of error (type I or type II)
                    the researchers may have made in making their conclusions.</hint>
                <hint> &gt;A type I error is possible only if we reject the <em style="bold">H</em>
