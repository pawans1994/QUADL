    <question id="q1">
        <body>We know that the "lower tail probability" of less than a score of −2 under the normal
            distribution, P(Z &lt; −2), is approximately 0.025 (from the 95% part of the
            approximation rule for normal distributions). Which of the following will be the lower
            tail probability of less than a score of −2 under the t distribution pictured
            above?</body>
        <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
            <choice value="A">Smaller than 0.025</choice>
            <choice value="B">0.025, same as for Z</choice>
            <choice value="C">Larger than 0.025</choice>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Note that the t distribution is more spread out than the Z
                    distribution and, therefore, values that are further away from the mean (0) are
                    more likely on the t distribution. In particular, getting values of less than a
                    score of −2 is more likely with the t distribution than with the Z distribution.
                    Visually, this is because the t distribution has "fatter tails" and, thus, there
                    is more area to the left of −2 under the t distribution than under the Z
                    distribution.</feedback>

                <feedback>Correct. Indeed, the t distribution is more spread out than the Z
                    distribution and, therefore, values that are further away from the mean (0) are
                    more likely on the t distribution. In particular, getting values of less than a

    <question id="q2">
        <body>We know from the standard deviation rule that there is approximately a 68% chance that
            any normal random variable will get values within one standard deviation of the mean. In
            particular, P(−1 &lt; Z &lt; 1) = 0.68. Which of the following is true regarding the
            probability of getting values between −1 and 1 under the t distribution?</body>
        <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
            <choice value="A">The probability is less than 0.68.</choice>
            <choice value="B">The probability is more than 0.68.</choice>
            <choice value="C">The probability is 0.68, the same as it is for Z.</choice>

        <part>
            <response match="A" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. The t distribution is more spread out than the Z distribution and
                    therefore the tail probabilities above 1 and below −1 are larger under the t
                    distribution. As a result, the probability of getting values between −1 and 1 is
                        <em style="bold">smaller</em> under the t distribution than it is under the
                    Z distribution. Visually, the figure above shows that the area between the two
                    blue lines is smaller under the t distribution compared to the area under the Z
                    distribution.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. The t distribution is more spread out than the Z distribution

                    probability of getting values between −1 and 1? This can be visualized in the
                    figure above. Compare the area between the two blue lines under the Z
                    distribution (which we know is roughly 0.68) to that under the t distribution.
