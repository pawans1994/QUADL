            <title>Overview</title>
            <body><p>Now that we understand the process we go through in hypothesis testing and the logic
            behind it, we are ready to start learning about specific statistical tests (also known
            as significance tests).</p>
        <p>The first test we are going to learn is the test about the population proportion (p).
                    This is test is widely known as the <em>z-test for the population proportion
                        (p).</em> (We will understand later where the "z-test" part comes from.)</p>
        <p>When we conduct a test about a population proportion, we are working with a categorical
            variable. Later in the course, after we have learned a variety of hypothesis tests, we
            will need to be able to identify which test is appropriate for which situation.
            Identifying the variable as categorical or quantitative is an important component of
            choosing an appropriate hypothesis test.</p>
        <wb:inline idref="u4_m2_testprop1_tutor1" purpose="learnbydoing"/>
                <p>Our discussion of hypothesis testing for the population proportion p follows the four steps of hypotheses testing that we introduced in our general discussion on hypothesis testing, but this time we go into more details. More specifically, we learn how the test statistic and p-value are calculated and interpreted.</p> 
                <p>Once we learn how to carry out the test for the population proportion p, we discuss some general topics that are related to hypotheses testing. More specifically, we see what role the sample size plays and understand how hypothesis testing and interval estimation (confidence intervals) are related.</p>
       <!-- <p>In this part of our discussion on hypothesis testing, we will go into details that we did
                    not go into before. More specifically, we will use this test to introduce the
                    idea of a test statistic, and details about how p-values are calculated.</p>-->
        <p>Let's start by introducing the three examples, which will be the leading examples in our
                    discussion. Each example is followed by a figure illustrating the information
                    provided, as well as the question of interest.</p></body></section>
        <example>
            <title>1</title>
            <p>A machine is known to produce 20% defective products, and is therefore sent for
                repair. After the machine is repaired, 400 products produced by the machine are
                chosen at random and 64 of them are found to be defective. Do the data provide
                enough evidence that the proportion of defective products produced by the machine
                (p) has been <em>reduced</em> as a result of the repair?</p>
            <p>The following figure displays the information, as well as the question of
                interest:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image212.gif" alt="A large circle represents

&quot;is p still .20 or has it been reduced?&quot; We take a sample of 400 products, represented by
a smaller circle. We find that 64 of these are defective."/>
            <p>The question of interest helps us formulate the null and alternative

            <p>There are rumors that students at a certain liberal arts college are more inclined to
                use drugs than U.S. college students in general. Suppose that in a simple random
                sample of 100 students from the college, 19 admitted to marijuana use. Do the data
                provide enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of marijuana users among the
                students in the college (p) is <em>higher</em> than the national proportion, which
                is .157? (This number is reported by the Harvard School of Public Health.)</p>
            <p>Again, the following figure displays the information as well as the question of

            <p>As before, we can formulate the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of p, the

            <p>Polls on certain topics are conducted routinely in order to monitor changes in the
                public's opinions over time. One such topic is the death penalty. In 2003 a poll
                estimated that 64% of U.S. adults support the death penalty for a person convicted
                of murder. In a
