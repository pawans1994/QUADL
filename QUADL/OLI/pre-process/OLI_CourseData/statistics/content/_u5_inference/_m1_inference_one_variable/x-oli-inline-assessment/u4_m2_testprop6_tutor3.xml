                <p>Let's return to the scenario where we are studying the population of part-time
                    college students. We know that in 2008, 60% of this population was female. We
                    are curious if the proportion has decreased this year. We test the hypotheses:
                        H<sub>0</sub>: p = 0.60 and H<sub>a</sub>: p &lt; 0.60, where p is the
                    proportion of part-time college students that are female this year.</p>
                <p>Which of the following p-hat values will give the smallest p-value?</p>
                <p>p-hat =  <input_ref input="C"/></p>
            </body>
            <fill_in_the_blank id="C" shuffle="false">
                <choice value="one">14/25 = 0.56</choice>
                <choice value="two">12/25 = 0.48</choice>
                <choice value="three">10/25 = 0.40</choice>
            </fill_in_the_blank>
            <part id="p3">
                <response input="C" match="one">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. For the choices given, this is the p-hat with
                        the largest p-value.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response input="C" match="two">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. For H<sub>a</sub>: p &lt; 0.60, the
                        further the p-hat is from p = 0.60, the larger the test statistic in
                        magnitude and the smaller the p-value.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response input="C" match="three" score="1">
                    <feedback>Correct. For the alternative hypothesis H<sub>a</sub>: p &lt;
                        0.60, we are asking, "what is the probability of observing a test statistic
                        smaller than that given by the data?" Of the options given, the probability
                        is the smallest for p-hat = 0.40, since it is the furthest from p =
                        0.60.</feedback>
                </response>
                <hint>For the alternative hypothesis H<sub>a</sub>: p &lt; 0.60, the p-value is
                    the area to the left of the test statistic.</hint>

                    >here</link> to see graphs that illustrate the connections
                    between p-hat calculated from the data, the z-score, and the p-value. Graphs in
                    the top row are the sampling distributions for p-hat drawn as if H<sub>0</sub>
                    is true. Graphs in the bottom row are the distributions of z-scores with
                    p-values corresponding to the alternative hypothesis H<sub>a</sub>: p &lt;
                        p<sub>0</sub>.</hint>
                <hint>For the alternative hypothesis H<sub>a</sub>: p &lt; 0.60, p-hat = 0.40 is
                    the furthest from p = 0.60, so the test statistic from this data has the largest
                    magnitude and the smallest p-value for the stated H<sub>a</sub>.</hint>
