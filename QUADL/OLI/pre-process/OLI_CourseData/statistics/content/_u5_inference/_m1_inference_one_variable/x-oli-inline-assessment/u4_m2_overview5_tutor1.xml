                    <p>We are testing:</p>
                    <p>H<sub>o</sub>: The proportion of low birth weight births among women who
                        smoke during the pregnancy is .078 (same as in the general population).</p>
                    <p>H<sub>a</sub>: The proportion of low birth weight births among women who
                        smoke during the pregnancy is higher than .078.</p>
                    <p>Recall that as we learned, the null hypothesis (H<sub>o</sub>) says that
                        "nothing special is going on" or
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T163615-0500"?>there
                        is <?oxy_insert_end?>no change from the known proportion of .078. The
                        alternative hypothesis (H<sub>a</sub>) challenges H<sub>o</sub> and
                        represents what the study wanted to check.</p>
