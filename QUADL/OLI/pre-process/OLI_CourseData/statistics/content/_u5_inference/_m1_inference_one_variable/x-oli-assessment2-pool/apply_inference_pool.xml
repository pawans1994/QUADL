            <p>A researcher conducted a survey of graduating college students. 350 college students
                were randomly selected to answer the survey. One of the survey questions asked, “What
                are your plans after graduation?” 214 students said they were planning to find a
                job, 83 students said they were planning to attend graduate school, and 53 students
                did not reply to the question.</p>
            <p>What is the point estimate for the proportion of all college students who plan to
                find a job after graduation?</p>

                <feedback>Incorrect. This is the number of sampled college students who plan to
                    find a job after graduation. You need to find the sample proportion based on the
                    sample size of 350.</feedback>

            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. This is the number of sampled college students who plan to
                    attend graduate school. You need to find the sample proportion who plan to find

            <response match="C" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. The sample proportion who plan to find a job is 214/350 = 0.61.
                    This is the point estimator for the proportion of all college students who plan

                <feedback>Incorrect. It appears you found the proportion of students who said they
                    were planning to attend graduate school (83/350 = 0.24). You need to find the
                    sample proportion who plan to find a job based on the sample size of
                    350.</feedback>

            <p>A researcher conducted a survey of graduating college students. 350 college students
                were randomly selected to answer the survey. One of the survey questions asked, “How
                much do you owe in student loans?” The average student loan debt reported by
                respondents was $42,576 with a standard deviation of $2,801.</p>
            <p>$42,576 is the point estimate for which of the following?</p>
        </body>
        <input labels="false" shuffle="true">

            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. $42,576 is not a proportion (it is not a value between 0 and
                    1), thus it cannot be the point estimate for the proportion of all college
                    students who graduate college in debt.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Students were asked to report their loan debt, thus it cannot

                    college.</feedback>

            <response match="C" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. $42,576 is the sample mean loan debt. This is the point estimate
