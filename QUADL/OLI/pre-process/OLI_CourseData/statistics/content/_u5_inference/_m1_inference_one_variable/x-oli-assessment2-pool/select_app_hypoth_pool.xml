            <p>The makers of Mini-Oats cereal have an automated packaging machine that is set to
                fill boxes with 24 ounces of cereal. At various times in the packaging process, we
                select a random sample of 100 boxes to see whether or not the machine is filling the
                boxes with an average of 24 ounces of cereal.</p>
            <p>Which of the following is a statement of the null hypothesis?</p>
