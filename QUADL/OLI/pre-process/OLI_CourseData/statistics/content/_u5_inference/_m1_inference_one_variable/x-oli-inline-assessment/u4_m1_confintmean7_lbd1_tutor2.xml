  <question id="q1">
    <body>The mean birth weight in the general population is known to be roughly 3,450 grams. Based
      on this figure and the confidence interval you found in the previous question, what can you
      conclude?</body>
    <short_answer id="A"/>
    <part>
      <response input="A" match="*" score="10"/>
      <explanation>Since our 99% confidence interval (which provides a set of plausible values for
        &#956;) all lies below 3,450, we can conclude (with 99% certainty) that the mean birth
        weight of babies who are the first child born to mothers who are 35 or older is lower than
        the mean birth weight in the general population.</explanation>
