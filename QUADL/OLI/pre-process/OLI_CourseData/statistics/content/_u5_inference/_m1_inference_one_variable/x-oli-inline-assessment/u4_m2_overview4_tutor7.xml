            <body><p>Suppose that the p-value was not given, but instead the following conclusion was made: data
                    provides significant evidence that the average number of miles driven per year is less
                    than 12,000. Which of the following could have been the p-value?</p></body>

                <response match="A">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Since a p-value is a probability, it must be between 0 and
                        1. Please try again.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. The p-value must be less than 0.05 to provide enough
                        evidence to reject the null hypothesis and accept the
                        alternative.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. This p-value wouldn't provide significant evidence to
                        accept the alternative hypothesis. The p-value must be less than 0.05 for
                        this.</feedback>

                <response match="D">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Look at the first question, which did have this p-value.
                        What was the conclusion?</feedback>
