                <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that a confidence interval for a population mean
                    requires a large sample size (n &gt; 30) only if the population shape is unknown.
                    The population is normally distributed so a smaller sample size is sufficient in
                    this case.</feedback>

            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. A large sample size (n &gt; 30) is sufficient for calculating the
                    confidence interval for a population mean, even if population shape is

                <feedback>Correct. When the population distribution is unknown, a large sample size
                    (n &gt; 30) is required to calculate the confidence interval for a population
                    mean.</feedback>

            <response match="D" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The population is normally distributed and the sample size is
                    large (n &gt; 30) so we can calculate a confidence interval for a population
