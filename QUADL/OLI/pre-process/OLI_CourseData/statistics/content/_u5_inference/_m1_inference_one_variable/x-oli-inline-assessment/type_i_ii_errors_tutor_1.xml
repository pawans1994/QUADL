            <!--LO:Explain how to reduce Type I error-->
            <body>Given the type of error made in this situation, what could researchers do to
                reduce the risk of this error?</body>

                <response input="A" match="*" score="10"/>
                <hint>Remember, you are trying to reduce the likelihood of making a type I
                    error.</hint>
                <explanation>They could choose a .01 significance level instead of a .05
                    significance level, as this would reduce the probability of making a type I
                    error from 5 percent to 1 percent.</explanation>
