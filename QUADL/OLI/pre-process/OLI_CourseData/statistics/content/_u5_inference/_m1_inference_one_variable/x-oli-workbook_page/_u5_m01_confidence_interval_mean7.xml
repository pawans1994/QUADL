<title>When Is It Safe to Use the Confidence Interval We Developed?</title>
<body>
<p>One of the most important things to learn with any inference method is the conditions under which it is safe to use it. It is very tempting to apply a certain method, but if the conditions under which this method was developed are not met, then using this method will lead to unreliable results, which can then lead to wrong and/or misleading conclusions. As you'll see throughout this section, we  always discuss the conditions under which each method can be safely used.</p>
<p>In particular, the confidence interval for μ (when σ is known), <m:math overflow="scroll">

                    </m:math> is normal; in other words, that the Central Limit Theorem applies. In
                    particular, this allowed us to determine the values of z*, the confidence
                    multiplier, for different levels of confidence.</p>
<p>First, <em>the sample must be random.</em> Assuming that the sample is random, recall from the
                    Probability unit that the Central Limit Theorem works when the <em>sample size
                        is large</em> (a common rule of thumb for "large" is n &gt; 30), or, for
                        <em>smaller sample sizes</em>, if it is known that the quantitative
                        <em>variable</em> of interest is <em>distributed normally</em> in the
                    population. The only situation in which we cannot use the confidence interval,
                    then, is when the sample size is small and the variable of interest is not known
                    to have a normal distribution. In that case, other methods, called nonparametric
                    methods, which are beyond the scope of this course, need to be used. This can be
                    summarized in the following table:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image077.gif" alt="A table with two columns and two rows.
The column headings are: &quot;Small Sample Size&quot; and &quot;Large Sample Size.&quot; The row

Here is the data in the table by cell in &quot;Row, Column: Value&quot; format:
            Variable varies normally, Small sample size: OK;
            Variable varies normally, Large sample size: OK;

     <body> <p>Below are four different situations in which a confidence interval formula would be useful:</p>
    
    <p><em>Situation A:</em> A marketing executive wants to estimate the average
        time, in days, that a watch battery will last. She tests 50
        randomly selected batteries and finds that the distribution is
        skewed to the left, since a couple of the batteries were
        defective. It is known from past experience that the standard
        deviation is 25 days.</p>
    
    <p><em>Situation B:</em> A college professor desires an estimate of the mean
        number of hours per week that full-time college students are
        employed. He randomly selected 250 college students and found
        that they worked a mean time of 18.6 hours per week. He uses
        previously known data for his standard deviation.</p>
    
    <p><em>Situation C:</em> A medical researcher at a sports medicine clinic
        uses 35 volunteers from the clinic to study the average number
        of hours the typical American exercises per week. It is known
        that hours of exercise are normally distributed and past data
        give him a standard deviation of 1.2 hours.</p>
    
    <p><em>Situation D:</em> A high-end auto manufacturer tests 5 randomly
        selected cars to find out the damage caused by a 5 mph crash. It
        is known that this distribution is normal. Assume that the
        standard deviation is known.</p>

<em>What if </em>σ<em> is unknown?</em>
</p>
<p>As we discussed earlier, when variables have been
                    well<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T163012-0500"?>-<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T163012-0500" content=" "?>researched
                    in different populations it is reasonable to assume that the population standard
                    deviation
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T163023-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>σ<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T163024-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    is known.
                    However<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T163028-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    this is rarely the case. What if σ is unknown?</p>
<p>Well, there is some good news and some bad
                    news<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T163037-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T163037-0500" content="!"?></p>
<p>The good news is that we can easily replace the population standard deviation, σ, with the
                        <em>sample</em> standard
                    deviation<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T163055-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    s.</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image078.gif" alt="A large circle represents the population

represented by a smaller circle. We can find x-bar for this SRS, and we can also obtain S. We use this
instead of the unknown &sigma;."/>
<p>The bad news is that once σ has been replaced by s, we lose the Central Limit Theorem, together
                    with the normality of <m:math overflow="scroll">

                    </m:math>, and therefore the confidence multipliers z* for the different levels
                    of confidence (1.645, 2, 2.576) are (generally) not accurate any more. The new
                    multipliers come from a different distribution called the "t distribution" and
                    are therefore denoted by t* (instead of z*). We will discuss the t distribution
                    in more detail when we talk about hypothesis testing.</p>
<p>The confidence interval for the population mean (μ) when (σ) is unknown is therefore:</p>
<p>
<m:math overflow="scroll">
<m:mrow>

<m:mi>x</m:mi>

<m:msqrt>
<m:mi>n</m:mi>
</m:msqrt>
</m:mfrac>
</m:mrow>
</m:math>
</p>
<p>(Note that this interval is very similar to the one when σ is known, with the obvious changes: s
                    replaces σ, and t* replaces z* as discussed
                    above.)</p>
<p>There is an important difference between the confidence multipliers we have used so far (z*) and
                    those needed for the case when σ is unknown (t*). Unlike the confidence
                    multipliers we have used so far (z*), which depend only on the level of
                    confidence, the new multipliers (t*) have the <em>added complexity</em> that
                    they <em>depend on both the level of confidence and on the sample size</em> (for
                    example, the t* used in a 95% confidence when n = 10 is different from the t*
                    used when n = 40). Due to this added complexity in determining the appropriate
                    t*, we will rely heavily on software in this case.</p>

<p>1. Since it is quite rare that σ is known, this interval (sometimes called a <em style="italic">one-sample t
                    confidence interval</em>) is more commonly used as the confidence interval for
                    estimating μ. (Nevertheless, we could not have presented it without our extended
                    discussion up to this point,
