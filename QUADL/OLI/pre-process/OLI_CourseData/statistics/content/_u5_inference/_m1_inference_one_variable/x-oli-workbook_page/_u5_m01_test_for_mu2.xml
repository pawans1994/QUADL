                <p> Since our parameter of interest is the population mean (μ), once we collect the

                <p> However, we already know that in hypothesis testing we go a step beyond

                        that this last statement is the Central Limit Theorem. As a general

                <p>2. As we established earlier, all inference procedures are based on probability.
                    We are trying to determine if our sample results are likely or unlikely based on
                    our assumptions about the population. This requires that we have a probability
                    model that describes the long-term behavior of sample results that are randomly
                    collected from a population that fits our hypothesis. For this reason, the
                    Central Limit Theorem gives us criteria for deciding if the z-test for the
                    population mean can be used. We need to verify: </p>

            <p>Our data (represented by the sample mean concentration level&#8212;247) are 2.5
                standard deviations below the null value. A difference of 2.5 standard deviations is
                considered quite strong evidence against H<sub>o</sub>. (Essentially any difference
                that is above 2 standard deviations is considered quite large.) This will be
                confirmed when we find the p-value of the test. Here is an updated figure that
                represents the hypothesis testing process for this problem

                <p>Normal body temperature for healthy, at-rest human beings has always been said to
                    be 98.6&#176;F. A doctor has seen a lot of patients who had a lower or higher
                    body temperature when they were not ill. He has read research that says it is
                    actually lower. So, he collected 50 randomly selected temperatures that had a
                    mean of 98.4&#176;F. The standard deviation is known to be .35&#176;F.</p>
                <p>H<sub>o</sub>: μ = 98.6</p>

                <p>Each histogram in the questions below represents a random sample. We do not know
                    if the variable is distributed normally in the population, but we want to be
                    reasonably sure that the distribution of sample means will be normal so that we
                    can use the z-test for testing claims about the population mean. </p>
                <p> For each histogram, choose the option that best describes how to proceed with a
                    hypothesis test for a population mean.</p>
