            <body>When would you conclude that the average number of miles driven per year is less
                than 12,000?</body>

                <choice value="A">Never</choice>
                <choice value="B">When the p-value is large (more than 0.05)</choice>
                <choice value="C">When the p-value is small (less than 0.05)</choice>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. While we can never accept the null hypothesis, we can
                        accept the alternative hypothesis if there is sufficient evidence. Please
                        try again.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. If the p-value is &gt; 0.05 we would
                            <em style="italic">not</em> reject the null hypothesis. This question is asking when we

                    <feedback>Correct. We can accept H<sub>a</sub> if there is sufficient evidence,
                        namely that the p-value &lt; 0.05.</feedback>

                <response match="D">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. The key issue is whether the average number of miles is a
                        significant amount less than 12,000. Sometimes, even though the average is
                        less than 12,000, we would not reject the null hypothesis in favor of the
                        alternative hypothesis. Please try again.</feedback>
