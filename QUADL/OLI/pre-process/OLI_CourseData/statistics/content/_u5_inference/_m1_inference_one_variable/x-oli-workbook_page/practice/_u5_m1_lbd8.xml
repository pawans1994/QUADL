        <title>Hypothesis Testing for the Population Proportion p</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to give you a better sense of the p-value and, in
            particular, help strengthen your intuition about how it measures the evidence against
            the null hypothesis.</p>
        <p>
            <em>Background:</em>
        </p>
        <p>In this activity, we use example 2. Recall that we just completed this example and
            summarized it using the following figure:</p>
        <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/image276.gif"
            alt="The entire population is represented as a large circle, representing Students at the college. We are interested in p for this population,
which is the proportion which use marijuana. H_0: p = 0.157, H_a: p &gt; 0.157. From the population, we
generate a sample of 100 students and find that 19 use marijuana. Our conditions are met, and we
find that p-hat = 19/100 = 0.19, z = 0.91, and p-value = 0.182. We conclude that H_0 cannot be rejected."/>
        <p>We've seen that the evidence the data provided&#8212;19 marijuana users out of a sample
            of 100&#8212;is not enough for us to conclude that the proportion of marijuana users in
            the college is higher than the national figure (0.157). An interesting question,
            therefore, is: How many marijuana users out of 100 should we have found for it to be
            enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>? 19 was not enough, but what would have been
            enough? 21? 25?</p>

        <p>The table below will help you check your intuition. In the boldfaced row, we see our
            finding that when 19 out of 100 students are found to be users of marijuana, the test
            statistic is z = 0.91 (the table provides the non-rounded value), and the p-value is
            roughly 0.182 (indicating that 19 out of 100 users of marijuana does not provide enough
            evidence to conclude that p > 0.157).</p>
