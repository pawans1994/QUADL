            <title>4. Drawing Conclusions Based on the p-Value</title>
            <body>
                <p>This last part of the four-step process of hypothesis testing is the same across all statistical
                    tests, and actually, we've already said basically everything there is to say
                    about it, but it can't hurt to say it again.</p>
                <p>The p-value is a measure of how much evidence the data present against H<sub>o</sub>. The smaller
                    the p-value, the more evidence the data present against H<sub>o</sub>.</p>
                <p>We already mentioned that what determines what constitutes enough evidence against H<sub>o</sub>
                    is the <em>significance level</em> (α), a cutoff point below which the p-value
                    is considered small enough to reject H<sub>o</sub> in favor of H<sub>a</sub>.
                    The most commonly used significance level is 0.05.</p>
                <p>It is important to mention again that this step has essentially two sub-steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Based on the p-value, determine whether or not the results are significant (i.e., the data present enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>).</li>
                    <li>State your conclusions in the context of the problem.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Let's go back to our three examples and draw conclusions.</p>
                <example>
                    <title>1</title>
                    <p>(Has the proportion of defective products been reduced from 0.20 as a result of the repair?)</p>
                    <p>We found that the p-value for this test was 0.023.</p>
                    <p>Since 0.023 is small (in particular, 0.023 &lt; 0.05), the data provide enough evidence to reject
                        H<sub>o</sub> and conclude that as a result of the repair the proportion
                        of defective products has been reduced to below 0.20. The following figure
                        is the complete story of this example, and includes all the steps we went
                        through, starting from stating the hypotheses and ending with our
                        conclusions:</p>
                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image275.gif" alt="A large circle represents
                        the population of products produced by the machine (following the repair). We want to know p about
                        this population, or what is the proportion of defective products. The two hypotheses are H_0: p =
                        0.20 and H_a: p &lt; 0.20. We take a sample of 400 products, represented by a smaller circle. We find
                        that 64 of these are defective. p-hat = 64/400 = 0.16, and z = -2 and p-value = 0.023. Since the p-value is small we
                        conclude that H_0 can be rejected."/>
                </example>
                <example>
                    <title>2</title>
                    <p>(Is the proportion of students who use marijuana at the college higher than the national
                        proportion, which is 0.157?)</p>
                    <p>We found that the p-value for this test was 0.182.</p>
                    <p>Since 0.182 is <em>not</em> small (in particular, 0.182 &gt; 0.05), the data do not provide
                        enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>.</p>
                    <p>We therefore do <em>not</em> have enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of students at the college who use marijuana is higher than the national figure. Here is the complete story of this example:</p>
                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image276.gif" alt="A large circle represents
                        the population Students at the college. We want to know p about this population, or what is the
                        population proportion of students using marijuana. The hypotheses are H_0: p = 0.157 and H_a: p
                        &gt; 0.157. We take a sample of 100 students, represented by a smaller circle. We find that 19
                        use marijuana. p-hat = 19/100 = 0.19, z = 0.91, and p-value = 0.182. Since the p-value is too large,
                        we conclude that H_0 cannot be rejected."/>

                <example>
                    <title>3</title>
                    <p>(Has the proportion of U.S. adults who support the death penalty for convicted murderers changed
                        since 2003, when it was 0.64?)</p>
                    <p>We found that the p-value for this test was 0.021.</p>
                    <p>Since 0.021 is small (in particular, 0.021 &lt; 0.05), the data provide enough evidence to reject
                        H<sub>o</sub>, and we conclude that the proportion of adults who support
                        the death penalty for convicted murderers has changed since 2003. Here is
                        the complete story of this example:</p>
                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image277.gif" alt="A large circle represents
                        the population US Adults. We want to know p about this population, which is population proportion
                        which support the death penalty. The two hypothesis are H_0: p = 0.64 and H_a: p &ne; 0.64. We take
                        a sample of 1000 US Adults, represented by a smaller circle. We find that 675 are in favor. p-hat =
                        675/1000 = 0.675, z = 2.31, and p-value = 0.021. Because the p-value is small, we conclude that
                        H_0 can be rejected."/>
