    <question id="q1">
        <body>A similar poll was conducted 2 years ago, and reported the 95% confidence interval for
                p, the proportion of U.S. adults who believe the use of marijuana should be
                legalized, to be (.48 , .54). Do you think that the results of the current study
                (where the 95% confidence interval is (.53 , .59) provide evidence that the public
                opinion on the topic of legalization of marijuana has changed over the past two
                years?</body>

            <explanation>The answer is no, we do not have evidence to conclude that the public
                    opinion has changed. Here is why. The two confidence intervals (.48,<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T100540-0500"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>.54) and (.53,<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T100542-0500"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>.59)
                    overlap<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T100545-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    which means that there are some plausible values for p
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T100555-0500"?>that<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T100554-0500" content="which"?>
                    the two polls share (in particular, the values between .53 and .54), and we

                    rule out the possibility that p is one of these values. Click <link
