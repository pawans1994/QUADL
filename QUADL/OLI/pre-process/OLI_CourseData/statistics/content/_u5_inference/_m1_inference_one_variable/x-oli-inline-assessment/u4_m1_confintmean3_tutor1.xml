    <question id="q1">
        <body>The Golden Retriever Club of America conducted a study of 64 golden retrievers, and
            found the average age at death in the sample to be 11.0 years old. Letâ€™s assume the
            standard deviation of golden retriever lifespan is known to be 1.2 years (this is
            consistent with studies and with some other dog breeds). Give three confidence interval
            estimates for the unknown mean age at death for golden retrievers: first using 90%
            confidence, then 95%, and finally 99%. Please report your intervals in parenthesis
            notation, and please round your final values to the nearest tenth for simplicity. Be
            sure to notice the size of the intervals with the different confidence levels.</body>
