                <feedback>Incorrect. We actually do not know how many of the 513
                        couples reported on having sex more than twice in a typical week.

                        We cannot actually estimate this mean from the information given in the

                        since all we know is that 171 of the 513 sampled newlyweds go out more than
                        twice in a typical week (and not the actual number of times each couple goes
                        out in a typical week).</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. We are told that the mean number of times that the newlyweds in our
                        sample have sex in a typical
                       week is 2.35. 2.35 is, therefore, the point estimate for the
                        mean in the entire population (all newlyweds).</feedback>
