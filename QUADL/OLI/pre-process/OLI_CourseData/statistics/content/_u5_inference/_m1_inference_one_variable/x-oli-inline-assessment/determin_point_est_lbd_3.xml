        <multiple_choice shuffle="true">
            <choice value="A">The percentage of all college students who exercise on a regular
                basis</choice>
            <choice value="B">The mean time that all college students spend exercising per
                week</choice>
            <choice value="C">The mean time that all college students who exercise on a regular
                basis spend exercising per week</choice>

        <part>
            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The value 4.2 is an averageâ€”a mean calculated from the sample
                    and therefore is a point estimate for the population mean and not population
                    percentage or proportion.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The value 4.2 is not calculated using data from the entire
                    sample of college students (2,540) but rather from the subset of those students
                    who exercise on a regular basis.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. The value 4.2 was calculated using data only from the 1,742
                    students who exercise on a regular basis, and therefore, it is the point
                    estimate for the mean number of exercise hours per week in the population of
                    college students who exercise on a regular basis.</feedback>
            </response>

            <hint>Was the average of 4.2 hours of exercise per week calculated using data from all
                2,540 students or only from the 1,742 students who exercise on a regular
                basis?</hint>
