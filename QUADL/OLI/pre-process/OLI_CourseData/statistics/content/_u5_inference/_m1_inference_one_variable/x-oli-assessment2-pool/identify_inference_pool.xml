            <p>A random sample of 35 two-year colleges in 2008â€“2009 collected data on the in-state
                tuition costs and enrollment totals. Based on the sample, the researchers estimated
                the mean in-state tuition for all two-year colleges to be $2,380. Which form of
                statistical inference does this conclusion represent?</p>

                <feedback>Correct. $2,380 is a single value estimating the population mean in-state
                    tuition for all two-year colleges. In point estimation we estimate an unknown
                    parameter using a single number that is calculated from the sample
                    data.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. We are using a single value to estimate the population mean
                    in-state tuition. In interval estimation, we estimate an unknown parameter using
                    an interval of values that is likely to contain the true value of that parameter
                    (and state how confident we are that this interval indeed captures the true
                    value of the parameter). For example, "We are 95% confident that the mean
                    in-state tuition for all two-year colleges is between $2,000 and $3,000" is an

                    against the claim. In hypothesis testing, we have some claim about the
                    population, and we check whether or not the data obtained from the sample
                    provide evidence against this claim.</feedback>

            <p>A local fast food company sells a 16-oz soft drink. To determine if the soft drinks
                served contain less than the advertised 16 oz, a random sample of 20 drinks is
                chosen and the amount of drink in each cup is measured (without ice). The mean
                amount of soft drink was found to be 15.5 oz with a standard deviation of 0.4 oz.
                Based on the sample results we cannot claim that the soft drink contains less than
                16 oz. Which form of statistical inference does this conclusion represent?</p>
