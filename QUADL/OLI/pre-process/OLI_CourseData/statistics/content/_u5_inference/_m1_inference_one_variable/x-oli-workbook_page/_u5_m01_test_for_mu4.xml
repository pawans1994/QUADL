    <title>Hypothesis Testing for the Population Mean (4 of <!--9-->9)</title>

<body>
   
<p>So far, we've discussed the first three steps in the hypothesis testing process of the z-test for
            the population mean
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T221904-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>μ<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T221908-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>.
            The last step is to draw conclusions.</p>
<section>
<title>4. Drawing Conclusions</title>
<body>
<p> Here we assess the significance of the results (based on the p-value compared with some significance level of choice), and state our conclusions in context.</p>
<example>
<title>1</title>
<p>Here the p-value is quite large (.16) which means that it is not very surprising to get data like
                        those observed when
                            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T221951-0500"?>H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T221949-0500" content="Ho"?>
                        is true. The results are therefore not significant, and so we do not have
                        enough evidence to reject
                            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T222008-0500"?>H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T222005-0500" content="Ho"?>
                        and conclude that the mean SAT-M of all Ross College students is higher than
                        the national mean (500).</p>
<p> Note that even though the average SAT-M in our sample was 550 (which is substantially larger
                        than 500), since this result was based on a sample of only 4
                        students<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T222030-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        it does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the mean SAT-M is
                        higher than 500. We'll further explore this point in the next activity. Here
                        is the completed figure representing the hypothesis testing process for

all of the Students at Ross College. We are interested in finding &mu;, or the mean of the SAT-M
scores, which has a normal distribution. Our hypotheses are H_0: &mu; = 500 and H_a: &mu; &gt; 500,
assuming SD = 100. We take a sample from the population of size n = 4, represented by a smaller
circle. For this sample, x-bar = 550, and since our conditions are met, we can calculate that z = 1.
We also calculate that the p-value = .159 . This p-value is too high so we conclude that we
cannot reject H_0."/>

<p>In this

                        the p-value is quite small (.012). In particular, for a significance level
                        of .05, the p-value
                        indicate<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T222212-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>
