      <body>The null hypothesis in this case is:</body>
      <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
        <choice value="A">H<sub>0</sub>: p = 0.75</choice>
        <choice value="B">H<sub>0</sub>: p = 0.615</choice>

        <response match="A" score="10">
          <feedback>Correct. Indeed, the null hypothesis represents the claim of "no change." In
            this case, the null hypothesis claims that the proportion of Internet households that
            use dial-up connections remained 0.75, as estimated by the UCLA Internet Report a year
            before.</feedback>
        </response>
        <response match="B">
          <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that null hypothesis has the form H<sub>0</sub>: p =
              p<sub>0</sub>. The mistake in the answer you chose is that 804/1308 = 0.615 is the
            sample proportion, p-hat, and not the null value, p<sub>0</sub>. Read the problem
            description carefully, and try again.</feedback>
        </response>
        <response match="C">
          <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that the null hypothesis always has the form H<sub>0</sub>:
            p = p<sub>0</sub>.</feedback>
        </response>
        <response match="D">
          <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that the null hypothesis always has the form H<sub>0</sub>:
            p = p<sub>0</sub>.</feedback>

      <body>The alternative hypothesis in this case is:</body>

        <choice value="A">H<sub>a</sub>: p &gt; 0.75</choice>

      </multiple_choice>
      <part>
        <response match="A">
          <feedback>Incorrect. Note that we want to test whether the proportion of
            online households that have a dial-up connection has declined since the report was published.
            (Your choice would be appropriate if we wanted to test whether the proportion has
            increased.)</feedback>
        </response>
        <response match="B" score="10">
          <feedback>Correct. Since we want to test whether the proportion of online
            households that have a dial-up connection has declined since the report was published,
            the appropriate alternative is H<sub>a</sub>: p &lt; 0.75.</feedback>

        <response match="C">
          <feedback>Incorrect. Note that we want to test whether the proportion of
            online households that have a dial-up connection has declined since the report was published.
            (Your choice would be appropriate if we wanted to test whether the proportion has
            changed).</feedback>
        </response>
        <response match="D">
          <feedback>Incorrect. You are correct that for dial-up usage to decline, one would use
            "less than." But the proportion you used is p-hat, not the null value. </feedback>
