                <choice value="B">It is not safe to use the z-test for p, since the sample is not a
                    random sample from the entire population (or cannot be considered as

                    <feedback>Incorrect. Not all the conditions for using a z-test for p are

                    <feedback>Correct. Even though the sample is random, it is chosen from a
                        specific big metropolitan area and not from the entire population of U.S.
                        households. </feedback>
