                <hint>Recall that our conclusion is based on how small the p-value is. Here we're
                    using a .05 significance level, which means that if the p-value is less than
                    .05, we reject the null hypothesis H<sub>o</sub> and accept the alternative
                    hypothesis H<sub>a</sub>.</hint>
