        <p>Let's generalize the IQ example. Suppose that we are interested in estimating the unknown
            population mean (μ) based on a random sample of size n. Further, we assume that the
            population standard deviation (σ) is known.</p>

                <p>Note that for now we require the population standard deviation (σ) to be known.
                    Practically, σ is rarely known, but for some cases, especially when a lot of
                    research has been done on the quantitative variable whose mean we are estimating
                    (such as IQ, height, weight, scores on standardized tests), it is reasonable to
                    assume that σ is known. Eventually, we will see how to proceed when σ is
                    unknown, and must be estimated with sample standard deviation (s).</p>
                <p>Let's look at another example.</p>
                <example>

                    <p>An educational researcher was interested in estimating μ, the mean score on
                        the math part of the SAT (SAT-M) of all community college students in his
                        state. To this end, the researcher has chosen a random sample of 650
                        community college students from his state, and found that their average
                        SAT-M score is 475. Based on a large body of research that was done on the
                        SAT, it is known that the scores roughly follow a normal distribution with
                        the standard deviation <m:math overflow="scroll">

                    <p>Based on this information, let's estimate μ with a 95% confidence

                        <body>    <p>A study was done on pregnant women who smoked
                            during their pregnancies. In particular, the
                            researchers wanted to study the effect that smoking has on pregnancy
                            length. A sample of 114 pregnant women who were smokers participated in
                            the study and were followed until the birth of their child. At the end
                            of the study, the collected data were analyzed and it was found that the
                            average pregnancy length of the 114 women was 260 days. From a large
                            body of research, it is known that length of human pregnancy has a
                            standard deviation of 16 days.</p>

                    <p>You just gained practice computing and interpreting a confidence interval for
                        a population mean. Note that the way a confidence interval is used is that
                        we hope the interval contains the population mean μ. This is why we call it
                        an "interval <em>for the population mean</em>." </p>
                    <p>The following activity is designed to help you better understand<!--give you a better understanding of-->
                    the underlying

                    behind the interpretation of confidence intervals. In particular, you will gain
                    a deeper understanding of why we say that we are "<em style="italic">95% confident</em> that
                    the population mean is <em style="italic">covered</em> by the interval." </p>

                    <p>We just saw that one interpretation of a 95% confidence interval is that we
                    are 95% confident that the population mean (μ) is contained in the interval.
                    Another useful interpretation in practice is that, given the data, the
                    confidence interval represents the set of plausible values for the population
                    mean μ. </p>
                <example>
                    <p>As an illustration, let’s return to the example of mean SAT-Math score of
                        community college students. Recall that we had constructed the confidence
                        interval (467, 483) for the unknown mean SAT-M score for all community
                        college students. </p>
                    <p>Here is a way that we can use the confidence interval:</p>
                    <p>Do the results of this study provide evidence that μ, the mean SAT-M score of
                        community college students, is lower than the mean SAT-M score in the
                        general population of college students in that state (which is 480)?</p>
                    <p>The 95% confidence interval for μ was found to be (467, 483). Note that 480,
                        the mean SAT-M score in the general population of college students in that
                        state, falls inside the interval, which means that it is one of the
                        plausible values for μ.</p>

                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image050.gif" alt="A number line, on which
the 95% confidence interval for &mu; has been marked, from 467 to 483. At 480 is the mean SAT-M score in
the general population of college students in the state."/>
                    <p>This means that μ could be 480 (or even higher, up to 483), and therefore we
                        cannot conclude that the mean SAT-M score among community college students
                        in the state is lower than the mean in the general population of college
                        students in that state. (Note that the fact that most of the plausible
                        values for μ fall below 480 is not a consideration
                        here.)</p>

                    </m:math>, the 2 comes from the Standard Deviation Rule, which says that any
                    normal random variable (in our case <m:math overflow="scroll">

                        </m:mrow>
                    </m:math>), has a 95% chance (or probability of 0.95) of taking a value that is
                    within 2 standard deviations of its mean.</p>
                <p>As you recall from the discussion about the normal random variable, this is only
                    an approximation, and to be more accurate, there is a 95% chance that a normal
                    random variable will take a value within 1.96 standard deviations of its mean.
                    Therefore, a more accurate formula for the 95% confidence interval for μ is
