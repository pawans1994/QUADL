            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a U.S. government agency that regulates
                (you guessed it) food and drugs for consumer safety. One thing the FDA regulates is
                the allowable insect parts in various foods. You may be surprised to know that much
                of the processed food we eat contains insect parts. An example is flour.</p>
            <p>When wheat is ground into flour, insects that were in the wheat are ground up as
                well. The mean number of insect parts allowed in 100 grams (about 3 ounces) of wheat
                flour is 75. If the FDA finds more than this number, they conduct further tests to
                determine if the flour is too contaminated by insect parts to be fit for human
                consumption.</p>
            <p>The FDA takes a random sample of 35 bags of flour for evaluation and finds that they
                contain an average of 80 insect parts per 100 grams, with a standard deviation of
                6.3. </p>
            <p>Which hypothesis test should be used to determine whether the sample contains more
                than the allowed 75 insect parts per 100 grams?</p>

            <p>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (IQ test) is constructed so that Full Scale IQ
                scores follow a normal distribution, with a mean of 100, and a standard deviation of
                15. The mayor of Smart Town believes the county’s residents are smarter than the
                national average and wants to use it (the intelligence of the residents) as a
                marketing tool to bring industries to the area.</p>
            <p>A researcher is hired to conduct a study to determine whether Smart County’s
                residents have, on average, higher Full Scale IQs than the population. A random
                sample of 100 people from Smart County were given the IQ test and were found to have
                an average Full Scale IQ of 105.</p>
            <p>Which hypothesis test should be used to determine whether the mean Full Scale IQ
                score of the Smart County residents is higher than the national average?</p>

            <p>Water safety standards in southern California suggest that if a concentration of
                adenoviruses in the water is more than 1,000 per liter, further testing would have

                sources around San Diego showed an average of 1,023 adenoviruses per liter, with a
                standard deviation of 138.9.</p>

            <p>The dean of the engineering school at a technical university wants to emphasize the
                importance of having students who are gifted at reading and writing as well as math.

                programs at her school have significantly higher scores on the verbal reasoning
                section of the GRE (a standardized test used in the admissions process for many
                graduate programs) than the national average for engineering students. The national
                average for the verbal reasoning GRE score for engineering students was 150 with a
                standard deviation of 9. A random sample of 49 engineering graduate students at her
