                        <title>Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean (extra problems)</title>
            </head>
            <body>

                        <p>Below are four different situations where a confidence interval formula
                                    would be useful:</p>

                        <p><em>Situation A:</em> A marketing executive wants to estimate the average
                                    time, in days, that a watch battery will last. She tests 50
                                    randomly selected batteries and finds that the distribution is
                                    skewed to the left, since a couple of the batteries were
                                    defective. It is known from past experience that the standard
                                    deviation is 25 days.</p>

                        <p><em>Situation B:</em> A college professor desires an estimate of the mean
                                    number of hours per week that full-time college students are
                                    employed. He randomly selected 250 college students and found
                                    that they worked a mean time of 18.6 hours per week. He uses
                                    previously known data for his standard deviation.</p>

                        <p><em>Situation C:</em> A medical researcher at a sports medicine clinic
                                    uses 35 volunteers from the clinic to study the average number
                                    of hours the typical American exercises per week. It is known
                                    that hours of exercise are normally distributed and past data
                                    give him a standard deviation of 1.2 hours.</p>

                        <p><em>Situation D:</em> A high-end auto manufacturer tests 5 randomly
                                    selected cars to find out the damage caused by a 5 mph crash. It
                                    is known that this distribution is normal. Assume that the
                                    standard deviation is known.</p>
