    <question id="q1">
        <body>We know that the "upper tail probability" of 3 under the Z distribution, P(Z &gt; 3), is
            roughly 0.0015 (using the 99.7% part of the Standard Deviation Rule for the normal
            distributions). Which of the following do you think is the upper tail probability of 3
            under the t distribution in the figure above?</body>
        <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
            <choice value="A">0.0015, same as for Z</choice>
            <choice value="B">Larger than 0.0015</choice>
            <choice value="C">Smaller than 0.0015</choice>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Note that the t distribution is more spread out than the Z
                    distribution and, therefore, values that are further away from the mean (0) are
                    more likely. In particular, under the t distribution, it is more likely to get
                    values that are above 3 than under the Z distribution. Visually, you can see
                    that the t distribution has heavier tails and, therefore, the area under the t
                    distribution to the right of 3 is larger than the area to the right of 3 under
                    the Z distribution.</feedback>

    <question id="q2">
        <body>The 95th percentile of the Z distribution is 1.645, since P(Z &lt; 1.645) = 0.95, or
            P(Z &gt; 1.645) = 0.05. Which of the following do you think is the 95th percentile of
            the t distribution in the figure above?</body>
