                <p>Larger sample sizes give us more information to pin down the true nature of the
                    population. We can therefore expect
                    <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T150355-0500" comment="remove bold -- no emphasis needed"?>the

                    obtained from a larger sample to be closer to the population mean and
                    proportion, respectively. As a result, for the same level of confidence, we can
                    report a smaller margin of error, and get a narrower confidence interval. What
                    we've seen, then, is that larger sample size gives a boost to how much we trust
                    our sample results. In hypothesis

                    larger sample sizes have a similar effect. The following

represents the population Students at the college. We want to know p about this population, or
what is the population proportion of students using marijuana. The hypotheses are H_0: p = .157
and H_a: p &gt; .157 . We take a sample of 400 students, represented by a smaller circle, and
find that 76 use marijuana. Conditions are met to use our method, so p-hat = 76/400 = .19,
z = 1.81, and p-value = .035 . The p-value is low enough to let us conclude that we can reject

                <p>What do we learn from these two examples?</p>
                <p>We see that sample results

                    are based on a larger sample carry more weight. </p>
                <p>In example
                    2<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T151422-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    we saw that a sample proportion of .19 based on a sample of size
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T151428-0500"?>of
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>100 was not enough evidence that the proportion of marijuana
                    users in the college is higher than .157. Recall, from our general overview of
                    hypothesis testing, that this conclusion (not having enough evidence to reject
                    the null hypothesis) <em style="italic">doesn't</em> mean the null hypothesis is
                    necessarily true (so, we never “accept” the null); it only means that the
                    particular study didn’t yield sufficient evidence to reject the null. It <em
                        style="italic">might</em> be that the sample size was simply too small to
                    detect a statistically significant difference.</p>
                <p>However, in example
                    2*<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T151551-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    we saw that when the sample proportion of .19 is obtained from a sample of size
                    400, it carries much more weight, and in particular, provides enough evidence
                    that the proportion of marijuana users in the college is higher than .157 (the
                    national figure). In <em style="italic">this</em> case, the sample size of 400
                        <em style="italic">was</em> large enough to detect a statistically
                    significant difference.</p>
