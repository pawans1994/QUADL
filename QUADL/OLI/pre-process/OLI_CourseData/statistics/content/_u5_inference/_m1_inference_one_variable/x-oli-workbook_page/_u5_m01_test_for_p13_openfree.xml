            </m:math>. However, we do not get a more informative statement about its actual value.
            It might be of interest, then, to follow the test with a 95% confidence interval that
            will give us more insight into the actual value of p.</p>
        <example>

            <p>In our example 3,</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image277.gif" alt="A large circle represents
the population US Adults. We want to know p about this population, which is population proportion
which support the death penalty. The two hypothesis are H_0: p = .64 and H_a: p &ne; .64 . We take
a sample of 1000 US Adults, represented by a smaller circle. We find that 675 are in favor. p-hat =
675/1000 = .675, z = 2.31, and the p-value is .021 , which is small enough to let us reject H_0."/>
            <p>we concluded that the proportion of U.S. adults who support the death penalty for
                convicted murderers has changed since
                2003<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T172427-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                when it was .64. It is probably of interest not only to know that the proportion has
                changed, but also to estimate what it has changed to. We've calculated the 95%
                confidence interval for p on the previous page and found that it is (.645,
                .705).</p>
            <p>We can combine our conclusions from the test and the confidence interval and say:</p>
            <p>Data provide evidence that the proportion of U.S. adults who support the death
                penalty for convicted murderers has changed since 2003, and we are 95% confident
                that it is now between .645 and .705. (i.e. between 64.5% and 70.5%).</p>
        </example>
        <example>

            <p>Let's look at our example 1 to see how a confidence interval following a test might
                be insightful in a different way.</p>
            <p>Here is a summary of example 1:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image275.gif" alt="A large circle represents
the population of products produced by the machine (following the repair). We want to know p about
this population, or what is the proportion of defective products. The two hypotheses are H_0: p =
.20 and H_a: p &lt; .20. We take a sample of 400 products, represented by a smaller circle. We find
that 64 of these are defective. p-hat = 64/400 = .16, and z = -2 and p-value = .023 . Since the p-value is small we
conclude that H_0 can be rejected."/>
            <p>We conclude that as a result of the repair, the proportion of defective products has
                been reduced to below .20 (which was the proportion prior to the repair). It is
                probably of great interest to the company not only to know that the proportion of
                defective has been reduced, but also estimate what it has been reduced to, to get a
                better sense of how effective the repair was. A 95% confidence interval for p in
                this case is:</p>

            <p>We can therefore say that the data provide evidence that the proportion of defective
                products has been reduced, and we are 95% sure that it has been reduced to somewhere
                between 12.9% and 19.7%. This is very useful
                information<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T172546-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                since it tells us that even though the results were significant (i.e., the repair
                reduced the number of defective products), the repair might not have been

                enough<?oxy_insert_end?>, if it managed to reduce the number of defective products
                only to the range provided by the confidence interval. This, of course, ties back in
                to the idea of statistical significance vs. practical importance that we discussed
                earlier. Even though the results are significant
                    (<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T172656-0500"?>H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T172652-0500" content="Ho"?>
