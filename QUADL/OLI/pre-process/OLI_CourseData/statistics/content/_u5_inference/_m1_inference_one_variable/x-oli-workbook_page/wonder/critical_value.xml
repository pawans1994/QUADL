		<title>The Critical Value Method</title>
	</head>
	<body>



		<p>While we will be emphasizing the use of statistical software in obtaining the exact
			p-value. The critical value method provides the ability to get an understanding of
			whether or not a null hypothesis will be rejected at a given probability level (ex. .05
			or .01). In addition, for the z test, the Normal Table can be used to determine the
			exact probability level, without the use of statistical software. </p>
		<section>
			<title>Concepts of the Critical Value Method </title>
			<body>
				<p>There are several concepts that are important to understand in the critical value
					method. They are the: 1) critical value and 2) the critical region. As shown in
					the graph below, the <em style="bold">critical value </em>is the value, which
					cuts off an area referred to as the <em style="bold">critical region (or area of
						rejection), </em>as applied to the z test.</p>
			</body>
		</section>
		<image src="../../webcontent/critical_value/image1.png" alt="A N(0,1) curve with critical values
-|z| and |z| marked on the horizontal axis. The area to the left of -|z| is a critical region, and the area
to the right of |z| is also a critical region."/>
		<p>When z test statistics fall in the critical region (the <em style="bold">blue </em>shaded
			areas in the above graph), they are far enough from the mean that they are significantly
			different from the mean; therefore, in these instances, the null hypothesis would be
			rejected. The critical region is determined by a critical value that is based on two
			things: 1) the significance level of the test (either .05 or .01) <em style="bold">AND
			</em>the direction of the test (ex. left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed).</p>

			<title>Not Equal To</title>
			<body>
				<p>For a two-tailed z test, there will be critical regions on both sides of the
					distribution. For a two-tailed test using a .05 level of significance, we need
					to determine a value that would put .025 or 2.5%, in each tail. We can determine
					this value by using the Normal Table.</p>

				<p>First, we need to look in the body of the normal table (<activity_link
						idref="normal_table" target="new">click here</activity_link>), where we will
					see that the exact value .0250 is associated with the z score of -1.96; thus,
					-1.96 is the critical value that puts .025 (or 2.5%) in the left tail of the
					distribution. Since the standard normal distribution is symmetrical, +1.96 is
					the critical value that puts .025 (or 2.5%) in the right tail. Thus, the
					critical values of -1.96 and +1.96 would define the critical regions for a
					two-tailed z-test using a .05 significance level.</p>
				<image src="../../webcontent/critical_value/image2.png" alt="A N(0,1) curve titled
&quot;Critical Regions for a Two-Tailed z Test.&quot; The curve's horizontal axis has been marked with
critical values z = -1.96 and z = 1.96. The area to the left of -1.96 is a critical region, and the area
to the right of 1.96 is also a critical region."/>
				<p>In order to test the null hypothesis, we need to look at where the z-test
					statistic falls in relation to the critical regions formed by the critical
					values. In a two-tailed z-test, a z-test statistic of -1.5 would not fall in a
					critical region Therefore, we know that the p-value would be more than .05.
					Thus, we would not reject the null hypothesis, since the p-value is greater than
					.05 (or, stated another way, p-value &gt; .05).</p>
				<p>On the other hand, a z-test statistic of -2.5 would fall within the critical
					region on the left hand side of the distribution; t herefore, we know that the
					p-value would be less than .05. In this instance, we would reject the null
					hypothesis at a less than .05 level (or p-value &lt; .05). Furthermore, it is
					possible to figure out the exact p-value for the z-test statistic of -2.5, by
					using the Normal Table, which is .0062.</p>
				<image src="../../webcontent/critical_value/image3.png" alt="The N(0,1) curve on which
the critical value has been marked at -1.96 on the horizontal axis. In addition, the observed
test statistics -2.5 and -1.5 have been marked. -1.5 is to the right of -1.96 so it is not part
of the critical region, but -2.5 is to the left of -1.96, so it is part of the critical region."/>

			<title>Less Than</title>
			<body>
				<p>The same logic applies to one-tailed z-tests. For the one-tailed “less than”
					z-test, the critical value for a .05 significance level is -1.645 (note: since
					the p-value for -1.64 is .0505 and the p-value for -1.65 is .0495, the critical
					value for .0500 would be between the two z scores or -1.645).</p>
				<image src="../../webcontent/critical_value/image4.png" alt="A N(0,1) curve labeled
&quot;Critical Region for a 'Less Than' One-Tailed Test.&quot; The critical value for .05, -1.645,
has been marked on the horizontal axis. The area to the left of this critical value under the curve
is the critical region."/>
				<p>With a “less than” one-tailed z test, any z-test statistic that is <em
						style="bold">less</em> than -1.645, would fall in the critical region and
					therefore, would have a p-value less than .05. For instance, -2.5 would be less
					than -1.645 and would fall in the critical region. Thus, it would have a p-value
					less than .05 and the null hypothesis would be rejected.</p>
				<p>Any z-test statistic that is <em style="bold">larger</em> than -1.645 would have
					a probability level of greater than .05 (or p-value &gt; .05). For instance, -1.5
					would be greater than -1.645 and, therefore, would not fall in the critical
					region. Thus, it would have a p-value greater than .05 and the null hypothesis
					would not be rejected.</p>

			<title>Greater Than</title>
			<body>
				<p>For the one-tailed “greater than” z-test, the critical value for a .05
					significance level is 1.645.</p>
				<image src="../../webcontent/critical_value/image5.png" alt="A N(0,1) curve labeled
&quot;Critical Region for a 'Greater Than' One-Tailed Test.&quot; The critical value 1.645 has been
marked on the horizontal axis. The area to the right of this critical value under the curve is the
critical region."/>
				<p>Thus, with a “greater than” one-tailed z test, any z-test statistic <em
						style="bold">larger</em> than 1.645, would fall in the critical region and
					therefore, would have a p-value less than .05. For instance, 2.5 would be
					greater than 1.645 and would fall in the critical region. Thus, it would have a
					p-value less than .05 (or p-value &lt; .05) and the null hypothesis would be
					rejected .</p>
				<p>Any z-test statistic that <em style="bold">less </em>than 1.645 would have a
					probability level of greater than .05 (or p-value&gt;.05). For instance, 1.5
					would be less than 1.645 and, therefore, would not fall in the critical region.
					Thus, it would have a p-value greater than .05 and the null hypothesis would not
					be rejected.</p>

			<title>Wrapup:</title>
			<body>
				<p>The critical value method uses two concepts: 1) the critical value and 2) the
					critical region. The critical value is used to determine the critical region and
					is based on two things: 1) the significance level of the test (either .05 or
					.01) <em style="bold">AND </em>the direction of the test (ex, left-tailed,
					right-tailed, or two-tailed).</p>

				<p>When z-test statistic falls in the critical region, it is far enough from the
					mean that it is significantly different from the mean. Therefore, in this
					instance, the null hypothesis would be rejected at the significance level used
					to determine the critical region (either .05 or .01). Furthermore, the actual
					p-value can be determined by using the Normal Table.</p>
				<p>When the z-test statistic does not fall in the critical region, it indicates that
					it is not far enough from the mean to be significantly different from the mean.
					In this instance, the null hypothesis would not be rejected.</p>

			<title>Comment:</title>
			<body>
				<p>The critical value method has been traditionally used for hypothesis testing
					(note: there are different critical values and tables for t-tests, ANOVAs, and
					Chi Square tests). The emphasis now, however, is on the use of exact p-values,
					which are obtained through the use of statistical software packages.</p>

				<p>An Association of American Medical Colleges report stated that, in 2011-2012,
					47.0% of all matriculated medical school students in the United States were
					female. It is thought that, perhaps, the number of matriculated female students
					may be lower in rural areas. Researchers collect a random sample of 1000
					2011-2012 matriculated medical students from rural areas and find that 435 of
					the students were female. </p>
				<p>Were there proportionately fewer females matriculated medical students in rural
					areas as compared to the national proportion of female matriculated medical
					students?</p>
