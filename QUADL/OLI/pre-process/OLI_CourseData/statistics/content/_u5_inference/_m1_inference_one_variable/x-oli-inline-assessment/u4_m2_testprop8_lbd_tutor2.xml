    <question id="q1">
        <body>At the 0.05 significance level, how high does the number of marijuana users in the
            sample need to be for there to be enough evidence to reject H<sub>0</sub> and conclude
            that indeed p &gt; 0.157? Answer the same question for a significance level of 0.01.
            How do your answers to this question compare with your intuitive answer to question
            1?</body>

                    >This table</link> provides the answer. A random sample of size 100 with 22
                marijuana users would be enough evidence to reject H<sub>0</sub> at the 0.05
                significance level. In order to be able to reject H<sub>0</sub> at the more
                conservative 0.01 significance level, a random sample of size 100 with 25 (or more)
                marijuana users is needed. </explanation>
