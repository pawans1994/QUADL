                        Indeed, when the p-value is not small (in this case, above .05) our
                        conclusion is that we don't have enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>, or
                        equivalently, that we don't have enough evidence to accept
                        H<sub>a</sub>.</feedback>

                <response match="C">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that it is when the p-value is not
                        small (in our case, above .05) that we conclude that we don't have enough
                        evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>, or equivalently, that we don't have enough
                        information to accept H<sub>a</sub>. </feedback>

                <hint>Recall that our conclusion is based on how small the p-value is. Here we're
                    using a .05 significance level, which means that if the p-value is less than
                    .05, we would reject the null hypothesis

                    and accept the alternative hypothesis

                <hint>In this case, the conclusion we reached was that we don't have evidence to
                    reject the null hypothesis, which means that the p-value was over .05.</hint>
                <hint>Now that we know that the p-value was over .05, the only reasonable choice out
                    of the ones given is .125. The .045 choice is no

                    because it is below .05, and the two choices for 1.96 and -1.96 are no good
                    because we know that a p-value must be between 0 and 1.</hint>
