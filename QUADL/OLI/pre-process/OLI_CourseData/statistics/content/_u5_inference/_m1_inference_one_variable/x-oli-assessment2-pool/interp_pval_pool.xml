            <p>A tire manufacturer has a 60,000-mile warranty for tread life. The manufacturer
                considers the overall tire quality to be acceptable if less than 8% are worn out at
                60,000 miles.</p>
            <p>The manufacturer tests 250 tires that have been used for 60,000 miles. They find that
                15 of them are worn out. With this data, we test the following hypotheses at the 5%
                significance level.</p>
            <p> H<sub>0</sub>: The proportion of tires that are worn out after 60,000 miles is equal

            <p>A researcher wants to find out if there is a significant difference between men and

            <p>A government health official is interested in whether there has been a statistically
                significant decrease in teen smoking rates. In 2013, 8.4 percent of 12th graders had

            <p>The health official surveys 200 randomly selected 12th graders and finds that 14 of
