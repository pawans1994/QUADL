            <body><p>A researcher wanted to estimate µ, the mean number of hours that students at a
                    large state university spend exercising per week. The researcher collects data
                    from a sample of 150 students who leave the university gym following a
                    workout.</p>
                <p>Which of the following is true regarding x&#772;, the average number of hours
                    that the 150 sampled students exercise per week?</p>
            </body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="false" select="single">
                <choice value="A">It is an unbiased estimate for µ.</choice>
                <choice value="B">It is not an unbiased estimate for µ and probably underestimates
                    µ.</choice>
                <choice value="C">It is not an unbiased estimate for µ and probably overestimates µ. </choice>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Is a sample of 150 students who finished a workout (even if
                        chosen at random) a random sample from the entire student body?</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. It is true that it is not an unbiased estimator for µ
                        because the sample was not a random sample of 150 students from the entire
                        student body. However, students who leave the university gym following a
                        workout are likely to be students who exercise on a regular basis, so do you
                        think that they tend to exercise less or more, on average, than students in
                        general?</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. It is not an unbiased estimator for µ because the sample was
                        not a random sample of 150 students from the entire student body. In
                        addition, students who leave the university gym following a workout are
                        likely students who exercise on a regular basis and therefore tend to
                        exercise more, on average, than students in general.</feedback>
