      <body>The parameter of interest is p, the proportion of college students who report that
        computer gaming is an obstacle to their success in college. The null hypothesis claims that
        p = 0.30. Which of the following give the most convincing evidence against
        H<sub>o</sub>?</body>

          <feedback>Incorrect. It is true that the sample proportion is 0.40 for each
