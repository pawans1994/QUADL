            <body>
                <p>Was your second sample mean x-bar (the new dot) the same value as your first
                    sample mean? (That is, is it in the same relative location along the axis?) Why is
                    this result to be expected?</p>

                <response input="A"  match="*" score="1"/>
                <explanation><p><em>No</em>, the new x-bar value won't be the same.</p>
                    <p>This result is to be expected because there is a natural <em>variation</em>
                        due to sampling. (This is a key idea in this course.)</p>
