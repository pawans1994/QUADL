            <p>A quality control engineer at a potato chip company tests the bag-filling machine by
                weighing bags of potato chips. Not every bag contains exactly the same weight. But
                if more than 15% of bags are overfilled, then they stop production to fix the
                machine.</p>
            <p>They define overfilled to be more than 1 ounce above the weight on the package. The
                engineer weighs 100 bags and finds that 21 of them are overfilled.</p>
            <p>He plans to test the hypotheses: H<sub>0</sub>: p = 0.15 versus H<sub>a</sub>: p &gt;
                0.15 (where p is the true proportion of overfilled bags). What is the test
                statistic?</p>

                community college students.</p>
            <p>She selects 300 community college students at random and finds that 120 of them have
                a smartphone. In testing the hypotheses H<sub>0</sub>, P = 0.35, versus

            <p>A manufacturer of t-shirts marks a shirt as “irregular” when it has defects such as
                crooked seams, stains, rips, or holes. A small number of irregular t-shirts are
                expected as part of the manufacturing process, but if more than 8% of the t-shirts
                manufactured at a plant are classified as irregular, the manager has to do an
                investigation to try to find the source of the increased mistakes in the
                manufacturing process.</p>
            <p>In order to test whether his plant is making a higher than expected number of
                irregular t-shirts, the manager of a plant randomly selects 100 t-shirts and finds

            <p>According to a 2015 survey by mobile loyalty company SessionM, 47% of smartphone
                users preferred online shopping to in-store shopping. A professor at a local
                community college believes that the percentage of smartphone users who prefer online
                shopping may be higher among community college students.</p>
            <p>She randomly selects 150 community college students with smartphones and she finds
                that 84 of the students surveyed prefer online shopping. In testing the hypotheses:
                    H<sub>0</sub>: p = 0.47 versus H<sub>a</sub>: p &gt; 0.47, she calculates the
