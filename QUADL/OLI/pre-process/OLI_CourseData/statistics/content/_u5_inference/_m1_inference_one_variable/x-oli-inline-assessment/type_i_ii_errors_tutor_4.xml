            <!--LO:Explain how to reduce type II errors in Context-->
            <body>
                <p>A researcher looks at the mean salaries of male and female electricians and
                    decides based on the evidence that there is no difference between the two
                    groups. Given that there was a failure to reject the null hypothesis, it is
                    possible that a type II error was made.</p>
                <p>Given the type of error made in this situation, what could researchers do to
                    reduce the risk of this error?</p>
            </body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="true" select="single">
                <choice value="A">Choose a .01 significance level, instead of a .05 significance
                    level.</choice>
                <choice value="B">Increase the sample size.</choice>
            </multiple_choice>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Choosing a smaller significance level will decrease the
                        chance of a type I error, because it will make it more difficult to reject
                        the null hypothesis. As this is a type II error, the best approach would be
                        to increase the sample size.</feedback>

                <response match="B" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. Increasing the sample size is the best way to reduce the
                        likelihood of a type II error.</feedback>

            <body>
                <p>Which of the following statements is true regarding reducing the likelihood of
                    type I and type II errors?</p>
            </body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="false" select="single">
                <choice value="A">Both error types can be reduced by increasing the sample
                    size.</choice>
                <choice value="B">Both error types can be reduced by choosing a smaller significance
                    level &#945;.</choice>
                <choice value="C">Both error types can be reduced by choosing a larger significance
                    level &#945;.</choice>
                <choice value="D">Both error types cannot be reduced simultaneously.</choice>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Increasing the sample size only reduces the chance of type
                        II error, and actually increases the chance of type I error. </feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. Choosing a smaller significance level only reduces the

                    <feedback>Correct. Increasing the sample size decreases the change of type II
                        error but increases the chance of type I error. Choosing a smaller
                        significance level reduces the chance of type I error but increases the
                        chance of type II error. </feedback>
