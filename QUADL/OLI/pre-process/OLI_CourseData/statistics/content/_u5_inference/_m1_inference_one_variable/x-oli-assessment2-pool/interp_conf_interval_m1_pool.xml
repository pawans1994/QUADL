            <p>A study was conducted to estimate μ, the mean number of weekly hours that U.S.
                adults use computers at home. Suppose a random sample of 81 U.S. adults gives a mean
                weekly computer usage time of 8.5 hours and that from prior studies, the population
                standard deviation is assumed to be σ = 3.6 hours. </p>
            <p>A similar study conducted a year earlier estimated that μ, the mean number of
                weekly hours that U.S. adults use computers at home, was 8 hours. We would like to
                test (at the usual significance level of 5%) whether the <em>current</em> study
                provides significant evidence that this mean has changed since the previous year. </p>
            <p>Using a 95% confidence interval of (7.7, 9.3), which of the following is an
                appropriate conclusion?</p>
