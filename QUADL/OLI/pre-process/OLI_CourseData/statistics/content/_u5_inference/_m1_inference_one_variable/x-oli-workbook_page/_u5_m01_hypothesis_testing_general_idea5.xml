                        <p>We learned quite a lot about hypothesis testing. We learned the logic
                    behind it, what the key elements are, and what types of conclusions we can and
                    cannot draw in hypothesis testing.

--use symbols for Ho and Ha.
--say &quot;summarized with&quot; rather than &quot;summarized by&quot;
--change --&gt; to real arrows
-- lowercase the p and v in p-value throughout
-- in the text, the process is four steps long. This walkthrough mentions (and numbers on the screen just three steps (it condenses two steps). "?>Here
                    is a quick recap:<?oxy_comment_end?></p>

                            <body>           <p><em>Background:</em> Based on the National Center of Health Statistics, the proportion
                    of babies born at low birth weight (below 2,500 grams) in the United States is
                    roughly .078, or 7.8% (based on all the births in the United States in the year
                    2002). A study was done in order to check whether smoking by pregnant women
                    increases the risk of low birth weight. In other words, the researchers wanted
                    to check whether the proportion of babies born at low birth weight among women
                    who smoked during their pregnancy is higher than the proportion in the general
                    population. The researchers followed a sample of 400 women who had smoked during
                    their pregnancy and recorded the birth weight of the newborns. Based on the
                    data, the p-value was found to be .016.</p>

        <body><p>The same researchers also wanted to examine whether second-hand
            smoking (exposure to a another person smoking) by pregnant women increases the
            risk of low birth weight (i.e., the proportion of babies born at a low birth
            weight among women who were second-hand smokers during their pregnancy is higher
            than the proportion in the general population). The researchers obtained a
            sample of 175 pregnant women who were second-hand smokers, followed them during
            their pregnancies, and found that 10.2% of the newborns had low birth weight.
            Based on these data, the p-value was found to be .119.</p>
