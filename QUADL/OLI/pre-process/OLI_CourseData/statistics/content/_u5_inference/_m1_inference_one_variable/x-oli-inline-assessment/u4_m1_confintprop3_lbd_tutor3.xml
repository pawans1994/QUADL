What is the margin of error of the confidence interval you found in question 2?  Comment on the apparent discrepancy.</body><short_answer id="A"/><part><response input="A" match="*" score="10"/><explanation><p>The 95% confidence interval for p, (.10,.14) has a width of .04, and therefore a margin of error
          of .02 (or 2%). In question 1, though, we found that the margin of error of this poll is
          roughly 2.9%. This is
          <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T114515-0500"?>because in question
          1, we calculated a
          <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T114544-0500" content="a great example to show you what we mean by"?>
          "conservative" margin of error. The margin of error found in question 1 was found using
          the conservative
          approach<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T114556-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
          and is the margin of error of the whole poll. What it says is:</p><p>Based on this sample size, the margin of error for any of the questions in this poll will be no more than 2.9% regardless of what the sample proportions are.</p><p>In the particular question from the poll in this example, the margin of error happened to be lower.</p></explanation></part></question></assessment>
