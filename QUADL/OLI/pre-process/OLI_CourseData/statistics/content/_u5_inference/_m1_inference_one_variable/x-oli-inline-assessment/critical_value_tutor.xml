                <response match="A" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. The z-test statistic is calculated by using the formula

                    <feedback>Incorrect. It looks like the proportion for the sample

                <hint>To calculate the z-test statistic, you need the proportion for the population,

            <body>Is the proportion of female students in the sample from the rural areas

                    <feedback>Incorrect. While the sample proportion is significantly
                        lower than the population, it is not because the z-statistic is more than

                    <feedback>Correct. Since the z-test statistic (−2.218) is less than the critical
                        value for a one-tailed test at the 0.05 significance level (−1.645), it falls
                        in the critical region. Thus, we can say that the probability of this z-test
                        statistic is less than 0.05. Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected, and we
                        can say that there are proportionately fewer female matriculated female
