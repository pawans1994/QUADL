            <body>How is the test statistic affected if  p-hat = 0.74 as before? Choose the correct statement.</body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
                <choice value="A">The test statistic is still about 1 since the distance between p-hat and p<sub>o</sub> is the same as before. </choice>
                <choice value="B">The test statistic increases to about 2 since p-hat = 0.74 is
                    about 2 standard deviations above p<sub>o</sub> = 0.64.</choice>
                <choice value="C">The test statistic decreases to about 0.5 since the standard deviation decreased to half of its previous size.</choice>

                    <feedback>Incorrect.  The test statistic is the number of standard deviations that p-hat is from p<sub>o</sub>.  Please try again.</feedback>

                <response match="B" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct.  Since the standard deviation is now 0.05, the distance of 0.10 is now 2 standard deviations.</feedback>

            <body>For which sample size does p-hat = 0.74 provide stronger evidence against a null

                <response match="C" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct.  Sampling distributions for large samples have less variability. So p-hat = 0.74 will be more standard deviations from p = 0.60, giving a larger test statistic and stronger evidence against H<sub>o</sub>.</feedback>
