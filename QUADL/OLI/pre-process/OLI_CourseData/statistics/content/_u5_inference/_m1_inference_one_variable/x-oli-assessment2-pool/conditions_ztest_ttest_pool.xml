            <p>An automatic coffee machine dispenses cups of coffee whose volume per cup varies
                normally with the mean μ = 10 oz. A quality-control researcher randomly selects
                8 cups of coffee from the machine and finds that in this sample the mean volume is
                9.92 oz. and the standard deviation is 0.23 oz.</p>
            <p>We want to determine if these data provide enough evidence to conclude that the mean
                volume per cup is below the target level.</p>
            <p>Which one of the two outputs represents the correct way to conduct this test?</p>
