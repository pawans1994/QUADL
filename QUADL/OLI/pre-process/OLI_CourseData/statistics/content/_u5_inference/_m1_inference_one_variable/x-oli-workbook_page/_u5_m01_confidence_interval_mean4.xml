        <p>So far, we've developed the confidence interval for the population mean from scratch,
            based on results from probability, and discussed the trade-off between the level of
            confidence and the precision of the interval. The price you pay for a higher level of
            confidence is a lower level of precision of the interval (i.e., a wider interval).</p>
        <p>Is there a way to bypass this trade-off? In other words, is there a way to increase the
            precision of the interval (i.e., make it narrower) <em style="italic">without</em>
            compromising on the level of confidence? We will answer this question shortly, but first
            we need to get a deeper understanding of the different components of the confidence
            interval and its structure.</p>

            <title>Understanding the general structure of the confidence intervals</title>
            <body>
                <p>We explored the confidence interval for μ for different levels of confidenceand
                    found that, in general, it has the following form:</p>

                <p>where z* is a general notation for the multiplier that depends on the level of
                    confidence. As we discussed before:</p>
                <p>For a 90% level of confidence, z* = 1.645</p>
                <p>For a 95% level of confidence, z* = 2 (or 1.96 if you want to be really
                    precise)</p>
                <p>For a 99% level of confidence, z* = 2.576</p>
                <p>To start our discussion about the structure of the confidence interval, let's

                    <em>m</em> is called the <em style="italic">margin of error</em>, since it
                    represents the maximum estimation error for a given level of confidence.</p>
                <p> For example, for a 95% confidence interval, we are 95% sure that our estimate

either added to or subtracted by the margin of error (m). The margin of error is composed of the

                <p>This structure:</p>

                <p>where the margin of error is further composed of the product of a confidence
                    multiplier and the standard deviation (or, as we'll see, the standard error) is
                    the general structure of all confidence intervals that we will encounter in this
                    course.</p>
                <p>Obviously, even though each confidence interval has the same components, what
                    these components actually are is different from confidence interval to
                    confidence interval, depending on what unknown parameter the confidence interval
                    aims to estimate.</p>
                <p>Since the structure of the confidence interval is such that it has a margin of
                    error on either side of the estimate, it is centered at the estimate (in our
                    case, <m:math overflow="scroll">

                        </m:mrow>
                    </m:math>), and its width (or length) is exactly twice the margin of error:</p>

                    alt="A number line, on which the estimate has
been placed. To the left and to the right are two intervals with the size m. So, the confidence interval,
which comprises of both margins of errors (the left one and right one) is of width 2m."/>
                <p>The margin of error, m, is therefore "in charge" of the width (or precision) of
                    the confidence interval, and the estimate is in charge of its location (and has
                    no effect on the width).</p>
