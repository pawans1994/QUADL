			<p> A study was conducted in order to estimate &#956;, the mean number of weekly hours

				<p> A similar study conducted a year earlier estimated that &#956;, the mean number of weekly

			<p> The next two questions refer to

			<p> In June 2005, a CBS News/NY Times poll asked a random sample of 1,111 U.S. adults the
				following question: "What do you think is the most important problem facing this
				country today?" Roughly 19% of those sampled answered "the war in Iraq" (while the
				rest answered economy/jobs, terrorism, healthcare, etc.). Exactly a year prior to
				this poll, in June of 2004, it was estimated that roughly 1 out of every 4 U.S.
				adults believed (at that time) that the war in Iraq was the most important problem
				facing the country. </p>
			<p> We would like to test whether the 2005 poll provides significant evidence that the
