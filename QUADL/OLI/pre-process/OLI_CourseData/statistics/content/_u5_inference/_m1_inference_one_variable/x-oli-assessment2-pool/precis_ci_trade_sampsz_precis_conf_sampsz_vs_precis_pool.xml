            <p>A study was conducted to estimate μ, the mean number of weekly hours that U.S.
                adults use computers at home. Suppose a random sample of 81 U.S. adults gives a mean
                weekly computer usage time of 8.5 hours and that from prior studies, the population
                standard deviation is assumed to be σ = 3.6 hours. The 95% confidence interval
                for the mean, μ, is (7.7, 9.3).</p>
            <p>Which of the following will provide a more informative (i.e., narrower) confidence
                interval than the 95% confidence interval? Check all that apply.</p>
