        <response match="A">
          <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that p represents a <em>proportion</em>, not a
            whole number, so the hypothesized value must be a proper decimal (between 0 and 1).
            Furthermore, we should be able to formulate the hypotheses <em style="italic">before</em>
            seeing the result of the particular study, so the hypothesis value can’t involve a
            quantity from any particular sample. </feedback>

        <response match="B">
          <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that the null hypothesis is always of the
            form: <em style="italic">population parameter symbol = certain value</em>.  </feedback>

        </response>
        <response match="D">
          <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that the null hypothesis is always about what we think would
            be true if there were "nothing unusual," or, in this case, if the store were
              "innocent" of switching to substandard manufacturing. Furthermore, we should
            be able to formulate the hypotheses <em style="italic">before</em> seeing the result of the particular
            study, so the hypothesis value can’t be the statistic from any particular sample. Try
            again.</feedback>
        </response>
        <response match="E" score="10">
          <feedback>Correct. The null hypothesis is always a formal statement of "nothing unusual,"
            or, in this case, "innocence" on the part of the store (the store did not switch to a
            substandard manufacturer). In this case, the null hypothesis is the formal statement
            that p (the overall proportion of defective shirts at the store today) is still the same
            as the prior defect rate.</feedback>

          <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that the alternative hypothesis never has the
            equal sign. Furthermore, we should be able to formulate the hypotheses <em style="italic">before</em> seeing the

          <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that the alternative hypothesis never has the equal
