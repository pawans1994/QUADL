            <p>In our case:</p>

          <?oxy_insert_end?>316</p>
            <p>&#8226; p-hat = 40/316 â‰ˆ .127</p>
            <p>&#8226; p<sub>o</sub> = .035</p>
            <p>And therefore,</p>
            <image src="../../../webcontent/inline_assessment/_u5_m1_lbdtutor9d_image1.jpg" alt="z score = 8.9"/>
            <p>z<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T135315-0500"?>

          <?oxy_insert_end?>8.9 means that assuming that the H<sub>o</sub> is true (i.e., that the
          proportion of contaminated drinking water on airplanes is indeed .035,
          <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T135332-0500"?>the
          <?oxy_insert_end?>same as drinking water in general), the results of our study provided a
          sample proportion that is 8.9 standard deviations above that proportion.</p>
            <p>Recall that the standard deviation rule for normal distributions tells us that 99.7%
          of normal values fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean. A sample proportion that
          falls 8.9 standard deviations above the true
          proportion<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T135356-0500" content=","?>

          extremely unlikely. As you'll see, this fact will also be expressed by the p-value.</p>
