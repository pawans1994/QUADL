        <title>Hypothesis Testing for the Population Proportion p</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to give you hands-on practice in following up a test for
            the population proportion p in which H<sub>o</sub> has been rejected with a confidence
            interval, and getting a sense of how the confidence interval is a natural and
            informative supplement to the test in these cases.</p>
        <p>
            <em>Background:</em>
        </p>
        <p>Recall from a previous activity the results of a study on the safety of airplane drinking
            water that was conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A study
            found that out of a random sample of 316 airplanes tested, 40 had coliform bacteria in
            the drinking water drawn from restrooms and kitchens. As a benchmark comparison, in 2003
            the EPA found that about 3.5% of the U.S. population have coliform bacteria-infected
            drinking water. The question of interest is whether, based on the results of this study,
            we can conclude that drinking water on airplanes is more contaminated than drinking
            water in general. Let p be the proportion of contaminated drinking water on
            airplanes.</p>
        <p>In a previous activity we tested H<sub>o</sub>: p = .035 vs. H<sub>a</sub>: p &gt; .035
            and found that the data provided extremely strong evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub> and
            conclude that the proportion of contaminated drinking water in airplanes is larger than
            the proportion of contaminated drinking water in general (which is .035). </p>
        <p>Now that we've concluded that, all we know about p is that we have very strong evidence
            that it is higher than .035. However, we have no sense of its magnitude. It will make
            sense to follow up the test by estimating p with a 95% confidence interval.</p>

                    <!-\- There is no excel option here, because the point of the minitab exercise is to show how to calculate the CI in Minitab rather than by hand.  If you do it in Excel, you can only do it by hand in the first place. -\->

                    <em>Comment: </em>The confidence interval for the population proportion p will
                    appear in the Minitab output only in case the two-sided alternative (not equal)
                    is selected. Therefore, if following a one sided-test where Ho has been rejected
                    you would like to estimate p with a 95% confidence interval (as is the case
                    here), you'll need to ask Minitab to carry out the two-sided test (even though
                    it is of no interest to you as a test) just in order to retrieve that confidence
                    interval from the output.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose: Stat -&gt; Basic statistics -&gt; 1 Proportion</li>
                    <li>Choose "Summarized data" (which is the case here) and <ul>
                            <li>Next to "Number of trials" enter the sample size</li>
                            <li>Next to "Number of events" enter the number of "successes" in the
                                sample.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Click "Option" and make sure the two-sided test (not equal) is chosen, and
                        check: "Use test....normal distribution". Note that next to "Test
                        proportion" you have 0.5, which is actually not the null value in this
                        example. However, since all we are interested in is the CI we really do not
                        need to change the 0.5 to 0.35.</li>
                    <li>Click OK twice.</li>
