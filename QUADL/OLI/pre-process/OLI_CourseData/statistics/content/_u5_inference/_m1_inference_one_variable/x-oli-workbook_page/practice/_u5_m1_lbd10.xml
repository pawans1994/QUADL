        <title>Hypothesis Testing for the Population Proportion p</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to give you guided practice exploring the effect of
            sample size on the significance of sample results, and help you get a better sense of
            this effect. Another important goal of this activity is to help you understand the
            distinction between statistical significance and practical importance.</p>
        <p>
            <em>Background:</em>
        </p>
        <p>For this activity, we will use example 1. Here is a summary of what we have found:</p>
        <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/image275.gif"
            alt="The entire population
is represented as a large circle, representing products produced by the machine (following
the repair). We are interested in p for this population, which is the proportion of defective
products. H_0: p = .20, H_a: p &lt; .20 . From the population we generate a sample of 400
products, and find that 64 are defective. Our conditions are met, and we find that p-hat
= 64/400 = .16, z = -2, and p-value = .023 . We conclude that H_0 can be rejected."/>
        <p>The results of this study&#8212;64 defective products out of 400&#8212;were statistically
            significant in the sense that they provided enough evidence to conclude that the repair
            indeed reduced the proportion of defective products from 0.20 (the proportion prior to
            the repair). Even though the results&#8212;a sample proportion of defective products of
            0.16&#8212;are statistically significant, it is not clear whether the results indicate
            that the repair was effective enough to meet the company's needs, or, in other words,
            whether these results have a practical importance. If the company expected the repair to
            eliminate defective products almost entirely, then even though statistically, the
            results indicate a significant reduction in the proportion of defective products, this
            reduction has very little practical importance, because the repair was not effective in
            achieving what it was supposed to. To make sure you understand this important
            distinction between statistical significance and practical importance, we will push this
            a bit further.</p>
        <p>Consider the same example, but suppose that when the company examined the 400 randomly
            selected products, they found that 78 of them were defective (instead of 64 in the
            original problem): </p>
        <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/image399.gif"
            alt="A large circle represents
the entire population of products produced by the machine (following the repair). We want to find
p for this population, which is the proportion of defective products. Our two hypotheses are H_0:
p=.20, H_a: p&lt;.20. We create a sample of 400 products (represented by a smaller circle). We find
that 78 are defective, so p-hat = 78/400 = .195"/>

                    <p>From the background we know that there are <code>n=400, x=78</code>, and the
                        null value is <code>p=0.20</code>. Here are the basic commands: </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>To calculate <code>z</code>, enter the following command. (Since the sample
                        proportion is less than <code>p = 0.2</code>, we know that z will be
                        negative, so we take the negative square root.) </p>

        <p>Consider now another variation on the same problem. Assume now that over a period of a
            month following the repair, the company randomly selected 20,000 products, and found
            that 3,900 of them were

            alt="A large circle represents
the entire population of products produced by the machine (following the repair). We want to find
p for this population, which is the proportion of defective products. Our two hypotheses are H_0:
p=.20, H_a: p&lt;.20. We create a sample of 20000 products (represented by a smaller circle). We find
that 3900 are defective, so p-hat = 3900/20000 = .195"/>
        <p>Note that the sample proportion of defective products is the same as before , 0.195,
            which as we established before, does not indicate any practically important reduction in
            the proportion of defective products.</p>
