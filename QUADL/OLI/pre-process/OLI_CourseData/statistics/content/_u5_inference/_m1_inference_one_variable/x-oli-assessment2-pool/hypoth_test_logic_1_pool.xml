                <feedback>Incorrect. Assessment of evidence is not the second step in the process of
                    hypothesis testing. Recall that this step involves determining if you have
                    strong enough evidence to determine if the null hypothesis can be rejected.
                    Before you can evaluate the evidence you need to determine your hypothesis and
                    from where you are going to gather the evidence.</feedback>

                <feedback>Correct. Choosing a sample and collecting data is the second step in the
                    process of hypothesis testing. You identify a sample that is representative of
                    the population and collect data from that sample.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. The conclusion is a summary statement in the process of
                    hypothesis testing and occurs later in the process of hypothesis
                    testing.</feedback>

            <response match="D" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Stating the claims is not the second step in the process of
                    hypothesis testing. You identify claims in the form of the null hypothesis
                    (there is no relationship) and alternative hypothesis (there is a relationship)
                    and these claims guide the entire hypothesis testing process.</feedback>
