                            was that the proportion of planes with contaminated water is 0.035. The

                            statistic for the test was 78.472, with one degree of freedom. The most

                            - 16, which is essentially 0. The alternate hypothesis for our test was
                            that the proportion of planes with contaminated water was greater than

                            have contaminated water. When we calculate p-hat, we get a value of

                            value of 8.858. Using the NORMSDIST function gives a value of 1, which
                            is the probability that p is less than or equal to the test statistic z.
                            Since we want the probability that p is greater than the test statistic,
                            we subtract this value from 1, giving us a p-value of 0.</p>
