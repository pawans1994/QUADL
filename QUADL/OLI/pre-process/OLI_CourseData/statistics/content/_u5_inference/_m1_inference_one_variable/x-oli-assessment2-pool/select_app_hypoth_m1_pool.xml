            <p>In June 2005, a CBS News/NY Times poll asked a random sample of 1,111 U.S. adults the
                following question: "What do you think is the most important problem facing this
                country today?" Roughly 19% of those sampled answered "the war in Iraq" (while the
                rest answered economy/jobs, terrorism, healthcare, etc.). Exactly a year prior to
                this poll, in June of 2004, it was estimated that roughly 1 out of every 4 U.S.
                adults believed (at that time) that the war in Iraq was the most important problem
                facing the country.</p>
            <p>We would like to test whether the 2005 poll provides significant evidence that the
                proportion of U.S. adults who believe that the war in Iraq is the most important
                problem facing the U.S. has decreased since the prior poll.</p>
            <p>Which of the following are the appropriate hypotheses in this case?</p>

            <p>Researchers at Gallup were interested in whether there was a decrease in the
                proportion of nonretirees (in other words, people who are not yet retired) who did
                not believe that the U.S. Social Security program will be able to pay them a
                retirement benefit when they retire. In the summer of 2010, the Gallup poll found
                that 60% of nonretirees thought that Social Security would not be able to pay a
                benefit. Five years later in the summer of 2015, Gallup asked the same question to
                1,282 nonretirees and found that 51% of respondents did not think that Social
                Security would be able to pay a retirement benefit by the time that they retire.</p>
            <p>We would like to test the hypothesis that in 2015 there is a lower proportion of
                nonretirees who do not think that Social Security will be able to pay them a
                benefit. A z-test for the population proportion showed that z = −4.29, p &lt;
                0.001.</p>
