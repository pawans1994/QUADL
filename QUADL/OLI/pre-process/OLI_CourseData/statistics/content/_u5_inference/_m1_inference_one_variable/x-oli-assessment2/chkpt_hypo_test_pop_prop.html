        <body>Does second-hand smoke increase the risk of a low birthweight? A baby is considered
            have low birthweight if he/she weighs less than 5.5 pounds at birth. According to the

            categorized as low birthweight. Suspecting that the national percentage is higher than
            7.8%, researchers randomly select 1200 babies whose mothers had extensive exposure to
            second-hand smoke during pregnancy and find that 10.4% of the sampled babies are
