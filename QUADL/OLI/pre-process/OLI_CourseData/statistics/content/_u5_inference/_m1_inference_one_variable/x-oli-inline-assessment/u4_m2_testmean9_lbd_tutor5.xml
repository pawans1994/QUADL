  <question id="q1">
    <body><p>What would your conclusions be if the dean of students suspected that the mean number of
        alcoholic drinks that students in the college consume in a typical week is <em>lower</em>
        than the mean of U.S. college students in general? In other words, if this were a test of
        the hypotheses:</p>
      <p>H<sub>0</sub>: &#956; = 4.73 drinks per week</p>
      <p>H<sub>a</sub>: &#956; &lt; 4.73 drinks per week</p></body>
    <short_answer id="A"/>
    <part>
      <response input="A" match="*" score="10"/>
      <hint>Consider how a one-sided versus a two-sided test affects the p-value.</hint>
