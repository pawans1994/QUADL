            <p>Does secondhand smoke increase the risk of a low birthweight? A baby is considered
                have low birthweight if he/she weighs less than 5.5 pounds at birth. According to
                the National Center of Health Statistics, about 7.8% of all babies born in the U.S.
                are categorized as low birthweight.</p>
            <p>Suspecting that the national percentage is higher than 7.8%, researchers randomly
                select 1,200 babies whose mothers had extensive exposure to secondhand smoke during
                pregnancy and find that 10.4% of the sampled babies are categorized as low birth
                weight.</p>
            <p>Let p be the proportion of all babies in the United States who are categorized as low
                birth weight. What are the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for this
                research question?</p>

            <p>Does going to a private university increase the chance that a student will graduate
                with student loan debt? A national poll by the Institute for College Access and
                Success showed that in 69% of college graduates from public and nonprofit colleges
                in 2013 had student loan debt.</p>
            <p>A researcher wanted to see if there was a significant increase in the proportion of
                student loan debt for public and nonprofit colleges in 2014. Suppose that the
                researcher surveyed 1500 graduates of public and nonprofit universities and found
                that 71% of graduates had student loan debt in 2014.</p>
            <p>Let p be the proportion of all graduates of public nonprofit universities that
                graduated with student loan debt. What are the appropriate null and alternative
