        <feedback>Incorrect. It is true that in this scenario we are making a
          hypothesis about the proportion of U.S. undergrads who are attending community college,
          but we are making this hypothesis about a specific year. </feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="B">
        <feedback>Incorrect. We do not need to make a hypothesis about the proportion
          of U.S. undergrads attending community college in 2008. We already know it is 46%. Try
          again.</feedback>

            because we can always calculate it. In this scenario, the sample proportion is given. Of
            the 500 U.S. undergrads sampled in 2010, 52% attend community college. Try
            again.</feedback>
