            <p>According to a U.S. news poll, 38% of students in the class of 2013 had done an
                internship during their time as an undergraduate student. Dana is interested in
                finding out whether students at her university had an internship rate that was
                higher than the national average. She decided to ask 100 architecture majors whether
                they had ever done an internship while at their university. She collected the
                responses and calculated that the proportion for her university was 43%.</p>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Her question was about whether students at her entire
                    university had a different internship rate than the national average, but she
                    only asked architecture students so it is <em style="bold">not</em> safe to use

                <feedback>Correct. Her question was about whether students at her entire university
                    had a different internship rate than the national average, but she only asked
                    architecture students. This was not a random sample from the entire population,
                    which would have included a variety of majors. Perhaps architecture majors have
                    a higher rate (or a lower rate) of internships than other majors on
                    campus.</feedback>
