                    <li><p>It should now be clear why this test is commonly known as <em>the z-test
                                for the population proportion</em>. The name comes from the fact
                            that it is based on a test statistic that is a <em>z-score.</em>
                        </p></li>
                    <li><p>Recall fact 1 that we used for constructing the z-test statistic. Here is
                            part of it again:</p>
                        <p> When we take a <em>random</em> sample of size n from a population with
                            population proportion p, the possible values of the sample proportion

                            to satisfy so that we can use this test. These two conditions are:</p>

                        /></li>

                    <li><p>Here we will pause to say more about condition (i.) above, the need for a
                            random sample. In the Probability Unit we discussed sampling plans based
                            on probability (such as a simple random sample, cluster, or stratified
                            sampling) that produce a non-biased sample, which can be safely used in
                            order to make inferences about a population. We noted in the Probability
                            Unit that, in practice, other (non-random) sampling techniques are
                            sometimes used when random sampling is not feasible. It is important
                            though, when these techniques are used, to be aware of the type of bias
                            that they introduce, and thus the limitations of the conclusions that
                            can be drawn from them.</p>
                        <p>For our purpose here, we will focus on one such practice, the situation
                            in which a sample is not really chosen randomly, but in the context of
                            the categorical variable that is being studied, the sample is regarded
                            as random. For example, say that you are interested in the proportion of
                            students at a certain college who suffer from seasonal allergies. For
                            that purpose, the students in a large engineering class could be
                            considered as a random sample, since there is nothing about being in an
                            engineering class that makes you more or less likely to suffer from
                            seasonal allergies. Technically, the engineering class is a convenience
                            sample, but it is treated as a random sample in the context of this
                            categorical variable. On the other hand, if you are interested in the
                            proportion of students in the college who have math anxiety, then the
                            class of engineering students clearly could not be viewed as a random
                            sample, since engineering students probably have a much lower incidence
                            of math anxiety than the college population overall. </p></li>

                            receive a majority vote in the county. The null hypothesis claims that p
                            = 0.50, where p is the proportion of registered voters in the county who
                            say they support the bond measure. </p>

                            year? Which of the following samples could be used to test the null

                <p>In each of the following scenarios, you need to decide whether it is appropriate
                    to use the z-test for the population proportion p, and if not, which condition
                    is violated.</p>
                <p><em>Scenario 1: </em>The UCLA Internet Report (February 2003) estimated that
                    roughly 8.7% of Internet users are extremely concerned about credit card fraud
                    when buying online. Has that figure changed since? To test this, a random sample
                    of 100 Internet users was chosen. When interviewed, 10 said that they were
                    extremely worried about credit card fraud when buying online. Let p be the
                    proportion of all Internet users who are concerned about credit card fraud. </p>
                <wb:inline idref="u4_m2_testprop5_tutor4" purpose="learnbydoing"/>
                <p><em>Scenario 2: </em>The UCLA Internet Report (February 2003) estimated that a
                    proportion of roughly .75 of Internet-using homes are still using dial-up access, but
                    claimed that the use of dial-up is declining. Is that really the case? To
                    examine this, a follow-up study was conducted a year later in which out of a
                    random sample of 1,308 households that had an Internet connection, 804 were
                    connecting using a dial-up modem. Let p be the proportion of all U.S.
                    Internet-using households that have dial-up access. </p>

                <p><em>Scenario 3: </em>According to the UCLA Internet Report (February 2003) the
                    use of the Internet at home is growing steadily. The report estimated that
                    roughly 59.3% of households in the Unites States have Internet access at home.
                    Has that trend continued since the report was released? To study this, a random
                    sample of 1,200 households from a big metropolitan area was chosen, and it was
                    found that 972 had an Internet connection. Let p be the proportion of U.S.
                    households that have Internet access. </p>

                <p><em>Scenario 4: </em>A superintendent of a large school district claims that 80%
                    of elementary school children in her district read at or above grade level
                    (which is much higher than the national figure). To test the superintendent’s
                    claim, a random sample of 40 elementary school children from the school district
                    is chosen, and it found that only 27 of read at or above grade level. Let p be
                    the proportion of all school children in the school district who read at or
                    above grade level.</p>

        <p>Checking that our data satisfy the conditions under which the test can be reliably used
            is a very important part of the hypothesis testing process. So far we haven't explicitly
            included it in the 4-step process of hypothesis testing, but now that we are discussing
            a specific test, you can see how it fits into the process. We are therefore now going to
            amend our 4-step process of hypothesis testing to include this extremely important part
            of the process.</p>
