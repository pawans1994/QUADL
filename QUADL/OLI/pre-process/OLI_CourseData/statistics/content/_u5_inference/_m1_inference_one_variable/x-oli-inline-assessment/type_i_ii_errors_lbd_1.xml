                <feedback>That’s incorrect. If the researchers had made a type I error, they would
                    have rejected the null hypothesis and claimed that there was a significant
                    difference between the group of women who received the hormone therapy and those
                    who did not. Please try again.</feedback>

            <response input="A" name="weaker" match="two" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. With a type II error, researchers fail to reject a null
                    hypothesis that is false. In this study, the researchers have not rejected the
                    null hypothesis. Thus, the researchers have concluded that there is no
                    significant difference in heart disease and breast cancer rates between the two
                    groups. In reality, it is possible that there may have been a significant
                    difference.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Each type of error relates to a specific conclusion from the
                    hypothesis test. We have to reject the null hypothesis to make a type I error.
                    We have to fail to reject the null hypothesis to make a type II error. What
                    conclusion did the researchers make? Based on this conclusion, please try
                    again.</feedback>

            <hint>Remember, you are trying to determine what type of error—type I or type II—the
                researchers could have made based on the data.</hint>

            <hint>A type I error is possible only if we reject the <em style="bold"
