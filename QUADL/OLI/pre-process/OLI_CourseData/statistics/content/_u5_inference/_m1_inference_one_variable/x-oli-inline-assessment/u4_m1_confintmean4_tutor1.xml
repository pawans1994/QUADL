        <body>Suppose the mean hours slept (per day) among a sample of college students was 7.1, and
            a 95% confidence interval for the population mean hours slept was constructed. Which one
            of the following could it be?</body>

            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. The confidence interval must be centered at the sample mean (7.1
                    in our case), and this is the only interval of the three that satisfies this
                    requirement.</feedback>

        <body>Suppose that based on a random sample, a 95% confidence interval for the mean hours
            slept (per day) among graduate students was found to be (6.5, 6.9). What is the margin
            of error of this confidence interval?</body>

            <response match="A">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Because 6.7 is the center of the confidence interval, it must
                    be the sample mean. Recall that the width of the confidence interval is twice
                    the margin of error.</feedback>

            </response>
            <response match="C" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. Because the width of the confidence interval is 0.4 (6.9 - 6.5),
                    the margin of error must be 0.4 / 2 = 0.2.</feedback>

        <body><p>In a recent study, a random sample of “Intro Stats” students taking an introductory
                statistics course were asked about the number of hours they spend each week studying
                for their statistics class. Using the collected data, a 95% confidence interval and
                a 99% confidence interval for the population mean were constructed.</p>

                <feedback>Incorrect: It is true that the 99% confidence interval must be wider than
                    the 95% confidence interval, however since both confidence intervals were
                    constructed using the same data, they must both be centered at the same sample
                    mean. In this case, the 95% confidence interval is centered at 6.1 ((6.8 + 5.4)
                    / 2) and the 99% confidence interval is centered at 6.15 ((7.0 + 5.3) / 2).

                    data, they are both centered at the same sample mean (6.1 in this

                <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that the 99% confidence interval must be wider than the
