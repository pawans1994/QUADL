            <p>A survey of a random sample of 1,500 young Americans found that 87% had earned their
                high school diploma. Based on these results, the 95% confidence interval for the
                proportion of young Americans who have earned their high school diploma is
                (0.853,0.887) What is the margin of error for this confidence interval?</p>
