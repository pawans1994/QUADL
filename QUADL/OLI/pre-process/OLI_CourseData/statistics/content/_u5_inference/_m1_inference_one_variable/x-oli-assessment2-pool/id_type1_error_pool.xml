            <p>Food inspectors inspect samples of food products to see if they are safe. This can be
                thought of as a hypothesis test with the following hypotheses.</p>

                <li>H<sub>0</sub>: The food is safe.</li>
                <li>H<sub>a</sub>: The food is not safe.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Is the following an example of a type I or type II error?</p>
            <p><em style="italic">The sample suggests that the food is not safe, but it actually is

            <p>A 2011 survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 91% of Americans have
                paid leave. In January 2012, a random survey of 1,000 workers showed that 89% had
                paid leave.</p>
            <p>The resulting p-value is 0.0271; thus, the null hypothesis is rejected. It is
                concluded that there has been a decrease in the proportion of people who have paid
                leave from 2011 to January 2012.</p>

            <p>An agriculture company is testing a new product that is designed to make plants grow

            <p>In the 2010 General Social Survey, 17% of Americans said that they had no religious
                preference. In other words, they said they had “no religion” rather than being
                Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, or another religion. In 2014, the General Social
                Survey sampled 2,538 Americans and found that 21% of those surveyed said that they
                had no religious preference. The resulting p-value is 0.0003; thus, the null
                hypothesis is rejected. It is concluded that there has been an increase in the
                proportion of Americans who have no religious preference between 2010 and 2014.</p>
