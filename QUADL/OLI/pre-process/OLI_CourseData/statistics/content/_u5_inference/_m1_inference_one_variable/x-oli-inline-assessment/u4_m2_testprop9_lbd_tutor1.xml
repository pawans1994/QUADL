        <body>Let p be the proportion of contaminated drinking water in airplanes. Write down the
            appropriate null and alternative hypotheses.</body>

                <p>H<sub>0</sub>: p = 0.035</p>
                <p>H<sub>a</sub>: p &gt; 0.035</p>
                <p>As usual, H<sub>0</sub> claims that "nothing special is going on" with the
                    drinking water in airplanes&#8212;the contamination rate is the same as the
                    contamination rate in drinking water in general. H<sub>a</sub> represents what
                    we suspect, or what we want to check. In this case, we want to check whether
                    drinking water on airplanes is more contaminated than drinking water in
                    general.</p>
