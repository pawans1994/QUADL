            <title>Overview</title>
            <body>
                <p>As we mentioned in the introduction to interval estimation, we start by
                    discussing interval estimation for the population mean μ. Here is a quick
                    overview of how we introduce this topic.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn how a 95% confidence interval for the population mean μ is constructed
                        and interpreted.</li>
                    <li>Generalize to confidence intervals with other levels of confidence (for
                        example, what if we want a 99% confidence interval?).</li>
                    <li>Understand more broadly the structure of a confidence interval and the
                        importance of the margin of error.</li>
                    <li>Understand how the precision of interval estimation is affected by the
                        confidence level and sample size.</li>
                    <li>Learn under which conditions we can safely use the methods that are
                        introduced in this section.</li>
                </ul>

                <!--<p>As the introduction mentioned, we'll start our discussion on interval estimation with
            interval estimation for the population mean μ. We'll start by showing how a 95%
            confidence interval is constructed, and later generalize to other levels of confidence.
            We'll also discuss practical issues related to interval estimation.</p>-->
                <p>Recall the IQ example:</p>
            </body>

        <example>

            <p>Suppose that we are interested in studying the IQ levels of students at Smart
                University (SU). In particular (since IQ level is a quantitative variable), we are
                interested in estimating μ, the mean IQ level of all the students at SU.</p>
            <p>We will assume that from past research on IQ scores in different universities, it is
                known that the IQ standard deviation in such populations is <m:math
                    overflow="scroll">
                    <m:mrow>
                        <m:mi mathvariant="normal">σ</m:mi>
                        <m:mo>=</m:mo>
                        <m:mn>15</m:mn>
                    </m:mrow>
                </m:math>. In order to estimate μ , a random sample of 100 SU students was chosen,
                and their (sample) mean IQ level is calculated (let's not assume, for now, that the
                value of this sample mean is 115, as before).</p>

                    alt="A large circle represents
the Population of all Students at SU. We are interested in the variable IQ, and the unknown parameter
is &mu;, the population mean IQ level. In addition, we know that &sigma; = 15. From this population
we create a sample of size n=100, represented by a smaller circle. In this sample, we need to find 
x bar "
                />We will now show the rationale behind constructing a 95% confidence interval for
                the population mean μ.</p>
            <p>* We learned in the "Sampling Distributions" module of probability that according to
                the central limit theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean <m:math

                    </m:mrow>
                </m:math>. In our example, then, (where <m:math overflow="scroll">

                        <m:mi mathvariant="normal">σ</m:mi>

                </m:math>, the sample mean IQ level of 100 randomly chosen students, is
                approximately normal, with mean μ and standard deviation <m:math overflow="scroll">

                </m:math>.</p>
            <p>* Next, we recall and apply the Standard Deviation Rule for the normal distribution,
                and in particular its second part:</p>
            <p> There is a 95% chance that the sample mean we get in our sample falls within 2 * 1.5
                = 3 of μ.</p>

            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/2_iq.png" height="350"
                alt="A distribution curve with
a horizontal axis labeled &quot;X bar.&quot; The curve is centered at X-bar=&mu;, and marked on
the axis is &mu;+3 and &mu;-3. There is a 95% chance that any x-bar will fall between &mu;-3 and
&mu;+3."/>
            <p>* Obviously, if there is a certain distance between the sample mean and the
                population mean, we can describe that distance by starting at either value. So, if
                the sample mean (<m:math overflow="scroll">
                    <m:mrow>
                        <m:mover>
                            <m:mi>x</m:mi>
                            <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
                        </m:mover>
                    </m:mrow>
                </m:math>) falls within a certain distance of the population mean μ, then the
                population mean μ falls within the same distance of the sample mean.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the statement, "There is a 95% <em>chance</em> that the <em>sample</em>
                mean <m:math overflow="scroll">
                    <m:mrow>
                        <m:mover>
                            <m:mi>x</m:mi>
                            <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
                        </m:mover>
                    </m:mrow>
                </m:math> falls within 3 units of μ" can be rephrased as: "We are 95%
                    <em>confident</em> that the <em>population</em> mean μ falls within 3 units of
                    <m:math overflow="scroll">
                    <m:mrow>
                        <m:mover>
                            <m:mi>x</m:mi>
                            <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
                        </m:mover>
                    </m:mrow>
                </m:math>."</p>

            <p>So, if we happen to get a sample mean of <m:math overflow="scroll">
                    <m:mrow>
                        <m:mover>
                            <m:mi>x</m:mi>
                            <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
                        </m:mover>
                        <m:mo>=</m:mo>
                        <m:mn>115</m:mn>
                    </m:mrow>
                </m:math>, then we are 95% sure that μ falls within 3 of 115, or in other words that
                μ is covered by the interval (115 - 3, 115 + 3) = (112,118).</p>
            <p>(On later pages, we will use similar reasoning to develop a general formula for a
                confidence interval.)</p>

            <body>
                <p>Note that the first phrasing is about <m:math overflow="scroll">

                            <m:mover>

                        </m:mrow>
                    </m:math>, which is a random variable; that's why it makes sense to use
                    probability language. But the second phrasing is about μ, which is a parameter,
                    and thus is a "fixed" value that doesn’t change, and that's why we shouldn’t use
                    probability language to discuss it. This point will become clearer after you do
                    the activities on the next page. </p>
