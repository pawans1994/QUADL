<title>3. Finding the p-value of the test</title>
<body>
<p> The p-value &#8212; the probability of getting data (summarized with the test statistic) as
                    extreme as those observed or even more extreme (in the direction of the
                    alternative hypothesis) when H<sub>o</sub> is true &#8212; for the z-test for
                    the population mean is found exactly like the p-value in the z-test for the
                    population proportion. We've already learned that the p-value is found under the
                    null distribution of the test statistic, and since for both means (with σ known)
                    and proportions the null distribution of the test statistic is N(0,1), the
                    p-value is calculated as follows:</p>

<example>
<title>1</title>
<p>In the example about the SAT-M scores of students at Ross College, the test statistic was found
                        to be z = 1. The p-value is therefore P(Z &gt; 1):</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image339.gif" alt="A N(0,1) curve, with a horizontal axis
marked with z-scores of 0 and 1. The area to the right of z-score 1 is the area we care about, because
it is the p-value."/>
    <p>To find the p-value, we can either:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>use the (68% part of the) Standard Deviation Rule for the normal distribution, which
                            tells us that the p-value is approximately 0.16 (since P(-1 &lt; Z &lt;
                            1) = 0.68), or</li>
        <li>use the normal table, or</li>
        <li>carry out the test using statistical software.  In this case, we get a p-value of 0.159.</li>
