        <p>Recall that earlier we noticed (only visually) that for a given value of the test
            statistic z, the p-value of the two-sided test is twice as large as the p-value of the
            one-sided test. We will now further discuss this issue. In particular, we will use our
            example 2 (marijuana users at a certain college) to gain better intuition about this
            fact.</p>
        <p>For illustration purposes, we are actually going to use example 2* (where out of a
                        <em>sample of size 400</em>, 76 were marijuana users). Let's recall example
                    2*, but this time give two versions of it; the original version, and a slightly
                    changed
                    version<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T161006-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    which we'll call example 2**. The differences are highlighted.</p>

                        <em>There are rumors that students at a certain liberal arts college are

        <p>Indeed, in example 2* we suspect from the outset (based on the rumors) that the overall
                    proportion
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T161746-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>p<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T161747-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    of marijuana smokers at the college is <em>higher</em> than the reported
                    national proportion of .157, and therefore the appropriate alternative is

                    <?oxy_insert_end?>.157. In example 2**, as a result of the change of wording
                    (which eliminated the part about the rumors), we simply wonder if p is
                        <em>different</em> (in either direction) from the reported national
                    proportion of .157, and therefore the appropriate alternative is the two-sided

                    results?</p>
        <p>Let's explore that.</p>
        <example>
            <title>2*</title>
            <p>We already carried out the test for this example, and the results are summarized in
                the following figure:</p>
            
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image293.gif" alt="A large circle
represents the population Students at the college. We want to know p about this population, or
what is the population proportion of students using marijuana. The hypotheses are H_0: p = .157
and H_a: p &gt; .157 . We take a sample of 400 students, represented by a smaller circle, and
find that 76 use marijuana. Conditions are met to use our method, so p-hat = 76/400 = .19,
z = 1.81, and p-value = .035 . The p-value is low enough to let us conclude that we can reject
H_0"/>
            <p>The following figure reminds you how the p-value was found (using the test
                statistic):</p>

                H_a: p &ne; 1.57"/>
            <p>II. Since we have the same data as in example 2* (76

            <p>III. Since the calculation of the p-value depends on the type of alternative
                we have, here is where things start to be different. Statistical software tells us that the
                p-value for example 2** is 0.070. Here is a figure that reminds us how the

        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image298.gif" alt="Two 'races' which illustrate why
in the two-sided example we could not eliminate H_0. In the first race, H_0: p = .157, H_a: p &gt; .157 .
This is a one-sided hypothesis, so we get a head start on the race. The data gets us more progress along
the race track, enough that we cross the 'finish-line' (being less than the significance level of .05),
so we have enough evidence to reject H_0. In the two-sided problem where H_0: p = .157, H_a: p &ne; .157,
we do not have a head start, since we are not given the information of which side. So, we only have the
data to give us progress on the race, which isn't enough progress to cross the 'finish-line.'"/>
        <p>We can summarize and say that in general it is harder to reject

                    because the p-value is twice as large. Intuitively, a one-sided alternative
                    gives us a head-start, and on top of that we have the evidence provided by the
                    data. When our alternative is the two-sided test, we get no head-start and all
                    we have are the data, and therefore it is harder to cross the finish line and
                    reject
