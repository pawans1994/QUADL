    <body>

        <p>Here is our final point on this subject:</p>
        <p>When the data provide enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>, we can conclude (depending
            on the alternative hypothesis) that the population proportion is either less than,
            greater than or not equal to the null value <m:math overflow="scroll">
                <m:mrow>
                    <m:msub>
                        <m:mi>p</m:mi>
                        <m:mn>0</m:mn>
                    </m:msub>
                </m:mrow>
            </m:math>. However, we do not get a more informative statement about its actual value.
            It might be of interest, then, to follow the test with a 95% confidence interval that
            will give us more insight into the actual value of p.</p>
        <example>

            <p>In our example 3,</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image277.gif"
                alt="A large circle represents
the population US Adults. We want to know p about this population, which is population proportion
which support the death penalty. The two hypothesis are H_0: p = .64 and H_a: p &ne; .64 . We take
a sample of 1000 US Adults, represented by a smaller circle. We find that 675 are in favor. p-hat =
675/1000 = .675, z = 2.31, and the p-value is .021 , which is small enough to let us reject H_0."/>
            <p>we concluded that the proportion of U.S. adults who support the death penalty for
                convicted murderers has changed since 2003, when it was .64. It is probably of
                interest not only to know that the proportion has changed, but also to estimate what
                it has changed to. We've calculated the 95% confidence interval for p on the
                previous page and found that it is (.645, .705).</p>
            <p>We can combine our conclusions from the test and the confidence interval and say:</p>
            <p>Data provide evidence that the proportion of U.S. adults who support the death
                penalty for convicted murderers has changed since 2003, and we are 95% confident
                that it is now between .645 and .705. (i.e. between 64.5% and 70.5%).</p>
        </example>
        <example>

            <p>Let's look at our example 1 to see how a confidence interval following a test might
                be insightful in a different way.</p>
            <p>Here is a summary of example 1:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image275.gif"
                alt="A large circle represents
the population of products produced by the machine (following the repair). We want to know p about
this population, or what is the proportion of defective products. The two hypotheses are H_0: p =
.20 and H_a: p &lt; .20. We take a sample of 400 products, represented by a smaller circle. We find
that 64 of these are defective. p-hat = 64/400 = .16, and z = -2 and p-value = .023 . Since the p-value is small we
conclude that H_0 can be rejected."/>
            <p>We conclude that as a result of the repair, the proportion of defective products has
                been reduced to below .20 (which was the proportion prior to the repair). It is
                probably of great interest to the company not only to know that the proportion of
                defective has been reduced, but also estimate what it has been reduced to, to get a
                better sense of how effective the repair was. A 95% confidence interval for p in
                this case is:</p>

            <p>We can therefore say that the data provide evidence that the proportion of defective
                products has been reduced, and we are 95% sure that it has been reduced to somewhere
                between 12.9% and 19.7%. This is very useful information, since it tells us that
                even though the results were significant (i.e., the repair reduced the number of
                defective products), the repair might not have been effective enough, if it managed
                to reduce the number of defective products only to the range provided by the
                confidence interval. This, of course, ties back in to the idea of statistical
                significance vs. practical importance that we discussed earlier. Even though the
                results are significant (H<sub>o</sub> was rejected), practically speaking, the
                repair might be considered ineffective.</p>

            <title>Let's summarize</title>
            <body>
                <p>Even though this unit is about the z-test for population proportion, it is loaded
                    with very important ideas that apply to hypothesis testing in general. We've
                    already summarized the details that are specific to the z-test for proportions,
                    so the purpose of this summary is to highlight the general ideas.</p>
                <p>The process of hypothesis testing has four steps:</p>
                
                <ol style="upper-roman">
                    <li>Stating the null and alternative hypotheses (H<sub>o</sub> and
                        H<sub>a</sub>).</li>
                    <li>Obtaining a random sample (or at least one that can be considered random)
                        and collecting data. Using the data: <ol style="upper-alpha">
                            
                            
                            <li>Check that the conditions under which the test can be reliably used
                                are met.</li>
                            <li>Summarize the data using a test statistic.</li>
                            <li><p> The test statistic is a measure of the evidence in the data
                                against H<sub>o</sub>. The larger the test statistic is in
                                magnitude, the more evidence the data present against
                                H<sub>o</sub>.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>Finding the p-value of the test. <ol style="upper-alpha">
                        <li>
                            <p> The p-value is the probability of getting data like those
                                observed (or even more extreme) assuming that the null
                                hypothesis is true, and is calculated using the null
                                distribution of the test statistic. The p-value is a measure of
                                the evidence against H<sub>o</sub>. The smaller the p-value, the
                                more evidence the data present against H<sub>a</sub>.</p>

                <p>Results that are based on a larger sample carry more weight, and therefore <em>as
                        the sample size increases, results become more significant.</em>
                </p>
                <p>Even a very small and practically unimportant effect becomes statistically
                    significant with a large enough sample size. The <em>distinction between
                        statistical significance and practical importance</em> should therefore
                    always be considered.</p>
                <p>For given data, the <em>p-value of the two-sided test is always twice as large as
                        the p-value of the one-sided test</em>. It is therefore harder to reject
                        H<sub>o</sub> in the two-sided case than it is in the one-sided case in the
                    sense that stronger evidence is required. Intuitively, the hunch or information
                    that leads us to use the one-sided test can be regarded as a head-start toward
                    the goal of rejecting H<sub>o</sub>.</p>
                <p><em>Confidence intervals can be used in order to carry out two-sided tests</em>
                    (at the .05 significance level). If the null value is not included in the
                    confidence interval (i.e., is not one of the plausible values for the
                    parameter), we have enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>. Otherwise, we
                    cannot reject H<sub>o</sub>.</p>
                <p>If the results are significant, it might be of interest to <em>follow up the
                        tests with a confidence interval</em> in order to get insight into the
                    actual value of the parameter of interest.</p>
