				<p id="d208907a4a1844f1850d74b0bc84bc5b">The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (IQ test) is constructed so that Full Scale IQ scores follow a normal distribution, with a mean of 100, and a standard deviation of 15. The mayor of Smart Town believes the county’s residents are smarter than the national average and wants to use it (the intelligence of the residents) as a marketing tool to bring industries to the area.</p>
				<p id="b6cc8cac41704b6aa95e741df67299e2">A researcher is hired to conduct a study to determine whether Smart County’s residents have, on average, higher Full Scale IQs than the population. A random sample of 100 people from Smart County were given the IQ test and were found to have an average Full Scale IQ of 105.</p>
				<p id="a69fcc525ced42e79891ff87fa794ee5">After analyzing the data to determine whether the mean Full Scale IQ score of the Smart County residents is higher than the national average, the P-value of .0004 was obtained.</p>
				<p id="fed73bec4e934b868050a148a8698647">Using a .05 significance level, what conclusion can be drawn from the data?</p>
