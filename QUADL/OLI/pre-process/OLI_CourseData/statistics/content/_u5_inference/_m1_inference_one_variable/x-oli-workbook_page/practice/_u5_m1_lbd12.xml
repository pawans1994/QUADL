        <title>Hypothesis Testing for the Population Mean</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to discuss how in some cases exploratory data analysis
            can help you determine whether the conditions that allow us to use the z-test for the
            population mean (μ) are met.</p>
        <p>
            <em>Background:</em> In the Exploratory Data Analysis unit, we stressed that in general,
            it is always a good idea to <em>look at your data</em> (if the actual data are given).
            Moreover, related to our discussion now, looking at the data can be very helpful when
            trying to determine whether you can reliably use the test. In both of our leading
            examples, the data summaries (sample size, sample mean) were given rather than the raw
            data, but in practice, you are often working with the raw data. In example 1, we were
            told the SAT-M scores vary normally in the population, so even though the sample size (n
            = 4) was quite small, we could proceed with the test. In example 2, the sample size was
            large enough (n = 100) for us to proceed with the test even though we do not know
            whether the concentration level varies normally. </p>
        <p>Now imagine the following situation: A health educator at a small college wants to
            determine whether the exercise habits of male students in the college are similar to the
            exercise habits of male college students in general. The educator chooses a random
            sample of 20 male students and records the time they spend exercising in a typical week.
            Do the data provide evidence that the mean time male students in the college spend
            exercising in a typical week differs from the mean time for male college students in
            general (which is 8 hours)? </p>
        <p>
            <em>Comment:</em> Whether σ is known or not is really not relevant to this

            alt="A large circle represents
the entire population of male students in college, for which we wish to find &mu;, the time spent
excercising in a typical week. H_0: mean = 0; H_a: mean is not 8. From the population we generate
a sample, represented by a smaller circle, of n=20. This is our data."/>
        <p>Here is a situation in which we do not have any information about whether the variable of
            interest, "time" (time spent exercising in a typical week) varies normally or not,
                <em>and</em> the sample size (n = 20) is not really large enough for us to be
            certain that the Central Limit Theorem applies. Recall from our discussion on the
            Central Limit Theorem that unless the distribution of "time" is extremely skewed and/or
            has extreme outliers, a sample of size 20 should be fine. However, how can we be sure
            that is, indeed, the case?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If only the data summaries are given, there is really not a lot that can be done.
                You can say something like: "I'll proceed with the test assuming that the
                distribution of the variable "time" is not extremely skewed and does not have
                extreme outliers."</li>
            <li>If the actual data are given, you can make a more informed decision by looking at
                the data using a histogram. Even though the histogram of a sample of size 20 will
                not paint the exact picture of how the variable is distributed in the population, it
                could give a rough idea.</li>

                    <p>To create a histogram in Excel:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>First we need to define the bins that Excel will use to create the
                            histogram. In this case, our minimum data point is 0, and our max is 30
                            (for all four samples). We'll use a bin width of 5, and make bins from 0
                            to 34:</li>
                        <li>In an empty cell type Bin and in the cell to the right type
                            Frequency.</li>
                        <li>In the cell under Bin put the different bins based on the bin width of
                            5. Here the first bin would be 0-4. Continue adding bins by typing 5-9,
                            10-14, 15-19, etc. When finished you should have 7 bins.</li>
                        <li>Next sort the data by first highlighting a column and then selecting
                                <em> sort smallest to largest</em> from the pop-up menu that appears
                            by pressing the <em>Sort and Filter button</em> from the
                                <em>Editing</em> group on the <em>Home</em> tab. Make sure to select
                                <em>Continue with the current selection</em> so Excel does not
                            adjust the other columns.</li>
                        <li>With the data sorted, you can count the number that would fit into each
                            bin and put those counts in the column under Frequency.</li>
                        <li>Now highlight the Bin and Frequency columns. Then navigate to the
                                <em>Insert</em> tab, find the <em>Chart</em> group and click on the
                                <em>insert column</em> button (the picture of an upright bar graph).
                            From there select <em>clustered column</em> under <em>2-D
                            column.</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Histograms shouldn't have spaces between the bars, so right-click on one
                            of the bars and choose <code style="inline">Format Data Series</code>.
                            Then set the gap width to 0% (no gap).</li>

            <em>Comments:</em>
        </p>
        <p>1. It is always a good idea to look at the data and get a sense of their pattern
            regardless of whether you actually need to do it in order to assess whether the
            conditions are met.</p>
        <p>This idea of looking at the data is not only relevant to the z-test, but to tests in
            general. In particular, we'll see that in the case where σ is unknown (which we'll
            discuss next) the conditions that allow us to safely use the test are the same as the
            conditions in this case, so the ideas of this activity directly apply to that case as
            well. Also, as you'll see, in the next module&#8212;inference for
            relationships&#8212;doing exploratory data analysis before inference will be an integral
            part of the process.</p>
