        <p>Let us now go back to the confidence interval for the
            mean, and more specifically, to the question that we posed at the beginning of the previous page:</p>
        <p> Is there a way to increase the precision of the confidence interval (i.e., make it
            narrower) <em style="italic">without</em> compromising on the level of confidence?</p>
        <p>Since the width of the confidence interval is a function of its margin of error, let's
            look closely at the margin of error of the confidence interval for the mean and see how
            it can be reduced:</p>

        <p>Since z* controls the level of confidence, we can rephrase our question above in the
            following way:</p>
        <p> Is there a way to reduce this margin of error other than
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T144748-0500"?>by
            <?oxy_insert_end?>reducing z*?</p>
        <p>If you look closely at the margin of
            error<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T144756-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            you'll see that the answer is yes. We can do that by increasing the sample size n (since it appears in the
            denominator).</p>

        <p>Let's try to understand why <!--is it that -->a larger sample size will reduce the margin of

            mathematically, using probability theory, and intuitively.</p>
        <p>We've already alluded to the mathematical explanation; the margin of error is

                </m:mrow>
            </m:math>, and since n, the sample size, appears in the denominator, increasing n will
            reduce the margin of error.</p>

            that</p>

likely to be closer to &mu; when the sample size is larger."/>

        <p>While it is true that for a given level of

                    increasing the sample size increases the precision of our interval estimation,

                    practice,
                    increasing the sample size is not always possible. Consider a study in which
                    there is a non-negligible cost involved for collecting data from each
                    participant (an expensive medical procedure, for example). If the study has some
                    budgetary constraints, which is usually the case, increasing the sample size
                    from 100 to 400 is just not possible in terms of cost-effectiveness. Another
                    instance in which increasing the sample size is impossible is when a larger
                    sample is simply not
                    available,
                    even if we had the money to afford it. For example, consider a study on the
                    effectiveness of a drug on curing a very rare disease among children. Since the
                    disease is rare, there are a limited number of children who could be
                    participants. This is the reality of statistics. Sometimes theory collides with
                    reality,
                    and you just do the best you can.</p>
