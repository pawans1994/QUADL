                        <p>After reading an article using research done by the Organization for
                                    Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) based in France, a
                                    statistics student decided to conduct his own study to see if
                                    the figures in the article were accurate. This article stated
                                    that 37% of email users said spam has increased in their
                                    personal email accounts and 29% said it has increased in their
                                    work email accounts.</p>

                        <p>To test the first figure, let p be the proportion of email users who feel
                                    that spam has increased in their personal email. The first set
                                    of hypotheses that the student wants to test is then:</p>

                        <p>H<sub>o</sub>: p = .37</p>

                        <p>H<sub>a</sub>: p &#8800; .37</p>

                        <p>Based upon the data collected by this student, a 95% confidence interval
                                    for p was found to be: (.25, .32).</p>

                        <p>For testing the second figure in the report, let p be the proportion of
                                    email users who feel that spam has increased in their work
                                    email. The second set of hypotheses that the students wants to
                                    test, is then:</p>

                        <p>H<sub>o</sub>: p = .29</p>

                        <p>H<sub>a</sub>: p &#8800; .29</p>

                        <p>Based upon the data collected by this student, a 95% confidence interval
                                    for p was found to be: (.273, .304).</p>

                        <p>According to a study completed in 2006 by Pew Internet, 42% of all
                                    Americans had a broadband Internet connection at home. This same
                                    statistics student wanted to see if this percentage is different
                                    for students at his university.</p>

                        <p>H<sub>o</sub>: p = .42</p>

                        <p>H<sub>a</sub>: p &#8800; .42</p>

                        <p>Based upon the data the student collected, a 95% confidence interval for
                                    p was found to be: (.439, .457).</p>

                        <p>According to the same Pew Internet study, 8% of those with broadband
                                    connections are using fixed wireless. Let p be the proportion of
                                    broadband users who use fixed wireless, and consider the
                                    hypotheses:</p>
