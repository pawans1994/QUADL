        <title>Connection between Confidence Intervals and Sampling Distributions</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to help give you a better understanding of the underlying
            reasoning behind the interpretation of confidence intervals. In particular, you will gain a deeper
            understanding of why we say that we are "95% confident that the population mean
            is <em>covered</em> by the interval."</p>

        <p>When the applet loads, you see a normal-shaped distribution, which represents the
            <em>sampling distribution of the mean</em> (<m:math overflow="scroll">

                </m:mrow>
            </m:math>) for random samples of a particular fixed sample size, from a population with
            a fixed standard deviation of σ.</p>
        
        <p>The green line marks the value of the population mean, μ.</p>
        
        
        <p>To begin the simulation, click the <em style="bold">Sample</em> button at the top<!--very top <em>"sample"</em> button at the top most right-->
            of the applet. You will see a line segment appear underneath the distribution; you
            should see that the line segment has a <!--tiny red -->dot in the middle.</p>
        
        <p>You have used the simulation to select a single sample from the population; the applet
            has automatically computed the mean (<m:math overflow="scroll">
                <m:mrow>
                    <m:mover>
                        <m:mi>x</m:mi>
                        <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
                    </m:mover>
                </m:mrow>
            </m:math>) of your sample; your <m:math overflow="scroll">
                <m:mrow>
                    <m:mover>
                        <m:mi>x</m:mi>
                        <m:mo>¯</m:mo>

                </m:mrow>
            </m:math> value is represented by the <!--little red -->dot in the middle of the line segment.
            The line segment represents a confidence interval. Notice that, by default, the applet
            uses a <em>95%</em> confidence interval for μ.</p>

        <p>If your confidence interval <em style="italic">did</em> cover the population mean &#956;,
            then the applet will have recorded 1 "hit," noted at the top of the applet.</p>
        <p>Now, click to select another single sample.</p>

        <p>Notice<!--, under "total" on the right side of the applet,the number of total selected
            samples is tallied [changed to agree w/updated applet ~carol]--> that the total number of samples is tallied near the top of the applet.</p>
        <p>Now, click <em style="bold">Sample 50</em> repeatedly until the applet tallies a
            "total" of around 1,000 samples. You will see that the applet computes the <!--"percent hit"-->percentage of hits
            for all the intervals.</p>
