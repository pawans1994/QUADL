                <p> After the hypotheses have been stated, the next step is to obtain a
                        <em>sample</em> (on which the inference will be based), <em>collect relevant
                        data</em>, and <em>summarize</em> them. </p>
                <p> It is extremely important that our sample is representative of the population
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T212157-0500"?>about<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T212157-0500" content="on"?>
                    which we want to draw conclusions. This is ensured when the sample is chosen at
                        <em>random.</em> Beyond the practical issue of ensuring representativeness,
                    choosing a random sample has theoretical importance
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T212209-0500"?>that<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T212208-0500" content="which"?>
                    we will mention later.</p>
                <p> In the case of hypothesis testing for the population proportion
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T212227-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>p<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T212229-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>,
                    we will collect data on the relevant categorical variable from the individuals
                    in the sample and start by calculating the sample proportion, <m:math

                    p).</p>
                <p> Let's go back to our three examples and add this step to our figures.</p>
                <example>
                    <title>1</title>
                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image221.gif" alt="A large circle represents

&quot;is p still .20 or has it been reduced?&quot; We take a sample of 400 products, represented by
a smaller circle. We find that 64 of these are defective. p-hat = 64/400 = .16"/>
                </example>

                </example>
                <example>
                    <title>3</title>
                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image223.gif" alt="A large circle represents

find that 675 are in favor. p-hat = 675/1000 = .675"/>
                </example>
                <p>As we mentioned earlier without going into details, when we summarize the data in
                    hypothesis testing, we go a step beyond calculating the sample statistic and
                    summarize the data with a <em>test statistic</em>. Every test has a test
                    statistic, which to some degree captures the essence of the test. In fact, the
                    p-value, which so far we have looked upon as "the king" (in the sense that
                    everything is determined by it), is actually determined by (or derived from) the
                    test statistic.

                    about p and what the null hypothesis claims p to be.</p>
                <p>Let's use our examples to understand this:</p>

                    <title>1</title>
                    <p>The parameter of interest is p, the proportion of defective products

                        </m:math>
                    </p>
                    <p>The null hypothesis claims that p = .20</p>
                    <p>The data are therefore .04 (or
                        4<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T212610-0500" content="%"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T212611-0500"?>
                        percentage<?oxy_insert_end?> points) below the null hypothesis with respect
                        to what they each tell us about p.</p>
                    <p>It is hard to evaluate whether this difference of 4% in defective products is
                        enough evidence to say that the repair was
                        effective<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T212633-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        but clearly, the larger the difference, the more evidence it is against the
                        null hypothesis. So if, for example, our sample proportion of defective
                        products had been, say, .10 instead of .16, then I think you

                        <?oxy_insert_end?>would be extremely strong evidence that the repair was

                    hypothesis, which is approximately the same as the difference in example 3 of 3.5 percentage points. However, the difference in example 3 of 3.5 percentage points is based on a
                        <em>sample of size

                    and therefore it is much <em>more impressive</em> than the difference of 3.3 percentage points in
