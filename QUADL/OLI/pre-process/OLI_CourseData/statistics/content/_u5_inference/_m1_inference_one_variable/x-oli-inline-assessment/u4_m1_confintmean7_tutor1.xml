            <p>Below are four different situations in which a confidence interval for μ is called for.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Situation A:</em> In order to estimate μ, the mean annual salary of high-school
                teachers in a certain state, a random sample of 150 teachers was chosen and their
                average salary was found to be $38,450. From past experience, it is known that
                teachers' salaries have a standard deviation of $5,000.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Situation B:</em> A medical researcher wanted to estimate μ, the mean recovery
                time from open-heart surgery for males between the ages of 50 and 60. The researcher
                followed the next 15 male patients in this age group who underwent open-heart
                surgery in his medical institute through their recovery period. (Comment: Even
                though the sample was not strictly random, there is no reason to believe that the
                sample of "the next 15 patients" introduces any bias, so it is as good as a random
                sample). The mean recovery time of the 15 patients was 26 days. From the large body
                of research that was done in this area, it is assumed that recovery times from
                open-heart surgery have a standard deviation of 3 days.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Situation C:</em> In order to estimate μ, the mean score on the quantitative
                reasoning part of the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) of all MBA students, a
                random sample of 1,200 MBA students was chosen, and their scores were recorded. The
                sample mean was found to be 590. It is known that the quantitative reasoning scores
                on the GRE vary normally with a standard deviation of 150.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Situation D:</em> A psychologist wanted to estimate μ, the mean time it takes
                6-year-old children diagnosed with Down's Syndrome to complete a certain cognitive
                task. A random sample of 12 children was chosen and their times were recorded. The
                average time it took the 12 children to complete the task was 7.5 minutes. From past
                experience with similar tasks, the time is known to vary normally with a standard
                deviation of 1.3 minutes.</p>
            <p>In which situation can we not use the confidence interval that we developed?</p></body>

            <response match="A">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The sample was selected randomly. The sample size
                    is much larger than 30 so it does not matter whether or not the salaries are
                    normally distributed. We can use this confidence interval. </feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. Even though the sample was selected in a manner that is not
                    strictly random, no bias is expected. However, the sample size is small enough
                    (less than 30) to require that the recovery times are normally distributed.
                    Since we do not know this, we cannot use this confidence interval.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. The sample was selected randomly. The sample size
                    is much larger than 30 and the scores are normally distributed. We can use this confidence interval.</feedback>

            <response match="D">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The sample was selected randomly. Although the
                    sample size is less than 30, the times vary normally. We can use this confidence
                    interval. </feedback>
