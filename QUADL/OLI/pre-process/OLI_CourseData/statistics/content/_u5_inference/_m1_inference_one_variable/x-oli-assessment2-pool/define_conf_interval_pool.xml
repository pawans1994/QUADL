            <p>Suppose we take repeated random samples of 50 college students from the same
                population and determine a 95% confidence interval for the mean GPA from each
                sample. Which of the following statements is true regarding the confidence
                intervals? Check all that apply.</p>

            <p>A random sample of 160 households is selected to estimate the mean amount spent on
