            <p>A study was conducted to estimate μ, the mean number of weekly hours that U.S.
                adults use computers at home. Suppose a random sample of 81 U.S. adults gives a mean
                weekly computer usage time of 8.5 hours and that from prior studies, the population
                standard deviation is assumed to be σ = 3.6 hours.</p>
            <p>Based on this information, what would be the point estimate for μ?</p>

            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. 81 represents the size of the sample, not the point estimate
                    for μ, the population mean.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. The point estimate for the population mean μ is the sample mean,
                    x̄. In this case, to estimate the mean number of weekly hours of
                    home-computer use among the population of U.S. adults, we used the sample mean
                    obtained from the sample, therefore x̄ = 8.5.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. 3.6 is the assumed population standard deviation, not the point
                    estimate for μ, the population mean.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="D" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. It appears you divided the sample mean by the population
                    standard deviation. This is not the point estimate for μ, the population
                    mean.</feedback>

            <p>A study was conducted to estimate μ, the mean commute distance that all employed
                U.S. adults travel to work. Suppose a random sample of 49 employed U.S. adults gives
                a mean commute distance of 22 miles and that from prior studies, the population
                standard deviation is assumed to be σ = 8.4 miles.</p>
            <p>Based on this information, what would be the point estimate for μ?</p>

                    estimate.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. 22 is x̄, the sample mean commute distance which is the
                    point estimator of μ, the population mean commute distance.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. 8.4 is the population standard deviation and is not an
                    estimator of the population mean, μ.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="D" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. It appears you divided the population standard deviation by the
                    square root of the sample size. This is the standard error of the sample mean
                    and not the point estimator of the population mean, μ.</feedback>
