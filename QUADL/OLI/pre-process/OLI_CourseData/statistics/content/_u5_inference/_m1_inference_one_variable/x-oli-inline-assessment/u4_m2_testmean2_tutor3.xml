        <body>
            <p>The sample size is 25. Using the histogram, decide if we should proceed with a
            hypothesis test for the population mean and explain why or why not.</p></body>

            <choice value="A">Yes, the sample size is large enough.</choice>
            <choice value="B">Yes, although the sample size &lt; 30, there are no outliers.</choice>
            <choice value="C">Yes, although the sample size &lt; 30, the distribution is not
                very far from normal in shape, with no outliers.</choice>

                <feedback>Incorrect. When the sample size is less than 30, what else do we need to

                <feedback>Incorrect. Even though the sample size is less than 30, we can proceed if
