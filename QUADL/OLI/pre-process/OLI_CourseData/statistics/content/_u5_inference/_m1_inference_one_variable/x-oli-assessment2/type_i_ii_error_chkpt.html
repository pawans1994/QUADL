			<body><p>A manufacturer of rechargeable laptop batteries markets its batteries as
					having, on average, 500 charges. A consumer group decides to test this claim by
					assessing the number of times 30 of their laptop batteries can be recharged and
					finds the average is 497, with a standard deviation of 10. The resulting p-value
					is .1111; thus, the null hypothesis is not rejected. The consumer group
					concludes that the manufacturer’s claim that its laptop batteries can be
					recharged, on average, 500 times is accurate.</p>
