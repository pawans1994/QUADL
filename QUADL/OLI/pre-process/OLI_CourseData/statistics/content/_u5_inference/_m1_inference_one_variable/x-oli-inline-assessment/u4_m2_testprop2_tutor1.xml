    <body>The null hypothesis in this case is: </body>

      <response match="A">
        <feedback>Incorrect. p is a proportion, and therefore 8.7% needs to be
          converted to a proportion. </feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="B" score="10">
        <feedback>Correct. Indeed, the null hypothesis represents the claim that there is "no
            change." In this case, the null hypothesis claims that the proportion of Internet users
            who are extremely concerned about credit card fraud has not changed since the report
            (when it was 0.087).</feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="C">
        <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that the null hypothesis has the form H<sub>0</sub>: p =
              p<sub>0</sub>. The mistake in the answer you chose is that 10/100 = 0.10 is the sample
            proportion, p-hat, and not the null value, p<sub>0</sub>. Read the problem description
            carefully, and try again.</feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="D">
        <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that the null hypothesis always has the form H<sub>0</sub>: p =
              p<sub>0</sub>.</feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="E">
        <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that the null hypothesis always has the form H<sub>0</sub>: p =
              p<sub>0</sub>.</feedback>

    <body>The alternative hypothesis in this case is:</body>
    <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
      <choice value="A">H<sub>a</sub>: p &gt; 0.087</choice>
      <choice value="B">H<sub>a</sub>: p &lt; 0.087</choice>

    </multiple_choice>
    <part>
      <response match="A">
        <feedback>Incorrect. Note that we want to test whether the proportion of Internet users who
            are concerned about credit fraud has changed since the report. Try again.</feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="B">
        <feedback>Incorrect. Note that we want to test whether the proportion of Internet users who
            are concerned about credit fraud has changed since the report. Try again.</feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="C" score="10">
        <feedback>Correct. We want to test whether the proportion of Internet users who are
            concerned about credit fraud has changed since the report. The alternative hypothesis,
            therefore, in this case, is the two-sided alternative H<sub>a</sub>: p &#8800;
            0.087.</feedback>
      </response>
      <response match="D">
        <feedback>Incorrect. This is the null hypothesis. The alternative has one of the following
            forms: H<sub>a</sub> : p {&lt; &gt; &#8800;} p<sub>0</sub>. Note that we want to test
            whether the proportion of Internet users who are concerned about credit fraud has
            changed since the report. Try again.</feedback>
