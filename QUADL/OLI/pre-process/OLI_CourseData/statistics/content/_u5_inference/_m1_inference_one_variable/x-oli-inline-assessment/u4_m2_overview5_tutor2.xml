                <explanation>The p-value of the test is .016, which means that it is very unlikely
                    (probability of .016) that we will observe data like

                    observed if indeed smoking does not increase the risk of low birth weight
                        (H<sub>o</sub> is true). In particular, since the p-value is less than .05,
                    we conclude that the data provide enough evidence to conclude that the
                    proportion of low birth weight babies born to mothers who smoked during their
                    pregnancy is higher than the overall proportion of low birth
