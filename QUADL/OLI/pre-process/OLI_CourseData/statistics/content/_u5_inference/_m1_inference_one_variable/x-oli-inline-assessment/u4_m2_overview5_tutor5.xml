                        Recall that in hypothesis testing we can

                        conclude that we accept H<sub>o</sub> (or that H<sub>o</sub> is true). All
                        we can say (in case we do not get a small p-value) is that we do not have
                        enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>.</p>
                    <p>In particular in this case we found that 10.2% of the 175 newborns were at
                        low birth weight (which is higher than 7.8%, the overall proportion). While
                        this result did not provide enough evidence to conclude that second-hand
                        smoking increases the risk of low lightweight, it definitely does not
                        provide evidence that it
                        doesn't<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T165201-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T165200-0500" content="!"?>
                        (which is what H<sub>o</sub> claims).</p>
