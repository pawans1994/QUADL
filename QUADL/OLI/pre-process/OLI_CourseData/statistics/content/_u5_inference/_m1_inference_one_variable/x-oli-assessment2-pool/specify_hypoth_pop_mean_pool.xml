            <p>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (IQ test) is constructed so that Full Scale IQ
                scores follow a normal distribution, with a mean of 100, and a standard deviation of
                15. The mayor of Smart Town believes the county’s residents are smarter than the
                national average and wants to use it (the intelligence of the residents) as a
                marketing tool to bring industries to the area.</p>
            <p>A researcher is hired to conduct a study to determine whether Smart County’s
                residents have, on average, higher Full Scale IQs than the population. A random
                sample of 100 people from Smart County were given the IQ test and were found to have
                an average Full Scale IQ of 105.</p>
            <p>What are the null and alternative hypotheses?</p>

            <p>The dean of the engineering school at a technical university wants to emphasize the
                importance of having students who are gifted at reading and writing as well as math.
                She wants to know if she can accurately claim that graduate students in engineering
                programs at her school have significantly higher scores on the verbal reasoning
                section of the GRE (a standardized test used in the admissions process for many
                graduate programs) than the national average for engineering students. The national
                average for the verbal reasoning GRE score for engineering students was 150 with a
                standard deviation of 9. A random sample of 49 engineering graduate students at her
                school were found to have an average verbal reasoning GRE score of 153.</p>
