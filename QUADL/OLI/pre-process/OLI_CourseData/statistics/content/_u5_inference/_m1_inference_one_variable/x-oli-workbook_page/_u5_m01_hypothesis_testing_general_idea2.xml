<p>A certain prescription allergy medicine is supposed to contain an average of 245 parts per
                                                  million (ppm) of a certain chemical.
                                                  <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T131157-0500" comment="please see comment below on &quot;mean&quot;"?>If
                                                  the concentration is higher than 245 ppm, the drug
                                                  will likely cause unpleasant side effects, and if
                                                  the concentration is below 245 ppm, the drug may
                                                  be ineffective.<?oxy_comment_end?> The
                                                  manufacturer wants to check whether the mean
                                                  concentration in a large shipment is the required
                                                  245 ppm or not. To this end, a random sample of 64
                                                  portions from the large shipment is tested, and it
                                                  is found that the sample mean concentration is 250
                                                  ppm with a sample standard deviation of 12 ppm.
                                                  Let's analyze this example according to the four
                                                  steps of hypotheses testing we outlined on the
                                                  previous page:</p>

Or, specify that the drug has not yet been formed into pills (or whatever), and that all portions of the shipment will be uniformly mixed before that happens."?>mean<?oxy_comment_end?>
                                                  concentration in the shipment is the required 245
                                                  ppm.</p></li>
<li><p>
                                                  <em>Claim 2:</em> The mean concentration in the
                                                  shipment is not the required 245 ppm.</p></li></ul>
<p> Note that again, claim 1 basically says: "There is nothing unusual about this shipment, the mean
                                                  concentration is the required 245 ppm." This claim
                                                  is challenged by the manufacturer, who wants to
                                                  check whether that is, indeed, the case or
                                                  not.</p></li>

                                                  evidence to reject claim 1 and conclude that the

                                                  the required 245? In other words, do the data
                                                  provide strong enough evidence to reject claim
                                                  1?</p></li>
<li><p>
                                                  <em>Assessing the evidence:</em></p> <p>In order to
                                                  assess whether the data provide strong enough
                                                  evidence against claim 1, we need to ask ourselves
                                                  the following question: If the mean concentration
                                                  in the whole shipment were really the required 245
                                                  ppm (i.e., if claim 1 were true), how surprising
                                                  would it be to observe a sample of 64 portions
                                                  where the sample mean concentration is off by 5
                                                  ppm or more (as we did)? It turns out that it
                                                  would be extremely unlikely to get such a result
                                                  if the mean concentration were really the required
                                                  245. There is only a probability of .0007 (i.e., 7
                                                  in 10,000) of that happening. (Do not worry about
                                                  how this was calculated at this point.)</p></li>
<li><p>
                                                  <em>Making conclusions:</em>
                                                  </p>
<p> Here, it is pretty clear that a sample like the one we observed is extremely rare (or extremely
                unlikely) if the mean concentration in the shipment were really the required 245
                ppm. The fact that we
                    <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T132054-0500" comment="use italics instead of bold for emphasis"?><em>did</em><?oxy_comment_end?>
                observe such a sample therefore provides strong evidence against claim 1, so we
                reject it and conclude with very little doubt that the mean concentration in the
                shipment is not the required 245 ppm.</p></li></ol>

<p>Do you think that you're getting it? Let's make sure, and look at another example.</p>
<example>
<title>3</title>
<p>Is there a relationship between gender and combined scores (Math + Verbal) on the SAT exam? </p>
<p>Following a report on the College Board website, which showed that in 2003, males scored
                                                  generally higher than females on the SAT exam
                                                  (http://<?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T132248-0500" comment="this address is no longer valid. please replace with updated link"?>www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/cbsenior/yr2003/pdf/2003CBSVM.pdf<?oxy_comment_end?>),
                                                  an educational researcher wanted to check whether
                                                  this was also the case in her school district. The
                                                  researcher chose random samples of 150 males and
                                                  150 females from her school district, collected
                                                  data on their SAT performance and found the
                                                  following:</p>
    <table><title>Males</title><tr><th>n</th><th>mean</th><th>standard deviation</th></tr>
    <tr><td>150</td><td>1025</td><td>212</td></tr></table>
    <table><title>Females</title><tr><th>n</th><th>mean</th><th>standard deviation</th></tr>
        <tr><td>150</td><td>1010</td><td>206</td></tr></table>
 <p>Again, let's see how the process of hypothesis testing works for this example:</p>
<ol><li><p> <em>Stating the claims:</em>
</p>
                <ul style="none"><li>
<p> <em>Claim 1:</em> Performance on the SAT is not related to gender (males and females score the same).</p></li>
<li><p>
                                                  <em>Claim 2:</em> Performance on the SAT is
                                                  related to gender - males score higher.</p></li></ul>
<p> Note that again, claim 1 basically says: "There is nothing going on between the variables SAT
                                                  and gender." Claim 2 represents what the
                                                  researcher wants to check, or suspects might
                                                  actually be the case.</p></li>
<li><p> <em>Choosing a sample and collecting data:</em> </p><p>Data were collected and summarized as given above.</p>
<p> Is the fact that the sample mean score of males (1,025) is higher than the sample mean score of
                                                  females (1,010) by 15 points strong enough
                                                  information to reject claim 1 and conclude that in
                                                  this researcher's school district, males score
                                                  higher on the SAT than females?</p></li>
<li><p>
                                                  <em>Assessment of evidence:</em></p><p> In order to
                                                  assess whether the data provide strong enough
                                                  evidence against claim 1, we need to ask
                                                  ourselves: If SAT scores are in fact not related
                                                  to gender (claim 1 is true), how likely is it to
                                                  get data like the data we observed, in which  the
                                                  difference between the males' average and females'
                                                  average score is as high as 15 points or higher?
                                                  It turns out that the probability of observing
                                                  such a sample result if SAT score is not related
                                                  to gender is approximately .29 (Again, do not
                                                  worry about how this was calculated at this
                                                  point).</p></li>
<li><p>
                                                  <em>Conclusion:</em></p><p> Here, we have an example
                                                  where observing a sample like the one we observed
                                                  is definitely not surprising (roughly 30% chance)
                                                  if claim 1 were true (i.e., if indeed there is no
                                                  difference in SAT scores between males and
                                                  females). We therefore conclude that our data does
                                                  not provide enough evidence for rejecting claim
                                                  1.</p></li></ol>

<p>Go back and read the conclusion sections of the three examples, and pay attention to the wording. Note that there are two type of conclusions:</p>
<ul style="none"><li><p>"The data provide enough evidence to reject claim 1 and accept claim 2"; or</p></li>
<li><p>"The data do not provide enough evidence to reject claim 1."</p></li></ul>
<p>In particular, note that in the second type of conclusion <em>we did not say:</em> "<em style="highlight">I accept claim 1</em>," but only

<p>Hopefully by now, you understand the logic behind the statistical hypothesis testing process. Here is a summary:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image205.gif" alt="A flow chart describing the process. First, we
state Claim 1 and Claim 2. Claim 1 says &quot;nothing special is going on&quot; and is challenged by
claim 2. Second, we collect relevant data and summarize it. Third, we assess how surprising it
woudl be to observe data like that observed if Claim 1 is true. Fourth, we draw conclusions
in context."/>

                <p>For many years "working full-time" has meant 40 hours per week. Nowadays it seems
                                                  that corporate employers expect their employees to
                                                  work more than this amount. A researcher decides
                                                  to investigate this hypothesis. </p>

                                                  corporate employees work per week is more than 40
                                                  hours. </p></li></ul>
                <p> To substantiate his claim, the researcher randomly selects 250 corporate
                                                  employees and finds that they work an average of
                                                  47 hours per week with a standard deviation of 3.2

            <p>According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), roughly 21.5% of all high-school
                                                  seniors in the United States. have used marijuana.
                                                  (Comments: The data were collected in 2002. The
                                                  figure represents those who smoked during the
                                                  month prior to the survey, so the actual figure
                                                  might be higher). A sociologist suspects that the
                                                  rate among African-American high school seniors is
                                                  lower, and wants to check that. In this case,
                                                  then,</p>

                <p>The most commonly accepted tradition is that college students will study 2 hours
                                                  outside of class for every hour in class. This
                                                  means 30 hours/week for a full-time student taking
                                                  15 units (hours of class). An educator suspects
                                                  that this figure is different now than in the
                                                  past. </p>
