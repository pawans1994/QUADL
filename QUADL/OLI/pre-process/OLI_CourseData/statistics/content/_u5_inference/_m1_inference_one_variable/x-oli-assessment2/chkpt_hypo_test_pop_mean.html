        <body><p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a U.S. government agency that regulates
                (you guessed it) food and drugs for consumer safety. One thing the FDA regulates is
                the allowable insect parts in various foods. You may be surprised to know that much
                of the processed food we eat contains insect parts. An example is flour. When wheat
                is ground into flour, insects that were in the wheat are ground up as well. The mean
                number of insect parts allowed in 100 grams (about 3 ounces) of wheat flour is 75.
                If the FDA finds more than this number, they conduct further tests to determine if
                the flour is too contaminated by insect parts to be fit for human
                consumption.</p><p>The FDA takes a random sample of 35 bags of flour for evaluation
                and finds that they contain an average of 80 insect parts per 100 grams, with a
                standard deviation of 6.3. </p><p>What hypothesis test should be used to determine

                marketing tool to bring industries to the area. A researcher is hired to conduct a

                Scale IQs than the population. A random sample of 100 people from Smart County were

                <feedback>That&#8242;s not quite right. It looks like the sample mean was subtracted from
                    the population mean. The correct test statistic is: (105 - 100) / (15/squareroot
                    100) or (105-100)/(15/10) = 5/1.5 or 3.33. Thus, C is the correct
                    answer.</feedback>

        <body>After analyzing the data to determine whether the mean Full Scale IQ score of the
            Smart County residents is higher than the national average, the P-value of .0004 was
