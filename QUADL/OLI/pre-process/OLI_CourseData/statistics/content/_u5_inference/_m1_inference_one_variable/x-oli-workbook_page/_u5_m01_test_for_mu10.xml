<!--        <p>For comparison purposes, we use a modified version of the two problems we used in
            the previous case. We first introduce the modified versions and explain the
            changes.</p>
        <example>
            <title>1</title>
            <p>The SAT is constructed so that scores have a national average of 500. The
                distribution is close to normal. The dean of students of Ross College suspects that
                in recent years the college attracts students who are more quantitatively inclined.
                A random sample of 4 students
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T090718-0500" content="from a recent "?>entering
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T090730-0500" content="class at "?>Ross
                college had an average math SAT (SAT-M) score of 550, and a sample standard
                deviation of 100. Does this provide enough evidence for the dean to conclude that
                the mean SAT-M of all Ross College students is higher than the national mean of
                500?</p>
            <p>Here is a figure that represents this example where the changes are marked in
                blue:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image372.gif" alt="A large circle represents
all of the Students at Ross College. We are interested in finding &mu;, or the mean of the SAT-M
scores, which has a normal distribution. The question we need to answer is &quot;is the mean SAT-M
500 (national mean) or is it higher?&quot; We take a sample from the population of size n = 4,
represented by a smaller circle. For this sample, x-bar = 550, and S = 100."/>
            <p>Note that the problem was changed so that the population standard deviation (which
                was assumed to be 100 before) is now unknown, and instead we assume that the sample
                of 4 students produced a sample mean of 550 (no change) and a sample standard
                deviation of s=100. (Sample standard deviations are never such nice rounded numbers,
                but for <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T090922-0500"?>the
                sake of <?oxy_insert_end?>comparison
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T090928-0500" content="sake "?>we
                left it as 100.) Note that due to the changes, the z-test for the population mean is
                no longer appropriate, and we need to use the t-test.</p>
        </example>
        <example>
            <title>2</title>
            <p>A certain prescription medicine is supposed to contain an average of 250 parts per
                million (ppm) of a certain chemical. If the concentration is higher than this, the
                drug may cause harmful side effects; if it is lower, the drug may be ineffective.
                The manufacturer runs a check to see if the mean concentration in a large shipment
                conforms to the target level of 250 ppm or not. A simple random sample of 100
                portions is tested, and the sample mean concentration is found to be 247 ppm with a
                sample standard deviation of 12 ppm. Again, here is a figure that represents this
                example where the changes are marked in blue:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image373.gif" alt="A large circle represents
the population, which is the shipment. &mu; represents the concentration of the chemical. We need to
answer &quot;is the mean concentration the required 250ppm or not?&quot; Selected from the population is a 
sample of size n=100, represented by a smaller circle. x-bar for this sample is 247 and S=12."/>
            <p>The changes are similar to example 1: we no longer assume that the population
                standard deviation is known, and instead
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091027-0500"?>use
                <?oxy_insert_end?>the sample standard deviation
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091032-0500"?>of<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091032-0500" content="is"?>
                12. Again, the problem was thus changed from a z-test problem to a t-test
                problem.</p>
            <p>However, as we mentioned earlier, due to the large sample size (n<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091044-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>=<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091044-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>100) there should not be much difference whether we use the z-test
                or the t-test. The sample standard deviation,
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091052-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091052-0500" content="S"?>,
                is expected to be close enough to the population standard deviation <m:math

                    <m:mi>σ</m:mi>
                </m:math> . We'll see this as we solve the problem.</p>
        </example>
        <p>Let's carry out the t-test for both
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091107-0500"?>of
            <?oxy_insert_end?>these problems:</p>
        <p>
            <em>Example 1:</em>
        </p>
        <p>1. <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091126-0500"?>There are

        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image374.gif" alt="H_0: &mu; = 500,    H_a: &mu;
&gt; 500"/>
        <p>2. The conditions that allow us to use the t-test are met since:</p>
        <p> (i)
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091141-0500"?>T<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091141-0500" content="t"?>he

        <p> (ii) SAT-M is known to vary normally in the population (which is crucial
            here<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T091154-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            since the sample size is only 4).</p>
        <p> In other words, we are in the following situation:</p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image328.gif" alt="A table which has two columns and two rows,

in the table by cell in &quot;Row, Column: Value&quot; format:
            Variable varies normally in the population, Small sample size: OK (this is the case this example falls in);
            Variable varies normally in the population, Large sample size: OK;
            Variable doesn't vary normally in the population, Small sample size: NOT OK;

                    following a t-test where

                    approximation for the t-test, since we are using software to carry out the
                    t-test anyway, there is not much gain in using the z-test as an approximation
                    instead. We might as well use the more exact t-test regardless of the sample
                    size.</p>
                <p> However, it is always worthwhile knowing what happens behind the scenes.</p>

                    <?oxy_insert_end?>manufactured circuit boards varies unavoidably from board to

                    the average thickness is found to be 9.13 mm, and the standard deviation for the
                    sample is computed to be 1.11 mm. </p>
