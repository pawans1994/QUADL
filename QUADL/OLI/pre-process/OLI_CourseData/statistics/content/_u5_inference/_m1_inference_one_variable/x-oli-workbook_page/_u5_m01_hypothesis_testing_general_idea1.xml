        <p>The purpose of this section is to gradually build your understanding about how statistical
            hypothesis testing works. We start by explaining the general logic behind the process of
            hypothesis testing. Once we are confident that you understand this logic, we will add
            some more details and terminology.</p>

            <title>General Idea and Logic of Hypothesis Testing</title>
            <body>
                <p>To start our discussion about the idea behind statistical hypothesis testing,
                    consider the following example:</p>
                <example>
                    <p>A case of suspected cheating on an exam is brought in front of the
                        disciplinary committee at a certain university.</p>
                    <p>There are <em>two</em> opposing <em>claims</em> in this case:</p>
                    <ul style="none">
                    <li><p>The <em>student's claim:</em> I did not cheat on the exam.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The <em>instructor's claim:</em> The student did cheat on the exam.</p></li></ul>
                    <p>Adhering to the principle
                            <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T125048-0500" comment="remove bold -- no emphasis needed"?><em>"innocent
                            until proven guilty,"</em><?oxy_comment_end?> the committee asks the
                        instructor for <em>evidence</em> to support his claim. The instructor
                        explains that the exam had two versions, and shows the committee members
                        that on three separate exam questions, the student used in his solution
                        numbers that were given in the other version of the exam.</p>
                    <p>The committee members all agree that
                            <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T125224-0500" comment="remove bold -- no emphasis needed"?><em>it
                            would be extremely unlikely to get evidence like that if the student's
                            claim of not cheating had been true.</em><?oxy_comment_end?> In other
                        words, the committee members all agree that the instructor brought forward
                        strong enough evidence to reject the student's claim, and conclude that the
                        student did cheat on the exam.</p>
                </example>
                <p>What does this example have to do with statistics?</p>
                <p>While it is true that this story seems unrelated to statistics, it captures all
                    the elements of hypothesis testing and the logic behind it. Before you read on
                    to understand why, it would be useful to read the example again. Please do so
                    now.</p>
                <p><em>Statistical hypothesis testing</em> is defined as:</p>

                <p>
                    <em>Assessing evidence provided by the data in favor of or against some claim
                        about the population.</em>
                </p>
                <p>Here is how the process of statistical hypothesis testing works:</p>
                <ol><li> We have <em>two claims</em> about what is going on in the population. Let's
                    call them for now <em>claim 1</em> and <em>claim 2</em>. Much like the story
                    above, where the student's claim is challenged by the instructor's claim, claim
                    1 is challenged by claim 2.
                <p> (<em>Comment:</em> as you'll see in the examples that follow, these claims are
                    usually about the value of population parameter(s) or about the existence or
                    nonexistence of a relationship between two variables in the population).</p></li>
                <li> We choose a sample, collect relevant data and summarize them (this is similar
                    to the instructor collecting evidence from the student's exam).</li>
                <li> We figure out how likely it is to observe data like the data we got, had claim
                    1 been true. (Note that the wording "how likely ..." implies that this step
                    requires some kind of probability calculation). In the story, the committee
                    members assessed how likely it is to observe the evidence like that which the
                    instructor provided, had the student's claim of not cheating been true.</li>
                <li> Based on what we found in the previous step, we make our decision:
                <ul>
                    <li>If we find that if claim 1 were true it would be extremely unlikely to
                        observe the data that we observed, then we have strong evidence against
                        claim 1, and we reject it in favor of claim 2.</li>
                    <li>If we find that if claim 1 were true observing the data that we observed is
                        not very unlikely, then we do not have enough evidence against claim 1, and
                        therefore we cannot reject it in favor of claim 2.</li></ul></li>
                </ol>
                <p> In our story, the committee decided that it would be extremely unlikely to find
                    the evidence that the instructor provided had the student's claim of not
                    cheating been true. In other words, the members felt that it is extremely
                    unlikely that it is just a coincidence that the student used the numbers from
                    the other version of the exam on three separate problems. The committee members
                    therefore decided to reject the student's claim and concluded that the student
                    had, indeed, cheated on the exam. (Wouldn't you conclude the same?)</p>
                <p>Hopefully this example helped you understand the logic behind hypothesis testing.
                    To strengthen your understanding of the process of hypothesis testing and the
                    logic behind it, let's look at three statistical examples.</p>
                
                <example>
                    <title>1</title>
                    <p>A recent study estimated that 20% of all college students in the United
                        States smoke. The head of Health Services at Goodheart University suspects
                        that the proportion of smokers may be lower there. In hopes of confirming
                        her claim, the head of Health Services chooses a random sample of 400
                        Goodheart students, and finds that 70 of them are smokers.</p>
                    <p>Let's analyze this example using the 4 steps outlined above:</p>
                    <ol>
                    
                    <li> <p> <em>Stating the claims:</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>There are two claims here:</p>
                        <ul style="none">
                    <li><p> <em>claim 1:</em> The proportion of smokers at Goodheart is .20.</p></li>
                    <li><p> <em>claim 2:</em> The proportion of smokers at Goodheart is less than .20.</p></li></ul>
                    <p>Claim 1 basically says "nothing special goes on in Goodheart University; the
                        proportion of smokers there is no different from the proportion in the
                        entire country." This claim is challenged by the head of Health Services,
                        who suspects that the proportion of smokers at Goodheart is lower.</p></li>
                    <li><p> <em>Choosing a sample and collecting data:</em></p><p>A sample of n = 400 was
                        chosen, and summarizing the data revealed that the sample proportion of
                        smokers is <m:math overflow="scroll">

                    <p> While it is true that .175 is less than .20, it is not clear whether this is
                        strong enough evidence against claim 1. </p></li>
                    <li><p> <em>Assessment of evidence:</em> </p><p>In order to assess whether the data
                        provide strong enough evidence against claim 1, we need to ask ourselves:
                        How surprising is it to get a sample proportion as low as <m:math
                            overflow="scroll">
                            <m:mrow>

                                <m:mo>=</m:mo>
                                <m:mo>.</m:mo>

                            </m:mrow>
                        </m:math> (or lower), assuming claim 1 is true?</p>
                    <p> In other words, we need to find how likely it is that in a random sample of
                        size n = 400 taken from a population where the proportion of smokers is p =
                        .20 we'll get a sample proportion as low as <m:math overflow="scroll">
                            <m:mrow>
                                <m:mover>

                        </m:math> (or lower).</p>
                    <p> It turns out that the probability that we'll get a sample proportion as low
                        as <m:math overflow="scroll">
                            <m:mrow>

                        </m:math> (or lower) in such a sample is roughly .106 (do not worry about
                        how this was calculated at this point).</p></li>
                    <li><p> <em>Conclusion:</em></p>
                    
                    <p> Well, we found that if claim 1 were true there is a probability of .106 of
                        observing data like that observed.</p>
                    <p> Now you have to decide ...</p>
                    <p> Do you think that a probability of .106 makes our data rare enough
                        (surprising enough) under claim 1 so that the fact that we <em>did</em>
                        observe it is enough evidence to reject claim 1?</p>
                    <p> Or do you feel that a probability of .106 means that data like we observed
                        are not very likely when claim 1 is true, but they are not unlikely enough
                        to conclude that getting such data is sufficient evidence to reject claim
                        1.</p>
                    <p> Basically, this is your decision. However, it would be nice to have some
                        kind of guideline about  what is generally considered surprising enough.</p></li></ol>
