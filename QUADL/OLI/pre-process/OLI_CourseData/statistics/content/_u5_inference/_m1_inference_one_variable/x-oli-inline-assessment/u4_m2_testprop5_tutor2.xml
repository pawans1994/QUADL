                <feedback>Correct. Telephone surveys like this are commonly used by reputable
                        polling organizations. This is a form of stratified sampling that controls
                        for regional differences in financial circumstances. If the response rate is
                        good, this sample can be viewed as a random sample that represents the
                        population on this issue. Should we be concerned that the survey will not
                        represent the poorest households without phone service? Studies conducted in
                        2008 by the National Center for Health Statistics concluded that
                        approximately 1.9% of U.S. households have no telephone service. Using phone
                        surveys is the best we can do, short of a full census, to gather information
                        about adults in the United States. </feedback>
