                <response match="A" name="county residents" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. The sample needs to be a subset of the
                        population of interest. Since some residents may be too young to vote or are
                        not registered to vote, this sample will contain people who are not in the
                        population. Carefully reread the definition of the parameter p to identify
                        the population about which we are testing a hypothesis. Try
                        again.</feedback>

                <response match="C" name="registered county residents" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. The population of interest is “registered voters in the
                        county.” Here we are taking a random sample from the population. </feedback>

                <response match="D" name="largest city" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. This is a random sample drawn from a segment
                        of the population of interest. But registered voters in the largest city in
                        the county may not accurately represent the opinions of the county as a
                        whole. Rural voters may vote differently on bond measures than urban voters.
                        The sample must be randomly drawn from the population as a whole.

                <hint>Ideally, the sample is a random sample from the population of interest.
