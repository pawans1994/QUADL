                testing step 4: Making conclusions.</em><?oxy_comment_end?></p>
        <p> Since our conclusion is based on how small the p-value is, or in other words, how
            surprising our data are when H<sub>o</sub> is true, it would be nice to have some kind
            of guideline or cutoff that will help determine how small the p-value must be, or how
            "rare" (unlikely) our data must be when H<sub>o</sub> is true, for us to conclude that
            we have enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>.</p>
        <p> This cutoff exists, and because it is so important, it has a special name. It is called
            the <em>significance level of the test</em> and is usually denoted by the Greek letter
            α. The most commonly used significance level is α = .05 (or 5%). This means that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>if the p-value &lt; α (usually .05), then the data we got is considered to be "rare
                (or surprising) enough" when H<sub>o</sub> is true, and we say that the data provide
                significant evidence against H<sub>o</sub>, so we reject H<sub>o</sub> and accept
                    H<sub>a</sub>.</li>
            <li>if the p-value &gt; α (usually .05), then our data are not considered to be
                "surprising enough" when H<sub>o</sub> is true, and we say that our data do not
                provide enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub> (or, equivalently, that the data do
                not provide enough evidence to accept H<sub>a</sub>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>Important comment about wording.</em></p>
        <p>Another common wording (mostly in scientific journals) is:</p>
        <p> "The results are statistically significant" - when the p-value &lt; α.</p>
        <p> "The results are not statistically significant" - when the p-value &gt; α.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p> Although the significance level provides a good guideline for drawing
                            our conclusions, it should not be treated as an incontrovertible
                            truth<?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T153146-0500" comment="I assume you want to avoid religious references that are not specifically pertinent, however innocuous."?>.<?oxy_comment_end?>
                            There is a lot of room for personal interpretation. What if your p-value
                            is .052? You might want to stick to the rules and say ".052 &gt; .05 and
                            therefore I don't have enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>", but you
                            might decide that .052 is small enough for you to believe that
                                H<sub>o</sub> should be rejected.</p><p> It should be noted that
                            scientific journals do consider .05 to be the cutoff point for which any
                            p-value below the cutoff indicates enough evidence against
                            H<sub>o</sub>, and any p-value above it, <em style="italic">or even
                                equal to it</em>, indicates there is not enough evidence against
                                H<sub>o</sub>.</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <p> It is important to draw your conclusions <em>in context</em>. It is
                                <em>never enough</em> to say: <em style="italic">"p-value = ..., and
                                therefore I have enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub> at the .05
                                significance level."</em>You <em>should always add:</em> "... and
                            conclude that ... (what it means in the context of the problem)".
                        </p></li>
                    <li>
                        <p> Let's go back to the issue of the nature of the two types of conclusions
                            that I can make.</p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Either</em>
                            <em style="italic">I reject H<sub>o</sub> and accept H<sub>a</sub> (when
                                the p-value is smaller than the significance level)</em>
                            <em>or</em>
                            <em style="italic">I cannot reject H<sub>o</sub> (when the p-value is
                                larger than the significance level).</em></p></li>
                </ol>
                <p> As we mentioned earlier, note that the second conclusion does not imply that I
                    accept H<sub>o</sub>, but just that I don't have enough evidence to reject it.
                    Saying (by mistake) "I don't have enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub> so I
                    accept it" indicates that the data provide evidence that H<sub>o</sub> is true,
                    which is <em>not necessarily the case</em>. Consider the following slightly
                    artificial yet effective example:</p>
                <example>
                    <p>An employer claims to subscribe to an "equal opportunity" policy, not hiring
                        men any more often than women for managerial positions. Is this credible?
                        You're not sure, so you want to test the following <em>two hypotheses:</em>
                    </p>
                    <ul style="none">
                        <li><p>
                                <em>H<sub>o</sub>:</em> The proportion of male managers hired is
                                .5</p></li>
                        <li><p>
                                <em>H<sub>a</sub>:</em> The proportion of male managers hired is
                                more than .5</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <em>Data:</em> You choose at random three of the new managers who were hired
                        in the last 5 years and find that all 3 are men.</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Assessing Evidence:</em> If the proportion of male managers hired is
                        really .5 (H<sub>o</sub> is true), then the probability that the random
                        selection of three managers will yield three males is therefore .5 * .5 * .5
                        = .125. This is the p-value.</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Conclusion:</em> Using .05 as the significance level, you conclude that
                        since the p-value = .125 &gt; .05, the fact that the three randomly selected
                        mangers were all males is not enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>. In
                        other words, you do not have enough evidence to reject the employer's claim
                        of subscribing to an equal opportunity policy.</p>
                    <p> However, <em>the data (all three selected are males) definitely does not
                            provide evidence to accept the employer's claim (H<sub>o</sub>).</em>
                    </p>
