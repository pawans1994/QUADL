            <body>Based on the p-value, which of the following conclusions can be made?</body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
                <choice value="A">The data provide significant evidence that the average number of
                    miles driven per year is less than 12,000.</choice>
                <choice value="B">The data do not provide significant evidence that the average
                    number of miles driven per year is less than 12,000.</choice>
                <choice value="C">The data provide significant evidence that the average number of
                    miles driven per year is 12,000.</choice>
                <choice value="D">The data provide significant evidence that the alternative
                    hypothesis is more likely than the null hypothesis.</choice>

                <response match="A">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Note that the p-value is more than 0.05. Please try
                        again.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. Since the p-value is &gt; 0.05, we cannot accept the
                        alternative hypothesis. We could have also stated that we do not reject the
                        null hypothesis (that the data does not provide significant evidence to
                        reject that the average number of miles driven per year is
                        12,000).</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that we never "accept" the null hypothesis; however,
                        we can "not reject" it instead. Please try again.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="D">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. It should be noted that the statement that you chose is
                        actually statistically inaccurate. Note that the number of miles driven per
                        year is a parameter (&#181;), and therefore a fixed, unknown quantity
                        about which we are making inferences. We can talk about the probability that
                        a random variable takes certain value(s), but not that a fixed quantity
                        does. Please try again.</feedback>
