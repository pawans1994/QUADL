        <title>Hypothesis Testing for the Population Proportion p (4 of 13)</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Consider the population of part-time college students. Suppose that 60% of this
            population is female. </p>
        <p>Here is the sampling distribution for the proportion of females in random samples of n
            students. The standard deviation is approximately 0.10. Lines indicate a distance of

        <p>In this series of problems we will investigate how the sample size impacts the test
            statistic. Letâ€™s return to the context of example 3. The population is U.S. adults and
            we are investigating whether the proportion supporting the death penalty is still 0.64
            (as it was in 2003).</p>
        <p>Here is the sampling distribution for the proportion of supporters in random samples of
            25 adults. The standard deviation is approximately 0.10. </p>
        <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/_u5_m1_lbd_20_image2.gif" alt="A normal curve
which is centered at about 0.64 ."/>
        <wb:inline idref="u4_m2_testprop4_lbd_tutor2" purpose="learnbydoing"/>
        <p>If we increase the sample size to 100, the standard deviation decreases to approximately 0.05, as shown.</p>
        <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/_u5_m1_lbd_20_image3.gif" alt="A normal curve
which is also centered at about 0.64, but is much narrower with a lower standard deviation than
in the previous image"/>
