                <feedback>Correct. The problem description does not assume that the
                    population standard deviation is known, and, therefore, the t-test is
                    used.</feedback>

            <response match="B">
                <feedback>Incorrect. 3.214 is the sample standard deviation (s). Read
                    the problem description again. Is the population standard deviation assumed to
                    be known?</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C">
                <feedback>Incorrect. 0.287 is the standard error of the sample mean, (s/√(n) =
                    3.214/√(125) = 0.287). Read the problem description again. Is the population

            <response match="A">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Note that since the p-value is 0.09, at the 0.05
                    significance level, H<sub>0</sub> cannot be rejected. Recall that this means that the null
                    value, 12.5, is a plausible value for the population, and, therefore, must be
                    included in the 95% confidence interval. 12.375 leaves 12.5 out of the
                    confidence interval.</feedback>

            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. Since, based on the p-value, we cannot reject
                        H<sub>0</sub> at the 0.05 significance level, the 95% confidence interval
                    must include 12.5 as a plausible value. Also the sample mean 12.008 is exactly
                    the midpoint between 11.439 (the lower limit of the confidence interval) and
                    12.577, as it should be.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Based on the p-value, we cannot reject H<sub>0</sub> at the 0.05
                    significance level, and, therefore, the confidence interval must include 12.5 as
                    a plausible value. While it is true that 13.439 does create an interval that
                    includes 12.5, it still cannot be the upper limit of the confidence interval,
                    since the sample mean, 12.008, is not the midpoint of the confidence interval
                    (as it should be) in this choice.</feedback>
