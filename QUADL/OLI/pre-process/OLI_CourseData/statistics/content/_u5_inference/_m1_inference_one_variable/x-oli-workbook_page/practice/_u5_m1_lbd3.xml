        <title>Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to learn how to use statistical software for calculating
            confidence intervals for μ (when σ is known). Software is particularly useful when all
            you have are the raw data (no summary has been calculated), which is what you encounter
            in practice. In all the examples and activities we looked at so far, the sample mean is
            given (rather than the whole data set), in which case it will often take you less time
            to calculate the confidence interval by hand than to launch a software program and ask
            it to do the calculation for you.</p>
        <p>
            <em>Background:</em> Some studies suggest that women having their first baby at age 35
            or older are at increased risk of having a baby with a low birth weight. A medical
            researcher wanted to estimate μ, the mean weight of newborns who are the first child for
            women over the age of 35. To this end, the researcher chose a random sample of 125 women
            ages 35 and older who were pregnant with their first child and followed them through the
            pregnancy. The datafile linked below contains the birth weight (in grams) of the 125
            newborns (women pregnant with more than one child were excluded from the study). From
            past research, it is assumed that the weight of newborns has a standard deviation of σ =
            500 grams. We will estimate μ with a 99% confidence interval. </p>
