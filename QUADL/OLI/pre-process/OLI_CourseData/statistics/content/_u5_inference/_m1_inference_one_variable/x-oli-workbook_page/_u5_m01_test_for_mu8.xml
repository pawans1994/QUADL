<p> The p-value of the t-test is found exactly the same way as it is found for the z-test, except
                    that the t distribution is used instead of the <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T004554-0500"?>Z<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T004554-0500" content="z"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T004539-0500"?>

<p>Note that due to the symmetry of the t distribution, for a given value of the test statistic t,
                    the p-value for the two-sided test is twice as large as the p-value of either of
                    the one-sided tests.

<p>As usual, based on the p-value (and some significance level of choice) we assess the significance of results, and draw our conclusions in context.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<p>The main difference between the z-test and the t-test for the population mean is that we use the
                    sample standard deviation
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T004849-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T004849-0500" content="S"?>
                    instead of the unknown population standard deviation σ. As a result, the
                    p-values are calculated under the t distribution instead of under the Z
                    distribution. Since we are using software, this doesn't really impact us
                    practically. However, it is important to understand what is going on behind the
                    scenes, and not just use the software mechanically. This is why we went through
                    the trouble of explaining the t distribution.</p>
<p>We are now ready to look at two examples.</p>
