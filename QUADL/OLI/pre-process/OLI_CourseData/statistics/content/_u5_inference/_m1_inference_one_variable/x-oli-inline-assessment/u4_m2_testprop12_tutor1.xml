                <feedback>Incorrect. Since .087 falls inside the confidence interval
                    (as it does), we are 95% confident that it is a plausible value for p. Try
                    again.</feedback>

            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. Indeed, since .087 falls inside the 95% confidence interval for
                        p, this means that we are 95% confidence that .087 is a plausible value for
                        p. This is equivalent to not being able to reject H<sub>o</sub>: p = .087 at
                        the .05 significance level.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C">
                <feedback>Incorrect. .087 actually falls inside the confidence
                    interval, which means that we are 95% confident that it is one of the plausible
                    values for p. </feedback>
