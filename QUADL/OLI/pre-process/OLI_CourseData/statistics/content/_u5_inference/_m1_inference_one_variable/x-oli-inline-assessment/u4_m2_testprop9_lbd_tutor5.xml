    <body>We calculated a p-value of 0 in this test. Interpret what that means, and draw your
      conclusions.</body>

        <p>A p-value that is so close to 0 tells us that it would be almost impossible to get a
          sample proportion of 12.5% (or larger) of contaminated drinking water had the true
          proportion been 3.5%. In other words, the airline industry cannot claim that this just
          happened to be a "bad" sample that occurred by chance. A p-value that is essentially 0
          tells us that it is highly unlikely that such a sample happened just by chance. Our
          conclusion is therefore that we have
          <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T135542-0500"?>an
          <?oxy_insert_end?>extremely strong reason to reject H<sub>o</sub> and conclude that the
          proportion of contaminated drinking water on airplanes is higher than the proportion in
          general. On a technical level, the p-value is smaller than any significance level that we
          are going to set, so H<sub>o</sub> can be rejected.</p>

          <em>Comment:</em> In the original study, there were 158 randomly chosen airplanes, and in
          20 of them the drinking water was found to be contaminated. As we mentioned, we based the
          context of this activity on these results, and we simply doubled the counts. Instead of
          158 airplanes, we had 316; instead of 20 airplanes with contaminated drinking water, we
          had 40). We did that
          <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T135640-0500"?>because<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T135638-0500" content="since"?>
          technically, otherwise the conditions under which this test can be used would not
          <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T135649-0500"?>have
          <?oxy_insert_end?>been met. Practically, the results of this study are so
          extreme<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101127T135657-0500" content=","?> that
          the fact that not all the conditions were met has no effect on the actual conclusion.</p>
