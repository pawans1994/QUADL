<title>Sample Size Calculations</title>
<body>
<p>As we just learned, for a given level of confidence, the sample size determines the size of the margin of error and thus the width, or precision, of our interval estimation. This process can be reversed.</p>
<p>In situations where a researcher has some flexibility as to the sample size, the researcher can calculate in advance what the sample size is that he/she needs in order to be able to report a confidence interval with a certain level of confidence and a certain margin of error. Let's look at an example.</p>
<example>

<p>Recall the example about <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T150559-0500"?>the
                        <?oxy_insert_end?>SAT-M
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T150602-0500"?>scores
                        <?oxy_insert_end?>of community college students.</p>
<p>An educational researcher is interested in estimating μ, the mean score on the math part of the
                        SAT (SAT-M) of all community college students in his state. To this end, the
                        researcher has chosen a random sample of 650 community college students from
                        his state, and found that their average SAT-M score is 475. Based on a large
                        body of research that was done on the
                        SAT<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T152957-0500" content="s"?>,
                        it is known that the scores roughly follow a normal
                        distribution<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T150629-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>

                        <?oxy_insert_end?>standard deviation <m:math overflow="scroll">

                        or (467,484). For a sample size of n<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T150705-0500"?>
                        <?oxy_insert_end?>=<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T150705-0500"?>
                        <?oxy_insert_end?>650, our margin of error is 8.</p>
<p>Now, let's think about this problem in a slightly different way:</p>
<p>An educational researcher is interested in estimating μ, the mean score on the math part of the SAT (SAT-M) of all community college students in his state with a margin of error of (only) 5, at the 95% confidence level. What is the sample size needed to achieve this? (σ, of course, is still assumed to be 100).</p>
<p>To solve this, we set:</p>

</p>
<p>So, for a sample size of 1,600 community college students, the researcher will be able to
                        estimate μ with a margin of error of 5, at the 95% level. In this example,
                        we can also imagine that the researcher has some flexibility in choosing the
                        sample
                        size<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T150804-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        since there is a minimal cost (if any) involved in recording students' SAT-M
                        scores, and there are many more than 1,600 community college students in
                        each state.</p>
</example>
<p>Rather than take the same steps to isolate n every time we solve such a problem, we may obtain a general expression for the required n for a desired margin of error m and a certain level of confidence.</p>

<p>Clearly, the sample size n must be an integer. In the previous example we got n<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T150907-0500"?>

                    the calculation may give us a non-integer result. In these cases, we should
                    always <em>round up to the next highest integer.</em>
                </p>
<p>Using this "conservative approach," we'll achieve an interval at least as narrow as the one desired.</p>
<example>

<p>IQ scores are known to vary normally with

                            in order to calculate the sample size when planning a study, you needed
                            to know the population standard deviation,
                            <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T151843-0500" comment="clarification OK? (Symbol has not yet been &quot;named&quot; in course"?>sigma<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T151602-0500"?>
                            (σ)<?oxy_insert_end?>.<?oxy_comment_end?> In practice, sigma is usually
                            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T151812-0500"?>not<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T151810-0500" content="never"?>

                            because it is a parameter. (The rare exceptions are certain variables
                            like IQ score or standardized tests that might be constructed to have a
                            particular known sigma.) </p><p>
            Therefore, when researchers wish to compute the required sample size in preparation for a study, they use an <em>estimate</em> of sigma.  Usually, sigma is estimated based on the standard deviation obtained in prior studies.
        </p><p> However, in some cases, there might not be any prior studies on the topic. In such instances, a
                            researcher still needs to get a rough estimate of the standard deviation
                            of the (yet-to-be-measured) variable, in order to determine the required

        <p>An increasing global population requires more food from crops. With
            the world’s farmland limited due to overuse and a warming globe, one solution may come from
            crops that are genetically-engineered to grow in harsh desert soil. </p>
        <p> Suppose that an agricultural researcher has just genetically engineered a brand new type
                            of corn, never before tested, which the researcher hopes will yield a
                            sufficient number of kernels of corn when grown in harsh desert soil. In
                            order to
                            test<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T152204-0500"?>
                            the corn<?oxy_insert_end?>, the researcher will grow a certain number of
                            ears of the new corn in harsh desert soil, and will count and record the
                            number of kernels per ear. </p>
        <p> The researcher needs your statistical help in computing the minimum number of ears of the
            new corn that will be needed to be grown for the study. </p>
        
        <wb:inline idref="u4_m1_confintmean6_tutor2" purpose="learnbydoing"/>
        <p> In the formula for the required number
                            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T152250-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>n<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T152251-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>
                            of ears of corn the researcher needs in the study, you should have seen
                            that we need to know sigma. Remember that the variable of interest is
                            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T152449-0500"?>the
                            <?oxy_insert_end?>number of kernels per ear of corn; so in this case
                            sigma represents the standard deviation of number of kernels (from ear
                            to ear), for the population of all ears of the new genetically
                            engineered corn. </p>
        <p> In this case, sigma (the standard deviation of
            kernels per ear) isn’t known, since the genetically engineered corn is brand new; and
            since the new corn has never been tested, there are no prior studies to use to estimate
            sigma. </p>
        <p> So the researcher can use the ‘range rule of thumb,’ which says that, to a
            rough approximation, sigma is no bigger than range/4, where range = max – min. If you have no
            other estimate for sigma, you can therefore use range/4 as a rough estimate for sigma. </p>
        <p>To use range/4 as a rough estimate for sigma, we need to estimate the range of the number
                            of kernels on an ear of the new experimental corn. An ordinary ear of
                            corn has around 800 kernels. We don’t know how few or how many kernels
                            each ear of the experimental corn will have, but at the very minimum it
                            could have zero (if the new corn didn’t produce any kernels at all); and
                            even if the new corn actually over-produces compared to existing corn
                            (despite being grown in harsh conditions), it certainly isn’t going to
                            overproduce by more than twice (since it’s going to be grown in harsh
                            desert soil), so the maximum number of kernels can’t be larger than
                            1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T152632-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>600. </p>
