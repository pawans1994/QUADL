                <feedback>Incorrect. This is the sample proportion of the <em style="italic">female</em> students who exercise on a regular basis. You are asked to find the point estimate for the proportion of college students (in general) who exercise on a regular basis. How many students are in the sample? How many of them (in total) exercise on a regular basis?</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. This is the sample proportion of students who <em style="italic">do not</em> exercise on a regular basis (798 / 2,540). You want the sample proportion of students who <em style="italic">do</em> exercise on a regular basis.</feedback>

                <feedback>Correct. Of the 2,540 students in the sample, 1,742 exercise on a regular basis, so the sample proportion of students who exercise on a regular basis is 1,742 / 2,540 = 0.69.</feedback>

            <hint>How many students (in total) are in the sample? How many of them exercise on a regular basis? What, then, is the sample proportion of students who exercise on a regular basis?</hint>
