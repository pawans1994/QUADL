  <question id="q1">
    <body><p>What do you think is the minimum number of marijuana users (out of 100 students) that would
        constitute enough evidence to reject H<sub>0</sub> and conclude that p is greater than
        0.157? Use just your intuition. If you needed to decide whether to reject H<sub>0</sub> or
        not based on a sample of size 100 students, how many marijuana users would you need to find
        to convince you that indeed. p is greater than 0.157?</p><p>(There is no right or wrong answer
        here.)</p></body>
    <short_answer id="A"/>
    <part>
      <response input="A" match="*" score="10"/>
      <explanation><p>As the question states, there is no right or wrong answer at this point. Personally, not being a
          big "risk-taker," if I find that 25 out of the 100 are marijuana users, that will convince
          me to reject H<sub>0</sub>. Anything below 25 would not be enough for me.</p>
        <p>To help us answer this question more accurately, lets look at a table that lists various
          sample counts/proportions of users, the corresponding z statistic, and the associated
          p-value. Click <link
            href="javascript:loadImage('../../../../webcontent/inline_assessment/lbd004.gif')"
            >here</link> to see the table. Note that we highlighted in red the result we got in our
          sample&#8212;19 users.</p>
        <p>This is a great opportunity to see how the p-value "works" as a measure of evidence
          against H<sub>0</sub>; the smaller it is the more evidence is "stored" in the data against
            H<sub>0</sub>. Obviously, if finding 19 marijuana users was not enough evidence to
          reject H<sub>0</sub> and conclude that p, the proportion of marijuana users in the college
          is higher than 0.157 (the national figure), then anything below 19 would not be enough
          either, since it provides even less evidence against H<sub>0</sub>. See in the green
          section of the table how this is depicted by the values of the p-value, which get larger
          as the number of marijuana users gets smaller. On the other hand, it is pretty clear that
          the more marijuana users we see in our sample, the more evidence we have to reject
            H<sub>0</sub> and conclude that p &gt; 0.157. Indeed, note that the p-values get
          smaller as the number of marijuana users increases.</p></explanation>
