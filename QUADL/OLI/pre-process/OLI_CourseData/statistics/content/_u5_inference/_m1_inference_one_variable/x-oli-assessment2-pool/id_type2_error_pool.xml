            <p>A manufacturer of rechargeable laptop batteries markets its batteries as having, on
                average, 500 charges. A consumer group decides to test this claim by assessing the
                number of times 30 of their laptop batteries can be recharged and finds the average
                is 497, with a standard deviation of 10.</p>
            <p>The resulting p-value is 0.1111; thus, the null hypothesis is not rejected. The
                consumer group concludes that the manufacturerâ€™s claim that its laptop batteries can
                be recharged, on average, 500 times is accurate.</p>

            <p>A marketing consulting group wants to see whether placing a seasonal cookie product
                on an end cap (the shelf at the end of an aisle at a store) will make a difference
                in sales. The average sales of the seasonal cookie for this region was 650 units. A
                sample of 36 stores that placed the cookie on an end cap showed a sample mean of 671
                units sold with a standard deviation of 81. The resulting p-value is 0.1288; thus,
