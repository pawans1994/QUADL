                <p>Interpret the meaning of the p-value as a probability statement that relates to
                    this scenario.</p>
            </body>
            <short_answer id="A"/>

                <hint>An accurate and precise interpretation of the p-value will include the
                    following ideas stated using specifics from the scenario and Minitab printout:
                    (1) The p-value is a probability. (2) The probability is based on the assumption
                    that H<sub>0</sub> is true. (3) A statement about the test statistic or sample
                    proportion being more extreme than what we observed in the data (use H<sub>a</sub> to
                    be more precise about the meaning of "more extreme"). </hint>
                <hint>Creating graphs from the Minitab info may be helpful. To describe the p-value,
                    describe the values (p-hat or test statistic) in the shaded area. Be sure to
                    note that your description is based on assuming that H<sub>0</sub> is true (that
                    the sampling distribution is centered at p = 0.55).</hint>
                <explanation>
                    <p>Here are several ways you could describe the p-value:</p>
                    <p>This p-value of 0.024 tells us that it is very unlikely to get data like
                        those observed, assuming H<sub>0</sub> is true. (This is the least precise
                        description of the four given here.)</p>
                    <p>The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as large as 1.98
                        or larger, assuming H<sub>0</sub> is true.</p>
                    <p>The p-value is the probability of observing a sample proportion that is 1.98
                        standard deviations or more above p<sub>0</sub> = 0.55, assuming that the
                        true population proportion is 0.55.</p>
                    <p>The p-value is the probability of observing a sample proportion of 0.608 or
                        higher in a random sample of size 293 when the true population proportion is
                        0.55.</p>
                    <p>Check your response to make sure it includes the following elements:</p>
                    <p>(a) The p-value is a probability.</p>
                    <p>(b) The probability is based on the assumption that H<sub>0</sub> is true.</p>
                    <p>(c) A statement about the test statistic or sample proportion being higher than (since H<sub>a</sub> contains "&gt;") 
                        what we observed in the data.</p></explanation>
