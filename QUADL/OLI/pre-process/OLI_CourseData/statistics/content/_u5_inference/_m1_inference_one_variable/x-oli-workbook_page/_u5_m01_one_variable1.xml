        <title>Inference For One Variable</title>
        
    </head>
<body>
        <p>As we mentioned at the end of the introduction, the first part of the inference unit will
            deal with inference for one variable. Recall that in the
            E<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094056-0500"?>xploratory
            <?oxy_insert_end?>D<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094101-0500"?>ata <?oxy_insert_end?>A<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094103-0500"?>nalysis<?oxy_insert_end?>
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094109-0500"?>(EDA)
            <?oxy_insert_end?>unit, when we learned about summarizing the data obtained from one
            variable (in the Examining Distributions module) we distinguished between two cases;
            categorical data and quantitative data.</p>
        <p>We will make a similar distinction here in the inference unit. In the EDA unit, the type
            of variable determined the displays and numerical measures we
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094139-0500"?>used<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094140-0500" content="are using"?>
            to summarize the data. In Inference, the type of variable of interest (categorical or
            quantitative) will determine what population parameter we are going to do inference
            for.</p>
        <p>
            <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094219-0500" comment="use regular bullets, rather than asterisks"?>*<?oxy_comment_end?>
            When the variable of interest is <em>categorical</em>, the population parameter that we
            will infer about is the <em>population proportion (p)</em> associated with that
            variable. For example, if we are interested in studying opinions about the death penalty
            among U.S. adults, and thus our variable of interest is "death penalty (in
            favor/against)," we'll choose a sample of U.S. adults and use the collected data to make
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094302-0500"?>an
            <?oxy_insert_end?>inference about
            p<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094320-0500"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094307-0500" content=" - "?>the
            proportion of
            U<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094323-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?>S<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094324-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?>
            adults who support the death penalty. </p>
        <p> * When the variable of interest is <em>quantitative</em>, the population parameter that
            we infer about is the <em>population mean (μ)</em> associated with that variable. For
            example, if we are interested in studying the annual salaries in the population of
            teachers in a certain state, we'll choose a sample from that population and use the
            collected salary data to
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094410-0500"?>make an
            <?oxy_insert_end?>infer<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T094416-0500"?>ence<?oxy_insert_end?>
            about μ, the mean annual salary of all teachers in that state.</p>
        <!--<p>Unlike the EDA module that dealt with one variable (Examining Distributions) which had
            two sections, one about categorical variables and one about quantitative variables, this
            part of the course will have three sections corresponding to the three forms of statistical
            inference that we introduced earlier: point estimation, interval estimation and
            hypothesis testing. Within each of these three sections we will deal separately with
            inference about the population proportion p (which comes up when the variable of
            interest is categorical) and with inference about the population mean μ(which comes up
            when the variable of interest is quantitative).</p>
        <p>The structure of this module will therefore be:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Point Estimation.</li>
            <li>Interval Estimation: <!-\-:ERROR: Lists cannot be used within a paragraph.-\-><ul>
                    <li>Confidence interval for the population mean μ</li>
                    <li>Confidence interval for the population proportion p.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Hypothesis Testing: <!-\-:ERROR: Lists cannot be used within a paragraph.-\-><ul>
                    <li>Hypothesis testing for the population proportion p.</li>
                    <li>Hypothesis testing for the population mean μ.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>(Note that the order within the section about interval estimation is then reversed in the
            section about hypothesis testing. This is done on purpose for pedagogical reasons.) </p>-->
