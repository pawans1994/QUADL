            <title>More Details and Terminology</title>
            <body>
                <p>Now that we understand the general idea of how statistical hypothesis testing
                    works, let's go back to each of the steps and delve slightly deeper, getting
                    more details and learning some terminology.</p>
                <p><?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T150415-0500" comment="Add bold for organization purposes:

I reccomend adding bold and wording exactly according to the previously listed steps because of the time taken to work through the instruction and exercises between steps. By the time I got to &quot;step 2,&quot; I thought &quot;why is there a &quot;2&quot; here? I had forgotten that we were working through steps outlined earlier."?><em>Hypothesis
                        testing step 1: Stating the claims.</em><?oxy_comment_end?></p>
                <p>In all three examples, our aim is to decide between two opposing points of view,
                    Claim 1 and Claim 2. In hypothesis testing, <em>Claim 1</em> is called the
                        <em>null hypothesis</em> (denoted "<em>H<sub>0</sub></em>"), and <em>Claim
                        2</em> plays the role of the <em>alternative hypothesis</em> (denoted
                            "<em>H<sub>a</sub></em>"). As we saw in the three examples, the null
                    hypothesis suggests nothing special is going on; in other words, there is no
                    change from the status quo, no difference from the traditional state of affairs,
                    no relationship. In contrast, the alternative hypothesis disagrees with this,
                    stating that something is going on, or there is a change from the status quo, or
                    there is a difference from the traditional state of affairs. The alternative
                    hypothesis, H<sub>a</sub>, usually represents what we want to check or what we
                    suspect is really going on.</p>
                <p>Let's go back to our three examples and apply the new notation:</p>
                <p>
                    <em>In example 1:</em>

                            <em>H<sub>a</sub>:</em> The proportion of smokers at Goodheart is less
                            than .20.</p>

                            the required 245 ppm.</p>

                            proportion of U.S. adults age 25 or older who smoke is .22. A researcher
                            suspects that the rate is lower among U.S. adults 25 or older who have a
                            bachelor's degree or higher education level.</p>

                <p><em>Hypothesis testing step 2: Choosing a sample and collecting data</em>.</p>

                <p> This step is pretty obvious. This is what inference is all about. You look at
                    sampled data in order to draw conclusions about the entire population. In the
                    case of hypothesis testing, based on the data, you draw conclusions about
                    whether or not there is enough evidence to reject H<sub>o</sub>.</p>
                <p> There is, however, one detail that we would like to add here. In this step we
                    collect data and <em>summarize</em> it. Go back and look at the second step in
                    our three examples. Note that in order to summarize the data we used simple
                    sample statistics such as the sample proportion (<m:math overflow="scroll">
                        <m:mrow>
                            <m:mover>
                                <m:mi>p</m:mi>
                                <m:mo stretchy="true">ˆ</m:mo>
                            </m:mover>
                        </m:mrow>
                    </m:math>), sample mean (<m:math overflow="scroll">
                        <m:mrow>
                            <m:mover>
                                <m:mi>x</m:mi>
                                <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
                            </m:mover>
                        </m:mrow>
                    </m:math>) and the sample standard deviation (s).</p>
                <p> In practice, you go a step further and use these sample statistics to summarize
                    the data with what's called a <em>test statistic</em>. We are not going to go
                    into any details right now, but we will discuss test statistics when we go
                    through the specific tests.</p>
                <p><em>Hypothesis testing step 3: Assessing the evidence.</em></p>

                <p> As we saw, this is the step where we calculate how likely is it to get data like
                    that observed when H<sub>o</sub> true. In a sense, this is the heart of the
                    process, since we draw our conclusions based on this probability. If this
                    probability is very small (see example 2), then that means that it would be very
                    surprising to get data like that observed if H<sub>0</sub> were true. The fact
                    that we <em>did</em> observe such data is therefore evidence against
                        H<sub>0</sub>, and we should reject it. On the other hand, if this
                    probability is not very small (see example 3) this means that observing data
                    like that observed is not very surprising if H<sub>0</sub> were true, so the
                    fact that we observed such data does not provide evidence against H<sub>o</sub>.
                    This crucial probability, therefore, has a special name. It is called the
                        <em>p-value</em> of the test.</p>
                <p> In our three examples, the p-values were given to you (and you were reassured
                    that you didn't need to worry about how these were derived):</p>
                <ul style="none">
                    <li>
                        <p> Example 1: p-value = .106</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p> Example 2: p-value = .0007</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p> Example 3: p-value = .29</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> Obviously, the smaller the p-value, the more surprising it is to get data like
                    ours when H<sub>0</sub> is true, and therefore, the stronger the evidence the
                    data provide against H<sub>0</sub>. Looking at the three p-values of our three
                    examples, we see that the data that we observed in example 2 provide the
                    strongest evidence against the null hypothesis, followed by example 1, while the
                    data in example 3 provides the least evidence against H<sub>0</sub>.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <section>
                    <title>Comments: </title>
                    <body>
                        <p>Right now we will not go into specific details about p-value
                            calculations, but just mention that since the p-value is the probability
                            of getting <em>data</em> like those observed when H<sub>0</sub> is true,
                            it would make sense that the calculation of the p-value will be based on
                            the data summary, which, as we mentioned, is the test statistic. Indeed,
                            this is the case. In practice, we will mostly use software to provide
                            the p-value for us.</p>

                        <p>It should be noted that in the past, before statistical software was such
                            an integral part of intro stats courses it was common to use critical
                            values (rather than p-values) in order to assess the evidence provided
                            by the data. While this courses focuses on p-values, we will provide
                            some details about the critical values approach later in this module for
                            those students who are interested in learning more about it. </p>
