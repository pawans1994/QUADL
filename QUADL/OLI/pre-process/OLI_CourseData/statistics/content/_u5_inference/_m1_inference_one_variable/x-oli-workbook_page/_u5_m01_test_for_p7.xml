<p>We've just seen that finding p-values involves probability calculations about the value of the
                    test statistic assuming that H<sub>o</sub> is true. In this case, when
                        H<sub>o</sub> is true, the values of the test statistic follow a standard
                    normal distribution (i.e., the sampling distribution of the test statistic when
                    the null hypothesis is true is N(0,1)). Therefore, p-values correspond to areas
                    (probabilities) under the standard normal curve.</p>
<p>Similarly, in <em>any test</em>, p-values are found using the sampling distribution of the test
                    statistic when the null hypothesis is true (also known as the "null
                    distribution" of the test statistic). In this case, it was relatively easy to
                    argue that the null distribution of our test statistic is N(0,1). As we'll see,
                    in other tests, other distributions come up (like the t-distribution and the
                    F-distribution), which we will just mention briefly, and rely heavily on the
                    output of our statistical package for obtaining the p-values.</p>
</body>
</section>
<p>We've just completed our discussion about the p-value, and how it is calculated both in general
            and more specifically for the z-test for the population proportion. Let's go back to the
            four-step process of hypothesis testing and see what we've covered and what still needs
            to be discussed.</p>

<title>The Four Steps in Hypothesis Testing</title>

    <ol>
<li><p>
                    State the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses, H<sub>o</sub>
                    and H<sub>a</sub>.</p></li>
<li><p>
                    Obtain a random sample, collect relevant data, and <em>check whether
                        the data meet the conditions under which the test can be used.</em> If the
                    conditions are met, summarize the data using a test statistic.</p></li>
<li><p>
                    Find the p-value of the test.</p></li>
<li><p>
                    Based on the p-value, decide whether or not the results are
                    significant, and <em>draw your conclusions in context.</em>
                </p></li></ol>

                            “good.” We want to know if the proportion is smaller this year. We
                            gather a random sample of 100 U.S. adults this year and find that 39
                            rate their financial situation as “good.” Use the output from Minitab to

            <p>The trustees of a local school district commission a survey to determine voter
                opinions about a possible bond measure to fund school upgrades. In a poll of 293
                of the district’s 5,019 registered voters, 178 would support the bond measure. A
                hypothesis test was conducted using Minitab to determine if such a bond would
                pass with the required 55% of the vote.</p>
