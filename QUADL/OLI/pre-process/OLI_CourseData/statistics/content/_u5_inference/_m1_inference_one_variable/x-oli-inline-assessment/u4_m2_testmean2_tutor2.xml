    <question id="q1">
      <body><em>Question 1: </em>The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is
        administered annually to 4th, 8th, and 12th graders in the United States. On the math
        assessment, a score above 275 is considered an indication that a student has the skills to
        balance a checkbook. In a random sample of 500 young men between the ages of 18 and 20, the
        mean NAEP math score is 272. Do we have evidence to support the claim that young men
        nationwide have a mean score below 275?</body>

      <body><em>Question 2:</em> The National Center for Health Statistics reports that the systolic
        blood pressure for males 35 to 44 years of age has a mean of 128. In a study of business
        executives, a random sample of 100 executives has a mean systolic blood pressure of 134. Do
        the data suggest that the mean systolic blood pressure for business executives is higher
        than 128?</body>

      <body><em>Question 3: </em>An analytical chemistry lab is conducting quality control tests on
        a drug. A single dosage of the drug should contain 8 mg of active ingredient. Of course,
        there will be a small amount of variability due to imperfections in the production process,
        but the mean of all dosages produced should be 8 mg. In 20 random samples, the mean amount
        of active ingredient is 7.7 mg. Do the data suggest that the mean amount of active
        ingredient in all dosages produced is different from 8 mg?</body>
