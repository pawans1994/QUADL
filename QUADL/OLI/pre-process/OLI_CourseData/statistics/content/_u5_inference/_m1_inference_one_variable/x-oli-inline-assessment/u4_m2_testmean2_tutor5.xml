                    <feedback>Correct. This is a borderline case. The sample size is only 15, so we can’t be sure that the Central Limit Theorem applies. However, the sample is not heavily skewed and there are no outliers, so we will assume that this sample could have come from a population in which the variable is normally distributed. We will use the z-test with caution.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. You are right to say the conditions are not met. However,
                        this is a borderline case, since the sample is not heavily skewed and does
                        not contain outliers. </feedback>
