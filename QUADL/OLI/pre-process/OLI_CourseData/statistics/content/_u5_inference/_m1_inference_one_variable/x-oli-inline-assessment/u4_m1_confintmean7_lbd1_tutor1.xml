                        <p>Thus, we are 99% confident that the mean birth weight of first babies
                            born to mothers who are 35 or older is between 2,996 and 3,227

                        <p>1. Note that in the output, Minitab also calculates the sample standard
                            deviation, s, (under StDev) and another quantity denoted by "SE Mean"
                            (which we will discuss in the course shortly). Even though these
                            quantities are not needed for calculating the confidence interval, it is
                            quite encouraging to see that the sample standard deviation is 501.32,
                            since this means that our assumption of &#x03C3; = 500 is quite
                            reasonable. </p>
                        <p>2. If you go back for a minute to the dialog box (Stat → Basic statistics
                            → 1 Sample Z) you'll notice that there is also the option to give
                            Minitab "Summarized data" instead of the raw data. (i.e., the sample
                            size (n) and mean (x-bar)). As we mentioned earlier in this activity, in
                            cases like these, it would be easier to simply use the formula
                            ourselves, but it is noteworthy that the option in Minitab exists. </p>

                        <p>1. Note that in the output, the TI Calculator also calculates the sample
                            standard deviation, Sx. Even though this quantity is not needed for
                            calculating the confidence interval, it is quite encouraging to see that
                            the sample standard deviation is 501.32, since this means that our
                            assumption of &#x03C3; = 500 is quite reasonable. </p>
                        <p>2. When calculating the confidence interval for the population mean, the TI offers the choice of <em>DATA</em> or <code>STATS</code>. If you choose <code>STATS</code>, you’d see:</p>
