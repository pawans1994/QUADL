            <body><p>A study estimated that the mean number of children per family in the the United
                    States is 1.3. This point estimate would be unbiased and most accurate if it
                    were based on which of the following?</p></body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="false" select="single">
                <choice value="A">A random sample of 10,000 U.S. families with children from the
                    state of Utah</choice>
                <choice value="B">A random sample of 500 U.S. families with children</choice>
                <choice value="C">A random sample of 5,000 U.S. families with children</choice>
                <choice value="D">A random sample of 1,000 U.S. families</choice>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Families in Utah tend to have more than the average number
                        of children, so a point estimate based on this sample would overestimate the
                        true mean despite the very large sample size.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Although it is true that this estimate is based on a random
                        sample (and is therefore unbiased), recall that the larger the sample size,
                        the more accurate the estimate is.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Because the random sample consists of families with
                        children and not families in general (some of which do not have children),
                        the point estimate overestimates the true mean.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="D" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. The estimate is based on a random sample (and is therefore
                        unbiased) and is also based on a large sample, which makes it more
                        accurate.</feedback>
