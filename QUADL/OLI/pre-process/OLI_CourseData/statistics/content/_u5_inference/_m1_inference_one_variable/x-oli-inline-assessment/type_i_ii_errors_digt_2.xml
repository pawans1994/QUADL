        <!-- LO  identify Type II Error in context-->
        <body>
            <p>A researcher looks at the mean salaries of male and female electricians and decides
                based on the evidence that there is no difference between the two groups. The
                researcher could have made a <input_ref input="A"/> in drawing this conclusion. </p>

                <feedback>Incorrect. A type I error would require the researcher to claim that there
                    is a significant difference in mean salaries between male and female
                    electricians, when in reality, there may be no difference in the average
                    salaries. The correct answer is type II error, since the researchers failed to
                    reject the null hypothesis.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response input="A" name="type_ii" match="two" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. It may be a type II error, because the researcher concluded
                    based on the evidence that there is no significant difference in average
                    salaries of men and women electricians, when in reality, there may be a
                    significant difference between groups.</feedback>
