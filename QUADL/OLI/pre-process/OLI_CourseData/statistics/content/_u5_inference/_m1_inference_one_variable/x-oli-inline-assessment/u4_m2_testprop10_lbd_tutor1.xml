Regardless of whether the results are statistically significant or not, comment on the practical implication of the results.</body><short_answer id="A"/><part><response input="A" match="*" score="10"/><explanation>A sample proportion of 0.195 (19.5% defective products) tells us that practically, the repair was ineffective in reducing the proportion of defective products. It is hard to imagine a situation where a company would consider a reduction of 0.5% a practically important reduction in the proportion of defective products.</explanation></part></question></assessment>
