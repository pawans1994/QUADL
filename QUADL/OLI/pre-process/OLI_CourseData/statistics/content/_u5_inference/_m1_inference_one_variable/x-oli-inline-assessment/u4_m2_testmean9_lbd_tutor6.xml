        <p>a. Yes, the t-procedure is still mathematically justified, since the sample size is
          still 75 (and inference is still
          justified<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101128T102456-0500" content=" at all"?>
          because the sample is still random). </p>
        
        <p>b.  No, the resulting conclusion would no longer address the question of interest,
          because the sampling frame (all students in the engineering classes) no longer matches the
          population of interest (all students in the entire college). The inferential conclusion
          from the t-test would only allow us to make conclusions about students <em style="italic">in the engineering
          classes</em> (i.e., about the group from which the sample was randomly selected). Art majors or
          humanities majors, for instance, probably donâ€™t take engineering and therefore would not
          have been represented in the (altered) study. So the conclusions from this (altered) study
          design would not be valid for the college as a whole. </p>
