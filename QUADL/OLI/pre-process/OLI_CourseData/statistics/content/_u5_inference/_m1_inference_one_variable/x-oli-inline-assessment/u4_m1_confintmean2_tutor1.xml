  <question id="q1">
    <body>Based on this study, find a 95% confidence interval for &#956;, the mean pregnancy length
      of women who smoke during their pregnancy, and interpret your interval in context.</body>

        <p>The problem provides the following information:</p>
        <p>&#8226; Our sample size is n = 114</p>
        <p>&#8226; This sample gives a sample mean of</p>
        <image src="../../../webcontent/inline_assessment/_u5_m1_lbdtutor1a_image1.jpg" alt="sample mean = 260"/>
        <p>&#8226; Human pregnancy is known to have a standard deviation of &#x03C3; = 16.</p>
        <p>The 95% confidence interval for &#x03BC; is therefore:</p>
        <image src="../../../webcontent/inline_assessment/_u5_m1_lbdtutor1a_image2.jpg" alt="95% confidence interval = 260 plus or minus 3"/>
        <p>or
            (257,<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T113009-0500" content=" "?>263).</p>
        <p>Interpretation: We are 95% confident that the mean pregnancy
            length<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T113016-0500" content=","?> of
            women who smoke during
            pregnancy<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T113021-0500" content=","?> is
            covered by the interval (257, 263).</p></explanation>
