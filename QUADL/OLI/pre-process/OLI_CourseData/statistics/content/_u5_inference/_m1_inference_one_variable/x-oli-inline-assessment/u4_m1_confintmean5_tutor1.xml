    <question id="q1">
        <body><p>A medical researcher wanted to estimate μ, the mean weight of newborns born to
            women over the age of 40.</p>
            <p>The researcher chose a random sample of 100 pregnant women who were over 40, followed
                them through the pregnancy, and found that the mean weight of the 100 newborns was
                3,035 grams. From past research, it is assumed that the weight of newborns has a
                standard deviation of &#963; = 500. The researcher calculated the 95% confidence
                interval for μ to be (2935, 3135). </p>
            <p>If the researcher wanted to maintain the 95% level of confidence but report a
                confidence interval with a smaller margin of error, which of the following will
                achieve that?</p></body>
        <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
            <choice value="A">Redo the study, but this time with a sample of size 64.</choice>
            <choice value="B">Redo the study, but this time with a sample of size 225.</choice>
            <choice value="C">Redo the study and choose a different sample of size 100.</choice>

            <response match="A">
                <feedback>Incorrect. A smaller sample size will actually achieve the opposite of
                    your desired results. The resulting 95% confidence interval will be wider rather
                    than narrower.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. A larger sample size reduces the margin of error (for a given
                    level of confidence). In particular, by using a sample size of 225 instead of
                    100, the margin of error will be reduced from 100 to roughly 67.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C">
                <feedback>Incorrect. A different sample of size 100 will probably produce a
                    different sample

                    and therefore will be centered at a different number, but will have exactly the
                    same margin of error.</feedback>

    <question id="q2">
        <body><p>The mean score on the quantitative reasoning part of the GRE (Graduate Record
                Examination) of non-U.S. citizens has an unknown mean, , and an assumed standard
                deviation =8. Based on a random sample of non-U.S. citizens who took the GRE in 2014
                the 95% confidence interval for was calculated to be (153.6, 158.6). </p>
            <p>Suppose now that a different random sample of non-U.S. citizens who took the GRE in
                2014 is chosen and that this sample is <em style="bold">larger</em> than the sample that produced the

                <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that when you increase the sample size, the confidence
                    interval gets narrower. This confidence interval is wider (width: 159.2 − 153.4
                    = 5.8) than the confidence interval that is based on the smaller sample size

                <feedback>Incorrect. Recall that when you increase the sample size, the confidence
                    interval gets narrower. This confidence interval has the same width (158.9 −
                    153.9 = 5) as the confidence interval that is based on the smaller sample size

            <response match="C">
                <feedback>Not quite right. You are correct that when the sample size increases, the
                    confidence interval gets narrower and indeed this confidence interval is
                    narrower (width = 4.6) than the confidence interval that is based on the smaller
                    sample size (width = 5). However, the center of this confidence interval, (158.4
                    + 153.8)/2 = 156.1 (which the average score in the larger sample), is identical
                    to the center of the confidence interval that is based on the smaller sample,
                    (153.6 + 158.6)/2 = 156.1 (which the average score in the smaller sample). Due
                    to sampling variability, it is extremely unlikely that two random samples will
                    produce the same average.</feedback>

                <feedback>Correct. When the sample size increases, the confidence interval gets
                    narrower, and this confidence interval is narrower (width = 4.6) than the
                    confidence interval that is based on the smaller sample size (width =
