                        <p>Even though the sample results are similar to what we got before (sample
                            proportion of 0.195), since they are based on a much larger sample
                            (20,000 compared to 400) now they are statistically significant (at the
                            .05 level, since 0.039 is less than 0.05). In this case, we can
                            therefore reject H<sub>o</sub> and conclude that the repair reduced the
                            proportion of defective products to below 0.20. </p>
                        <p>Summary: This is perhaps an "extreme" example, yet it is effective in
                            illustrating the important distinction between practical importance and
                            statistical significance. A reduction of 0.005 (or .5%) in the
                            proportion of defective products probably does not carry any practical
                            importance, however, because of the large sample size, this reduction is
                            statistically significant. In general, with a sufficiently large sample
                            size you can make any result that has very little practical importance
                            statistically significant. This suggests that when interpreting the
                            results of a test, you should always think not only about the
