            <p>In June 2005, a <em style="italic">CBS News/NY Times</em> poll asked a random sample
                of 1,111 U.S. adults the following question: "What do you think is the most
                important problem facing this country today?" Roughly 19% of those sampled answered
                "the war in Iraq" (while the rest answered economy/jobs, terrorism, healthcare,
                etc.). Exactly a year prior to this poll, in June of 2004, it was estimated that
                roughly 1 out of every 4 U.S. adults believed (at that time) that the war in Iraq
                was the most important problem facing the country.</p>
            <p>We would like to test whether the 2005 poll provides significant evidence that the
                proportion of U.S. adults who believe that the war in Iraq is the most important
                problem facing the U.S. has decreased since the prior poll.</p>
            <p>The following output is available for this test: <image style="block" src="../webcontent/assessment8q11image1.gif" /></p>

                <feedback>Correct. A p-value so small (the statistical software reports that it is

            <p>Researchers at Gallup were interested in whether there was a decrease in the

                retirement benefit when they retire. In the summer of 2010, the Gallup poll found
                that 60% of nonretirees thought that Social Security would not be able to pay a
                benefit. Five years later in the summer of 2015, Gallup asked the same question to
                1,282 nonretirees and found that 51% of respondents did not think that Social
                Security would be able to pay a retirement benefit by the time that they retire.</p>

                <feedback>Correct. The p-value of 0.0164 was less than the significance level of
                    0.05, so we do have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. We never accept the null hypothesis, but rather reject or fail

                <feedback>Incorrect. If the p-value were greater than 0.05, we could conclude that
                    the data does not provide enough evidence to reject H<sub>0</sub>. However, the
                    p-value was 0.0164.</feedback>
