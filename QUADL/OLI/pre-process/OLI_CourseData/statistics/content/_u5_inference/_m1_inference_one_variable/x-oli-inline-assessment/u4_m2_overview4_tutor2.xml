                        adults who oppose gay marriage is a parameter (p), and therefore a fixed,

                        inference about. You can talk about the probability that a random variable
                        takes
                        <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155111-0500" content="a "?>certain
                        value(s), but not about the probability or likelihood that a fixed quantity
                        takes
                        <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155119-0500" content="a "?>certain

                </response>
                <hint>Recall that our conclusion is based on how small the p-value is. Here we're
                    using a .05 significance level, which means that if the p-value is less than
                    .05, we would reject the null hypothesis
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155828-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155830-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    and accept the alternative hypothesis
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155835-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>H<sub>a</sub><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155837-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>.</hint>
                <hint>The p-value in this case is .002, which is less than our cutoff of .05. So
                    this means that we reject
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155842-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>H<sub>o</sub><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155844-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    and accept
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155847-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>H<sub>a</sub><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155849-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>.
                    Can you now say what this means in context?</hint>
                <hint>Because of the small p-value, we reject the null hypothesis (opposition to gay
                    marriage is 50%) and accept the alternative (opposition is greater than 50%).
                    Thus, we conclude that majority of
                    U<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155206-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?>S<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101126T155207-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    adults oppose gay marriage.</hint>
