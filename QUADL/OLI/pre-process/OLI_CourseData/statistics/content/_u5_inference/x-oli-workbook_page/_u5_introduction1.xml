<title>Introduction to Inference (1 of 2)</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Recall again the Big Picture, the four-step process that encompasses statistics: data
        production, exploratory data analysis, probability, and inference.</p>
    <p>We are about to start the fourth part of the process and the final section of this course,
            where we draw on principles learned in the other units (exploratory data analysis,
            producing data, and probability) in order to accomplish what has been our ultimate goal
            all along: use a sample to infer (or draw conclusions) about the population from which
            it was drawn. The specific form of inference called
            for depends on the type of variables involved&#8212;either a single categorical or
            quantitative variable, or a combination of two variables whose relationship is of
            interest.</p>

        of Statistics. First, a set of data was created from subset of the population. This is the Producing
        Data step. Then, we perform exploratory data analysis on the data. With these results, we apply
        probability which is our first step in drawing conclusions about the population from the data. After
        we have applied probability to the data, we can draw conclusions. This is called inference, the second
        step in drawing conclusions. In this unit, we look at the Inference step."/>

            population based on the data obtained from a sample chosen from it.</p> -->
<p>The purpose of this introduction is to review how we got here and how the previous units fit
            together to allow us to make reliable inferences. Also, we will introduce the various
            forms of statistical inference that will be discussed in this section, and give a
            general outline of how this section is organized.</p>
<p>In the <em>Exploratory Data Analysis</em> unit, we learned to display and summarize data that
            were obtained from a sample. Regardless of whether we had one variable and we examined
            its distribution, or whether we had two variables and we examined the relationship
            between them, it was always understood that these summaries applied <em style="italic"
                >only</em> to the data at hand; we did not attempt to make claims about the larger
            population from which the data were obtained.</p>
<p>Such generalizations were, however, a long-term goal from the very beginning of the course. For
            this reason, in the <em>Producing Data</em> unit, we took care to establish principles
            of sampling and study design that would be essential in order for us to claim that, to
            some extent, what is true for the sample should be also true for the larger population
            from which the sample originated. These principles should be kept in mind throughout
            this section on statistical inference, since the results that we will obtain will not
            hold if there was bias in the sampling process, or flaws in the study design under which
            variables' values were measured. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most important principle stressed in the Producing Data unit was that of
            randomization. Randomization is
            essential not only because it prevents bias but also because it permits us to rely on the laws of
            probability, which is the scientific study of random behavior.</p>
<p>In the <em>Probability </em>unit, we established basic laws for the behavior of random variables.
            We ultimately focused on two random variables of particular relevance: the sample mean
                (<m:math overflow="scroll">
                <m:mrow>
                    <m:mover>
                        <m:mi>X</m:mi>
                        <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
                    </m:mover>
                </m:mrow>
            </m:math>) and the sample proportion (<m:math overflow="scroll">
                <m:mrow>
                    <m:mover>
                        <m:mi>p</m:mi>
                        <m:mo stretchy="true">ˆ</m:mo>
                    </m:mover>
                </m:mrow>
            </m:math> ), and the last module of the Probability unit was devoted to exploring their
            sampling distributions. We learned what probability theory tells us to expect from the
            values of the sample mean and the sample proportion, given that the corresponding
            population parameters&#8212;the population mean (μ) and the population proportion
            (p)&#8212;are known.</p>
<p>As we mentioned in that module, the value of such results is more theoretical than practical,
            since in real-life situations we seldom know what is true for the entire population. All
            we know is what we see in the sample, and we want to use this information to say
            something concrete about the larger population. Probability theory has set the stage to
            accomplish this: learning what to expect from the value of sample mean, given that
            population mean takes a certain value, teaches us (as we'll soon learn) what to expect
            from the value of
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T090954-0500"?>the
            <?oxy_insert_end?>unknown population mean, given that a particular value of sample mean
            has been observed. Similarly, since we have established how sample proportion behaves
            relative to population proportion, we will now be able to turn this around and say
            something about the value of population proportion, based on an observed sample
            proportion. This
            process<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T091015-0500"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T091011-0500" content="---"?>inferring
