        <title>Statistical Inference</title>
    </head>

        <p>Recall again the Big Picture, the four-step process that encompasses statistics: data
            production, exploratory data analysis, probability, and inference.</p>
        <p>We are about to start the fourth part of the process and the final section of this course, where we draw on
            principles learned in the other units (exploratory data analysis, producing data, and
            probability) in order to accomplish what has been our ultimate
            goal all along: use a sample to infer (or draw conclusions) about the
            population from
            which it was drawn. As you'll see in the introduction, the specific
            form of inference called for depends on the type of variables
            involved: either
            a single categorical or quantitative variable or a combination of two variables whose
            relationship is of interest.</p>

of Statistics. First, a set of data was created from subset of the population. This is the Producing
Data step. Then, we perform exploratory data analysis on the data. With these results, we apply
probability which is our first step in drawing conclusions about the population from the data. After
we have applied probability to the data, we can draw conclusions. This is called inference, the second
step in drawing conclusions. In this unit we will be looking at the Inference step."/>
