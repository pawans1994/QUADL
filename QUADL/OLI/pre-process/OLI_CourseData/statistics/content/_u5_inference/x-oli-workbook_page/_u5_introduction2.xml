        <title>Introduction to Inference (2 of 2)</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>We introduce three forms of statistical inference in this unit, each one
            representing a different way of using the information obtained in the sample to draw
            conclusions about the population. These forms are:</p>
       <ul> 
        <li>Point estimation</li>
        <li>Interval estimation</li>
        <li>Hypothesis testing</li>
       </ul>
        <p>Obviously, each one of these forms of inference will be discussed at length in this
            section, but it would be useful to get at least an intuitive sense of the nature of each
            of these inference forms, and the difference between them in terms of the
            type
            of conclusions they draw about the population based on the sample results.</p>
        <p>In <em>point
            estimation</em><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101123T091335-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            we estimate an unknown parameter using a <em style="italic">single number</em> that is calculated from the sample data.</p>
        <example>
            <p>Based on sample results, we estimate that p, the proportion of all
                U.S.
                adults who are in favor of stricter gun control, is 0.6.</p>
        </example>
        <p>In <em>interval estimation</em>,
            we estimate an unknown parameter using
            an <em>interval of values</em> that is likely to contain the true value of that
            parameter (and state how confident we are that this interval indeed captures the true
            value of the parameter).</p>
        <example>
            <p>Based on sample results, we are 95% confident that p, the proportion of
                U.S. adults who are in favor of stricter gun control, is between 0.57 and 0.63.</p>
        </example>
        <p>In <em>hypothesis
            testing</em>,
            we have some claim about the population, and we check <em>whether or not the data</em>
            obtained from the sample <em>provide evidence against this claim.</em>
        </p>
        <example>
            <title>1</title>
            <p>It was claimed that among all
                U.S. adults, about half are in favor of stricter gun control and about half are against
                it. In a recent poll of a random sample of 1,200 U.S. adults, 60% were in favor of stricter gun control. This data, therefore, provides
                some evidence against the claim.</p>
        </example>
        <example>
            <title>2</title>
            <p>It is claimed that among drivers 18-23 years of age (our population) there is no
                relationship between drunk driving and gender. A roadside survey collected data from
                a random sample of
                5,000
                drivers and
                recorded,their gender and whether they were drunk. The collected data showed roughly the
                same percent of drunk drivers among males and among females. These data, therefore,
                do not give us any reason to reject the claim that drunk driving is not related to
                gender.</p>

        <p>In terms of organization, the Inference unit consists of two main parts: Inference for One Variable and Inference for
            Relationships between Two Variables. The organization of each of these parts will be
            discussed further as we proceed through the unit.</p>
