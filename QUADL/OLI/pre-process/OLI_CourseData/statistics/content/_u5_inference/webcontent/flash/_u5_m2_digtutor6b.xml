Part-time students are included, so there are some extreme low outliers in the data. (ii) Survey random samples of 5 seniors, 5 juniors, 5 sophomores, and 5 freshmen, and get them to report the number of credits they are taking.  Only full-time students are being considered, and the distributions do not display any skewedness or outliers.  Which of the above two designs should not be handled with ANOVA?</mattext></material>          <response_lid rcardinality="Single" ident="LID_01">            <render_choice>              <response_label ident="Res1">                <material>                  <mattext texttype="text/plain">design (i)</mattext></material></response_label>              <response_label ident="Res2">                <material>                  <mattext texttype="text/plain">design (ii)</mattext></material></response_label>              </render_choice></response_lid></presentation>        <resprocessing>          <outcomes>            <decvar varname="SCORE" vartype="integer"></decvar></outcomes>          <respcondition>            <conditionvar>              <varequal respident="LID_01">Res1</varequal></conditionvar>            <setvar varname="SCORE">10</setvar>            <displayfeedback feedbacktype="Response" linkrefid="FeedBack0"></displayfeedback></respcondition>          <respcondition>            <conditionvar>              <varequal respident="LID_01">Res2</varequal></conditionvar>            <setvar varname="SCORE">0</setvar>            <displayfeedback feedbacktype="Response" linkrefid="FeedBack1"></displayfeedback></respcondition>          </resprocessing>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack0">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Good Job!  Indeed, this design should not be handled with ANOVA. The sample sizes are quite low (all of size 5), and there is a violation of the normality assumption in the form of extreme outliers.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack1">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect.  Note that in design (i), the sample sizes are quite low (all of size 5), and there is a violation of the normality assumption in the form of extreme outliers.  In design (ii), the sample sizes are also small, but the data does not display any violation of the normality assumption, so ANOVA can be used. </mattext></material></itemfeedback>        </item></questestinterop>
