            <mattext texttype="text/plain">The p-value is so small that Minitab reports that it is essentially 0. This means that it would be (almost) impossible to obtain data like that observed (or more extreme) just by chance (i.e., if risk of alcohol problems and participation in the 9/11 rescue were not related). This provides very strong evidence against Ho, and we can conclude that risk of alcohol problems among NYC fire fighters is related to participation in the 9/11 rescue.</mattext></material>
