Indeed, this design should not be handled with ANOVA since the samples are not independent (all four samples have the same 40 students).</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack1">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect.  Note that in design (i), the samples are not independent (all four samples have the same 40 students), and therefore ANOVA should not be used. In design (ii), the samples are independent (since each of them was chosen randomly) which is required in order to use ANOVA. </mattext></material></itemfeedback>        </item></questestinterop>
