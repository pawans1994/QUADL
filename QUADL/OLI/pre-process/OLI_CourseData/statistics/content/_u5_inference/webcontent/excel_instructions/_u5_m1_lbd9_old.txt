<ul><li>Once we have calculated our test statistic z, we find the probability that p is less than or equal to the test statistic z using the Excel formula <code style="inline">=NORMSDIST(z)</code>.</li><li>Since our alternative hypothesis is that p is <code style="inline">greater than</code> z, we then find the p-value that we want by subtracting the value we just calculated from 1.</li></ul>
