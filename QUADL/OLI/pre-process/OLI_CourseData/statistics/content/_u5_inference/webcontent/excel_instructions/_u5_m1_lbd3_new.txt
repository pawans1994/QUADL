<ul><li>To calculate the sample mean, simply take the average of all of the values of the dataset: <code style="inline">=average(A2:A126)</code>.</li><li>To calculate the margin of error, we can use an Excel function called CONFIDENCE (a, s, n), where a is the significance level, s is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size. Note that the significance level a = 1 - C, where C is the confidence level (in our case, 0.99). In this case, we enter the formula as follows: <code style="inline">=CONFIDENCE(0.01, 500, 125)</code>, which gives us 115.19 for our margin of error.</li><li>The confidence interval is then written as (estimate - margin of error, estimate + margin of error).</li></ul>
