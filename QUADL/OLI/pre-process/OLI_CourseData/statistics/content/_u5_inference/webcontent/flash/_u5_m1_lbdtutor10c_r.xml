            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Here is the R output:
            
&gt; p = prop.test(3900,20000,0.2,alternative="less",conf.level=0.95, correct=FALSE); p

        1-sample proportions test without continuity correction
        
data:  3900 out of 20000, null probability 0.2
X-squared = 3.125, df = 1, p-value = 0.03855
alternative hypothesis: true p is less than 0.2 
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.0000000 0.1996493
sample estimates:
    p
0.195

&gt; z = -sqrt(p$statistic); z
X-squared
-1.767767

Even though the sample results are similar to what we got before (sample proportion of 0.195), since they are based on a much larger sample (20,000 compared to 400) now they are statistically significant (at the 0.05 level, since 0.039 is less than 0.05). In this case we can therefore reject Ho and conclude that the repair reduced the proportion of defective products to below 0.20. 

Summary:
This is perhaps an "extreme" example, yet it is effective in illustrating the important distinction between practical importance and statistical significance. A reduction of 0.005 (or 0.5%) in the proportion of defective products probably does not carry any practical importance, however, because of the large sample size, this reduction is statistically significant. In general, with a sufficiently large sample size you can make any result that has very little practical importance, statistically significant. This suggests that when interpreting the results of a test, you should always think not only about the statistical significance of the results but also on their practical importance. </mattext></material>
