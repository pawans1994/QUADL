Note that these might look a little different than the ones you generated depending on the version of Excel you are using, but the values should be the same.Let's check the conditions:(i) We are told that the sample was chosen at random, so that the three eye-color samples are independent.(ii) The sample sizes are quite low, but the boxplots do not display any extreme violation of the normality assumption in the form of extreme skewedness or outliers.(iii) We can assume that the equal population standard deviation assumption since the rule of thumb is satisfied (1.843/1.365 less than 2)In summary, we can safely proceed with the ANOVA F-test</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
