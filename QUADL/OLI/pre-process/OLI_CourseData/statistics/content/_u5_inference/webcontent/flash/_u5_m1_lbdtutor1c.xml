We are 95% confident that &#x03BC; is between (257 , 263). Since all of this interval (i.e., all the plausible values for &#x03BC;) is below 268, we can say with 95% confidence that the mean pregnancy length of women who smoke during pregnancy is lower than that of the general population (which is 268).
