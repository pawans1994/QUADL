Note that in design (ii) the largest among the sample standard deviations (5.4) is more than twice as large as the smallest one (1.9). Since this rule of the thumb is not satisfied, we cannot assume that condition (iii) of equal population standard deviations is satisfied, and cannot therefore use ANOVA. In design (i), the rule of thumb is satisfied (3.4/1.9 less than 2).</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack1">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Good Job!
