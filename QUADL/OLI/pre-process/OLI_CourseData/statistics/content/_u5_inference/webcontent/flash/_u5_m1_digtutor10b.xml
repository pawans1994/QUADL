Indeed, since the p-value is small (less than .05) we have evidence to reject Ho and accept Ha, or in other words, conclude that the majority of US adults oppose gay marriage.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack2">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect.  While this statement is a legitimate conclusion, it is not the right conclusion in this case.  Since the p-value is small (less than .05) we reject Ho, and accept Ha. </mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack3">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect.  Recall that when the p-value (less than .05) we conclude that the data provide enough evidence to reject Ho and accept Ha.   It should be noted that the statement that you chose is actually statistically wrong.  Note that the proportion of US adults who oppose gay marriage is a parameter (p), and therefore a fixed, unknown quantity which we are doing inference about. You can talk about the probability that a random variable takes a certain value(s), but not about the probability or likelihood that a fixed quantity takes a certain value(s). </mattext></material></itemfeedback>        </item></questestinterop>
