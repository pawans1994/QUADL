In question 1, though, we found that the margin of error of this poll is roughly 2.9%. This is a great example to show you what we mean by "conservative" margin of error. The margin of error found in question 1 was found using the conservative approach and is the margin of error of the whole poll. What it says is:Based on this sample size, the margin of error for any of the questions in this poll will be no more than 2.9% regardless of what the sample proportions are.In the particular question from the poll in this example, the margin of error happened to be lower.</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
