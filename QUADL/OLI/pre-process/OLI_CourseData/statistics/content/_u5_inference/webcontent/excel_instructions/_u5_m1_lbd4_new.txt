<ul><li>To calculate the critical value t*, we use the Excel function TINV(probability, degrees of freedom). In this case, we would type <code style="inline">=TINV(0.05, 141)</code>.</li><li>To calculate the sample mean, use the AVERAGE function. In this case, we would type <code style="inline">=AVERAGE(A2:A143)</code>.</li><li>To calculate the sample standard deviation, use the STDEV function. In this case, we would type <code style="inline">=STDEV(A2:A143)</code>.</li><li>To calculate the standard error, we'll divide the sample standard deviation that we just calculated by the square root of n.</li><li>Finally, we calculate the margin of error by multiplying the critical t* value by the standard error</li></ul>
