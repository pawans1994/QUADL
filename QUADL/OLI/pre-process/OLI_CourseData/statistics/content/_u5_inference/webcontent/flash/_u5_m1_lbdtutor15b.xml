The distribution of the data is extremely skewed to the right and has high outliers.b. The conditions are met since:         (i) The sample is random      (ii) The sample size is large enough (n=75) for the Central Limit Theorem to kick in and ensure that the sample mean varies normally, despite the fact that the distribution of the variable of interest (number of alcoholic drinks per week) is extremely skewed to the right with high outliers.c. Students attending a required introductory statistics class is not a random sample of students in the college, and can probably not be treated as one either. Students taking introductory courses are mostly freshman which for the most part are at an age where drinking alcohol is not legal. The data obtained from such a sample will therefore most likely be biased, and will not be representative of the entire student body of the college.  </mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
