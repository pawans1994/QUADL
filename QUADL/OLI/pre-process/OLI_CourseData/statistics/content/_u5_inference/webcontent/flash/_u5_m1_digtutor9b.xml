Indeed, the alternative hypothesis usually represents what we want to check, or what we suspect is really going on.  In this case what the researcher suspects that is going on is that the proportion of smokers among US adults (25+) who have a Bachelor's degree or higher is lower than the rate of all adults in this age group.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack1">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect.  You chose the null hypothesis as the alternative hypothesis.  Recall that the alternative hypothesis, Ha, usually represents what we (or in this case the researcher) want(s) to check, or what we (the researcher) suspect(s) is really going on. </mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack2">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect.
