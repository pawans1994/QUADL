In particular, no information is given on how the babies were selected for the study, which is important for assessing whether we can assume that the observations are independent.

Given this information, we can assume that the observations are independent (even though it doesn't explicitly say that the sample was random).  The only way (that I can think of) that the independence assumption would be violated is if twins (or triplets....) were included in the study, which I am pretty sure was not the case.            Comment:  Even though the sample was chosen from a specific hospital (rather than from the "entire population of infants"), unless the infants who were born in this specific hospital at the time of the study were systematically different from infants in general in some relevant way, it will still be reasonable to attempt to generalize the results to infants in general.  As for the other conditions:  The relationship seems linear (even though it is moderately weak), the scatterplot does not display any alarming outliers, and the sample size is reasonably large (n=38).</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
