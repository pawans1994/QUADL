Indeed, since the p-value of the test was .001, Ho was rejected (at the .05 significance level, or even lower levels).  This means that the 95% confidence interval for p cannot include .605 as a plausible value, which both the third and fourth confidence intervals satisfy. Comment: The third confidence interval is the actual one that was found in the follow up study.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        </item></questestinterop>
