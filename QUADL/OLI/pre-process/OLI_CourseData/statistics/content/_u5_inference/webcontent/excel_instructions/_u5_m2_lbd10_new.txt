Now use the <code style="inline">CHITEST</code> function in Excel to calculate the p-value given the data in our tables. To do this, pick an empty cell and type <code style="inline">=CHITEST([actual range], [expected range])</code> where [actual range] is the range of observed data in our table (without row/column headers or totals) and [expected range] is the range of expected data in our table (again without row/column headers or totals).
