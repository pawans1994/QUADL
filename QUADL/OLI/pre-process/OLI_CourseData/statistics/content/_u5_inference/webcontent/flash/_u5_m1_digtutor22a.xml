        <mattext texttype="text/plain">&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Dartmouth Medical School conducted a study in 2003 to look at the connection between watching actors smoking in movies and smoking initiation among adolescents.  The study randomly selected 6522 U.S. adolescents aged 10 - 14 who had never tried smoking.  Of those who subsequently tried smoking for the first time, 38% did so because of exposure to smoking in the movies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Estimate the proportion of all U.S. adolescents aged 10 - 14 who started smoking because of seeing actors smoke in movies by constructing a 95% confidence interval.&lt;/p&gt;</mattext></material>
