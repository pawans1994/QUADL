Recall that r measures the strength of the linear relationship in our data (where the closer r is to -1 or 1, the stronger the linear relationship).  The p-value of the test measures the strength of the evidence provided by the data that what was observed can be generalized to the relevant population (where the smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence). </mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack1">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect.

It is true that r=0.4 indicates that there a moderately weak linear relationship in our data.

Indeed, r = 0.4 indicates that there is a moderately weak linear relationship between cry count and IQ in our data. In addition, the small p-value (0.012) tell us that this data provide fairly strong evidence that this linear relationship can be generalized to infants in general.  </mattext></material></itemfeedback>        </item></questestinterop>
