In other words, the next step would be to carry out a significance test that will assess whether observing data like ours (where there is a difference of 8% between the firefighters who participated in the 911 rescue and those who didn't) could have happened just by chance or that it provides enough evidence that risk of alcohol related problems among NY firefighters  is indeed related to participation in the 911 rescue. You'll have to wait for the next acitivities.....</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
