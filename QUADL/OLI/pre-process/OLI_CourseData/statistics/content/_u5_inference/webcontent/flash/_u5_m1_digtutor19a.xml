Note that the t-distribution is more spread out than the z-distribution and, therefore, values that are further away from the mean (0) are more likely. In particular, under the t-distribution it is more likely to get values that are above 3 than under the Z-distribution. Visually, you can see that the t-distribution has heavier tails and, therefore, the area under the t-distribution to the right of 3 is larger than the area to the right of 3 under the Z distribution.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack1">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Good Job!
