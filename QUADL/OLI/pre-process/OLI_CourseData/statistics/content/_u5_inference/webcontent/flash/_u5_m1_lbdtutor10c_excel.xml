In this case we can therefore reject Ho and conclude that the repair reduced the proportion of defective products to below .20. Summary:This is perhaps an "extreme" example, yet it is effective in illustrating the important distinction between practical importance and statistical significance. A reduction of .005 (or .5%) in the proportion of defective products probably does not carry any practical importance, however, because of the large sample size, this reduction is statistically significant. In general, with a sufficiently large sample size you can make any result that has very little practical importance, statistically significant. This suggests that when interpreting the results of a test, you should always think not only about the statistical significance of the results but also on their practical importance. </mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
