Even though the p-value is quite small, it is not small enough if we use a significance level (cut-off probability) of .05. This means that even though the data show some evidence against the null hypothesis it isn't quite strong enough to reject it. We therefore conclude that the data do not provide enough evidence that kiln-dried seeds yield more corn than regular seeds.Comment: While it is true that at the .05 significance level, our p-value is not small enough to reject Ho, it is "almost small enough". In other words, this is sort of a "borderline case" where personal interpretation/judgment is in order. You can stick to the .05 cut-off as we did above in our conclusion, but you might decide that .061 is small enough for you, and that the evidence that the data provide is strong enough for you to believe that indeed kiln-dried seeds yield more corn. This is the beauty of statistics...there is no "black or white", and there is a lot of room for personal interpretation. </mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
