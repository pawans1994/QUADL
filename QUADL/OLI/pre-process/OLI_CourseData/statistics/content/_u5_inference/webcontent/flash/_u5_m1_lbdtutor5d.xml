Do you think that the results of the current study (where the 95% confidence interval is (.53 , .59) provide evidence that the public opinion on the topic of legalization of marijuana has changed over the past two years?</mattext></material>          <response_str ident="Short answer 1">            <render_fib fibtype="String" prompt="Box">              <response_label ident="Res 1"/></render_fib></response_str></presentation>        <resprocessing>          <outcomes/>          <respcondition>            <conditionvar>              <other/></conditionvar>            <displayfeedback linkrefid="Feedback always"/></respcondition></resprocessing>        <itemfeedback ident="solution">          <solution>          <solutionmaterial>          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">The answer is no, we do not have evidence to conclude that the public opinion has changed. Here is why.  The two confidence intervals (.48,.54) and (.53,.59) overlap which means that there are some plausible values for p which the two polls share (in particular, the values between .53 and .54), and we can not the rule out the possibility that p is one of these values.
