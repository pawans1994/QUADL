Typically we look at a histogram.Comment: some prefer to look at a boxplot of the data, since outliers are clearly marked, and skewedness is apparent by the location of the middle line inside the box (which represents the location of the median relative to the quartiles). We recommend looking at the histogram (as we did previously) or at both graphs.      Click &lt;a href="javascript:loadImage('../../../webcontent/flash/images/lbd010.gif')"&gt;&lt;font color="#CC6666"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to see the histogram and boxplot of the data.Both graphs show us that the data does not display any departure from the normality assumption in the form of extreme skewedness and/or outliers. (Note that 1. with such a small sample size of n=11 we cannot really expect to see a normal shape in the histogram, so as long as we don't see anything that is extremely "non-normal", we're fine. 2. The boxplot shows us that no observation was classified as an outlier, and that there is no extreme skewedness since the median -- the line inside the box -- is roughly in the middle of the box).In summary, we can safely proceed with the paired t-test.</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
