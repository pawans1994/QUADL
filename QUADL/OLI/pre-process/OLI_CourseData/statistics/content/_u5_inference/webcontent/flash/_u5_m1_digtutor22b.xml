        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Harris Interactive&#174; conducted an online study from January 3 to 10, 2006 among a nationwide sample of 1,040 U.S. adults (aged 18 years and over), of whom 565 currently use organic foods in preparing meals. Figures for age by gender, race/ethnicity, education, region, and household income were weighted to reflect the total U.S. adult population. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for respondentsâ€™ propensity to be online.  Construct a 99% confidence interval for the proportion of all U.S. adults who use organic foods in preparing meals.</mattext></material>
