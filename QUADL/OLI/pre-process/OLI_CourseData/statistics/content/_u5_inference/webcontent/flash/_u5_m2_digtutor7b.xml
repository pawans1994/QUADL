On the contrary. expected counts are calculated assuming that the null hypothesis is true.  Also, this answer implies that expected counts are calculated only after the chi-square test has been carried out. This is not the case since expected counts are needed in order to carry out the test.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>		<itemfeedback ident="FeedBack4">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Good Job. Indeed, expected counts are calculated assuming that the two categorical variables (in this case gender and piercing) are independent (or not related), which is exactly what is claimed by the null hypothesis.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        </item></questestinterop>
