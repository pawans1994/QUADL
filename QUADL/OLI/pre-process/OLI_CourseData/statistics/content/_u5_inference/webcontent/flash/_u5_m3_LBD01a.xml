						<mattext texttype="">The reading score is negatively related toTV6 and Poor and positively related to Parents. This is definitely what one would expect. The more students spend their time watching TV, the less time they spend reading, and students who live in poor areas usually do not have access to good educational. On the other hand, children of parents who are college graduates tend to have a higher socioeconomic status and thus exposed to better education.</mattext>
						<mattext texttype="text/plain">Of the three explanatory variables, TV6 has the strongest relationship with R.score as supported by the scatterplots and the correlation matrix noting the correlation between R.score and TV6 is the largest is magnitude (-.68).</mattext>
						<mattext texttype="text/plain">Among the explanatory variables, the pair that is most correlated is TV6 and Parents (r=-.385).</mattext>
