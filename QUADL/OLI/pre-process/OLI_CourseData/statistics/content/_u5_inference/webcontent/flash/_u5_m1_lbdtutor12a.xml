For a sample of size 20, the shape is definitely normal enough for us to assume that the variable varies normally in the population and therefore it is safe to proceed with the test.time2 - The histogram displays a distribution which is slightly skewed and does not have any outliers. The histogram, therefore, does not give us any reason to be concerned that for a sample of size 20 the Central Limit Theorem will not kick in. We can therefore proceed with the test.time3 - The distribution does not have any "special" shape, and has one small outlier which is not very extreme (although it is arguable whether you would classify it as an outlier). Again, the histogram does not give us any reason to be concerned that for a sample of size 20 the Central Limit Theorem will not kick in.  We can therefore proceed with the test.time4 - The distribution is extremely skewed to the right, and has one pretty extreme high outlier. Based on this histogram we should be cautious about proceeding with the test, because assuming that this histogram "paints" (at least a rough) picture of how the variable varies in the population, a sample of size 20 might not be large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to kick in and ensure that x-bar has a normal distribution.</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
