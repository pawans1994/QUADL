            <mattext texttype="text/plain">In this case, we would test:
            
H0: &#x03BC; = 4.73
Ha: &#x03BC; &lt; 4.73 

The p-value for this test would be 0.071/2 = 0.0355 (half that of the two sided test). At the 0.05 significance level, we would therefore reject H0 and conclude that the data provide evidence that the mean number of alcoholic drinks that students in the college have in a typical week is indeed lower than the mean of U.S. college students in general (as the dean suspected).</mattext></material>
