        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Correct. When we have a p-value &lt; 0.05, it is unlikely that the observed data could happen by chance. Thus, we would reject the null hypothesis (of no linear correlation between response time and damage in a fire) and conclude that there is indeed significant evidence of a linear relationship between them.</mattext></material></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
