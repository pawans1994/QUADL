It seems like that there is a reasonable amount of evidence in the data against Ho. The three boxplots do not overlap much, and it really doesn't seem very likely  that the three populations from which these three samples were chosen all share the same mean. </mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
