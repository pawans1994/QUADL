Since the 40 subjects were chosen at random, we can assume that the two samples are independent.2. Since the sample sizes (22 and 18) are not large, for the two-sample t-test to be reliably used the two populations need to be (at least) close to normal.In practice, we check by looking at our two samples using histograms and make sure that we don't see any gross violation of the normality assumption.  However, both histograms display clear violations from the normality assumption in the form of extreme skewedness and outliers (click &lt;a href="javascript:loadImage('../../../webcontent/flash/images/lbd008.gif')"&gt;&lt;font color="#CC6666"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to see the histograms.)  In conclusion, the two-sample t-test cannot be reliably used.</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
