Recall that the null hypothesis suggests nothing special is going on, no change from the status quo, no difference from the traditional state of affairs.

Indeed, the null hypothesis claims that "nothing special is going on" or "no change from the status quo" which in this context is that there is nothing special going on in the group of adults (25+) who have a Bachelor's degree or higher in terms of the rate of smokers. It is the same as in the entire population of adults (25+).</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack2">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect.  Recall that the null hypothesis suggests nothing special is going on, no change from the status quo, no difference from the traditional state of affairs.

While it is true that the option you chose could be a null hypothesis, it is not the null hypothesis in this case.
