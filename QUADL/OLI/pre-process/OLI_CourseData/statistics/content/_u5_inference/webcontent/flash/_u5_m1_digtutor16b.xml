Recall that the p-value of the two-sided test is twice the p-value of a one-sided test (based on the same data).  If Ho can be rejected in test I (at the .05 significance level), it means that the p-value is below .05.  This implies that since the p-value of test II must be, then, below .05/2=.025, Ho will also be rejected in that test.  There is NO WAY, then that Ho is rejected in the two-sided test and not rejected in the one-sided test.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>		<itemfeedback ident="FeedBack4">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect.
