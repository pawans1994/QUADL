The confidence intervals suggest that the mean CFF of people with brown eyes is smaller than that of people with blue eyes (no overlap between the two confidence intervals), and that the mean CFF of people with green eyes does not differ much from the mean CFF of both blue and brown eyed people.  Remember, however, that these are just informal observations based on our data.</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
