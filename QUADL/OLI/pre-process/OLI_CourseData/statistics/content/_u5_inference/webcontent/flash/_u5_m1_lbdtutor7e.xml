Recall that in hypothesis testing we can NEVER conclude that we accept Ho (or that Ho is true). All we can say (in case we do not get a small p-value) is that we do not have enough evidence to reject Ho.In particular in this case we found that 10.2% of the 175 newborns were at low birth weight (which is higher than 7.8%, the overall proportion). While this result did not provide enough evidence to conclude that second-hand smoking increases the risk of low lightweight, it definitely does not provide evidence that it doesn't! (which is what Ho claims).</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
