            <mattext texttype="text/plain">What do you think is the minimum number of marijuana users (out of 100 students) that would be enough evidence to reject H<sub>0</sub> and conclude that p is greater than 0.157? Use just your intuition. If you needed to decide whether or not to reject H<sub>0</sub> based on a sample of size 100 students, how many marijuana users would you need to find to convince you that p is greater than 0.157? 

(There is no right or wrong answer here.)

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">As the question states, there is no right or wrong answer at this point. Personally, not being a big "risk-taker," if I find that 25 out of the 100 are marijuana users, that will convince me to reject H<sub>0</sub>. Anything below 25 would not be enough for me.

To help us answer this question more accurately, let's look at a table that lists various sample counts/proportions of users, the corresponding z statistic, and the associated p-value. Click &lt;a href="javascript:loadImage('../../../webcontent/flash/images/lbd004.gif')"&gt;&lt;font color="#CC6666"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to see the table. Note that we highlighted in red the result we got in our sampleâ€”19 users.

This is a great opportunity to see how the p-value "works" as a measure of evidence against H<sub>0</sub>; the smaller it is the more evidence is "stored" in the data against H<sub>0</sub>. Obviously, if finding 19 marijuana users was not enough evidence to reject H<sub>0</sub> and conclude that p, the proportion of marijuana users in the college is higher than 0.157 (the national figure), than anything below 19 would not be enough either since it provides even less evidence against H<sub>0</sub>. See in the green section above how this is depicted by the values of the p-value, which get larger as the number of marijuana users gets smaller. On the other hand, it is pretty clear that the more marijuana users we see in our sample, the more evidence we have to reject H<sub>0</sub> and conclude that p > 0.157. Note that the p-values get smaller as the number of marijuana users increase.</mattext>
