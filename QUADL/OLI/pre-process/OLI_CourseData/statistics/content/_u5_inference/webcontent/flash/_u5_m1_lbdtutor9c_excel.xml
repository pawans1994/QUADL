When we calculate p-hat, we get a value of 0.1266.  When we use p-hat to calculate the test statistic z, we get a value of 8.858.  Using the NORMSDIST function gives a value of 1, which is the probability that p is less than or equal to the test statistic z.  Since we want the probability that p is greater than the test statistic, we subtract this value from 1, giving us a p-value of 0.</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
