In particular since the p-value is less than .05, we conclude that the data provide enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of low birth weight babies born to mothers who smoked during their pregnancy is higher than the overall proportion of low birth weight.</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
