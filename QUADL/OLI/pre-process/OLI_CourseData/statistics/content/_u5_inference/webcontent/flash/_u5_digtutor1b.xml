To check the company's claim, 500 students who took the company's course were sampled and it was found that 407 of them (81.4%) actually improved their SAT score after attending the course. Based on the sample results, we have some serious doubts regarding the accuracy of the company's claim.</mattext></material>          <response_lid rcardinality="Single" ident="LID_01">            <render_choice>              <response_label ident="Res1">                <material>                  <mattext texttype="text/plain">point estimation</mattext></material></response_label>              <response_label ident="Res2">                <material>                  <mattext texttype="text/plain">interval estimation</mattext></material></response_label>              <response_label ident="Res3">                <material>                  <mattext texttype="text/plain">hypothesis testing</mattext></material></response_label>              </render_choice></response_lid></presentation>        <resprocessing>          <outcomes>            <decvar varname="SCORE" vartype="integer"></decvar></outcomes>          <respcondition>            <conditionvar>              <varequal respident="LID_01">Res1</varequal></conditionvar>            <setvar varname="SCORE">0</setvar>            <displayfeedback feedbacktype="Response" linkrefid="FeedBack0"></displayfeedback></respcondition>          <respcondition>            <conditionvar>              <varequal respident="LID_01">Res2</varequal></conditionvar>            <setvar varname="SCORE">0</setvar>            <displayfeedback feedbacktype="Response" linkrefid="FeedBack1"></displayfeedback></respcondition>          <respcondition>            <conditionvar>              <varequal respident="LID_01">Res3</varequal></conditionvar>            <setvar varname="SCORE">10</setvar>            <displayfeedback feedbacktype="Response" linkrefid="FeedBack2"></displayfeedback></respcondition>          </resprocessing>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack0">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect.
