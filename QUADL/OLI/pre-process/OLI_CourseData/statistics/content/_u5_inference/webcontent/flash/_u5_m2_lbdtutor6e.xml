          <mattext texttype="text/plain">The test statistic is 4.8 (which is quite large), and the
            p-value is .023, indicating that it is unlikely (probability of .023) to get data like
            that observed assuming that CFF is not related to eye color (as the null hypothesis
            claims). Since the p-value is small (in particular, smaller than .05), we have enough
            evidence in the data to reject Ho and conclude that the mean CFF in the three eye-color
            populations are not all the same. In other words, we can conclude that CFF is related to
            eye color. </mattext>
