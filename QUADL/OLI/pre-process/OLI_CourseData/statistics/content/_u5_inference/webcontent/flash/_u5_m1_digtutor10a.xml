Recall that the p-value is the probability of observing data like that observed assuming that the null hypothesis, Ho, is true. Actually, the statement that you chose is statistically wrong. Note that the proportion of US adults who oppose gay marriage is a parameter (p), and therefore a fixed, unknown quantity which we are doing inference about.  You can talk about the probability that a random variable takes a certain value(s), but not about the probability that a fixed quantity takes a certain value(s). In the next activity, this issue will come up again.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack2">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Good Job!
