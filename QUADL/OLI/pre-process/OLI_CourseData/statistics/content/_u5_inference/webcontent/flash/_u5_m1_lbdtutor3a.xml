          <matimage label="" uri="../../../webcontent/flash/_u5_m1_lbdtutor3a_image1.jpg"/>
          <mattext texttype="text/plain">We are 99% confident that the mean birth weight of first
            babies to mothers who are 35 or older is between (rounding) 2996 and 3227 grams.
            Comments: 1. Note that in the output, Minitab also calculates the sample standard
            deviation, s, (under StDev) and another quantity denoted by "SE Mean" (which we will
            discuss in the course shortly). Even though both these quantities are not needed for
            calculating the confidence interval, it is quite encouraging to see that the sample
            standard deviation is 501.32 since this means that our assumption of &#x03C3; = 500 is
            quite reasonable. 2. If you go back for a minute to the dialog box (Stat →
            Basic statistics → 1 Sample Z) you'll notice that there is also the option
            to give Minitab "Summarized data" instead of the raw data (i.e., the sample size n and
            mean x-bar). As we mentioned earlier in this activity, in cases like these, it would be
            easier to simply use the formula ourselves, but it is noteworthy that the option in
            Minitab exists. </mattext>
