We therefore obtain: Predicted IQ = 90.8 + 1.54*25 = 129.3. &lt;a href="javascript:loadImage('../../../webcontent/flash/images/lbd016.gif')"&gt;&lt;font color="#CC6666"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the graph.			It should be noted, however that due to the moderately weak linearity this prediction is not very accurate in the sense that the actual IQ level can be either much lower or much higher than this predicted value (in the same way that the data points are well below or above the line).  In fact, given how far the data points are from the line, the IQ could be roughly anywhere between 90 and 167 as &lt;a href="javascript:loadImage('../../../webcontent/flash/images/lbd017.gif')"&gt;&lt;font color="#CC6666"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this graph&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; displays.Our prediction of the IQ being 129 is therefore not very accurate.Comment: In the extension module to regression we'll go deeper into the issue of accuracy of prediction. For now, the visual will suffice.</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
