            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Here is the R output:

&gt; length(support[support=="satisfied"])
[1] 142
&gt; prop.test(length(support[support=="satisfied"]),length(support$opinion),conf.level=0.95)

        1-sample proportions test with continuity correction
        
data:  length(support[support == "satisfied"]) out of length(support$opinion), null probability 0.5 
X-squared = 697.6875, df = 1, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5 
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.1008769 0.1382809 
sample estimates:
      p
 0.1183333
 
(a) 142 of the 1200 sampled voters answered that they were satisfied.
(b) The sample proportion is therefore 0.118, or roughly 12% (142/1200).
(c) The 95% confidence interval for p is (0.10, 0.14).

We are 95% certain that the proportion of US voters who are satisfied with the expiration of the federal ban on assault weapons is between 0.10 and 0.14 (or between 10% and 14%).
