            <p>Based on a recent poll of 1,015 U.S. households that have an Internet connection, the
                researchers claimed with 95% confidence that among all U.S. households that have an
                Internet connection, between 63% and 67% have a high-speed link.</p></body>

            <p>A company that provides coaching for the SAT claims in one of its ads: "90% of our
                students improve their SAT scores after attending our course." To check the
                company's claim, 500 students who took the company's course were sampled, and it was
                found that 407 of them (81.4%) actually improved their SAT scores after attending
                the course. Based on the sample results, we have some serious doubts regarding the
                accuracy of the company's claim.</p></body>
