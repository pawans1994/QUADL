<title>Parameters vs. Statistics</title>
<body>
<p>To better understand the relationship between sample and population, let's consider the two examples that were mentioned in the introduction.</p>
<example><title>Example #1: Blood Type</title>

<p>In the probability
                        section<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T150738-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        we presented the distribution of blood types in the entire U.S.
                            <em>population</em>:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image002.gif" alt="A pie chart titled &quot;Blood Types
    (population).&quot; Type A is 42% of the chart, type O takes up 45% of the chart, type B
    is 10% of the chart, and type AB is 4%."/>
<p>Assume now that we take a <em>sample</em> of 500 people in the
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T150804-0500"?>United
                        States<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T150756-0500" content="U.S."?>,
                        record their blood type, and display the sample results:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image003.gif" alt="A pie char titled &quot;Blood Type
(sample 1).&quot; Here is the data for each slice on the chart:
                A: 198, 39.6%;
                O: 221, 44.2%;
                B: 59, 11.8%;
                AB: 22, 4.4%;"/>
<p>Note that the percentages (or proportions) that we got in our sample are slightly different than
                        the population percentages. This is really not surprising. Since we took a
                        sample of just
                        500<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T150827-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        we cannot expect that our sample will behave exactly like the population,
                        but if the sample is random (as it
                        was)<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T150843-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        we expect to get results which are not that far from the population (as we
                        did). If we took yet another sample of size 500:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image004.gif" alt="A pie char titled &quot;Blood Type
(sample 2).&quot; Here is the data for each slice on the chart:
                A: 216, 43.2%;
                O: 213, 42.6%;
                B: 39, 7.8%;
                AB: 32, 6.4%;"/>
<p>we again get sample results
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T150908-0500"?>that<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T150906-0500" content="which"?>
                        are slightly different from the population figures, and also different from
                        what we got in the first sample. This very intuitive idea, that sample
                        results change from sample to sample, is called <em>sampling
                            variability.</em>
                    </p>
</example>
<p>Let's look at another example:</p>
<example><title>Example #2: Heights of Adult Males</title>

<p>Heights among the population of all adult males follow a normal distribution with
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T151015-0500"?>a

                            <m:mi>μ</m:mi>
                            <m:mo>=</m:mo>
                            <m:mn>6</m:mn>
                            <m:mn>9</m:mn>
                        </m:math> inches and
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T151023-0500"?>a
                        <?oxy_insert_end?>standard deviation</p>

<m:math overflow="scroll">

<m:mo>=</m:mo>
<m:mn>2</m:mn>
<m:mo>.</m:mo>
<m:mn>8</m:mn>
</m:math> inches. Here is a probability display of this population distribution:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image007.gif" alt="A probability histogram, in which
the horizontal axis is labeled &quot;Male Height.&quot; The axis ranges from 57.6 to 80.0,
and the mode of the histogram is at a height of 69. The histogram's shape is very close to
a normal bell shape."/>
<p>A sample of 200 males was chosen, and their heights were recorded. Here are the sample results:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image009.gif" alt="A distribution histogram for
the sample. The mode for this histogram is at a height of about 70. The bars to the left
of the mode are an acceptable approximation of a normal bell curve, but to the right of
the mode, the bars drop off too suddenly to approximate a bell curve."/>
<p>The sample mean is <m:math overflow="scroll">
<m:mover accent="true">

<m:mn>8</m:mn>
<m:mo>.</m:mo>
<m:mn>7</m:mn>
</m:math> inches and the sample standard deviation is s = 2.95 inches.</p>
<p>Again, note that the sample results are slightly different from the population. The histogram we
                        got resembles the normal
                        distribution<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T151056-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                        but is not as fine, and also the sample mean and standard deviation are
                        slightly different from the population mean and standard deviation. Let's
                        take another sample of 200 males:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image011.gif" alt="A distribution histogram of another
sample. The mode is once again at about 70. The bars to the left of the mode approximate a bell
curve except for a few which are too low. To the right of the mean we have the same problem as
before - the values drop off too fast to model a bell curve."/>
<p>The sample mean is <m:math overflow="scroll">

<m:mn>6</m:mn>
<m:mn>5</m:mn>
</m:math> inches and the sample standard deviation is s = 2.659 inches.</p>
<p>Again, as in Example 1 we see the idea of <em>sampling variability.</em> Again, the sample results are pretty close to the population, 
    and different from the results we got in the first sample.</p>
</example>
<p>In both the
                    examples<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T151133-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    we have numbers that describe the population, and numbers that describe the
                    sample. In Example 1, the number 42% is the population proportion of blood type
                    A, and 39.6% is the sample proportion (in sample 1) of blood type A. In Example
                    2, 69 and 2.8 are the population mean and standard deviation, and (in sample 1)
                    68.7 and 2.95 are the sample mean and standard deviation.</p>

<p>1. Parameters are usually unknown, because it is impractical or impossible to know exactly what values a variable takes for every member of the population.</p>
<p>2. Statistics are computed from the sample, and vary from sample to sample due to <em>sampling variability</em>.</p>
<p>In the last part of the course, statistical inference, we will learn how to use a statistic to
                    draw conclusions about an unknown parameter, either by estimating it or by
                    deciding whether it is reasonable to conclude that the parameter equals a
                    proposed value. In this module, we'll learn about the behavior of the statistics
                    assuming that we know the parameters. So, for example, if we know that the
                    population proportion of blood type A in the population is .42, and we take a
                    random sample of size 500, what do we expect the sample proportion
