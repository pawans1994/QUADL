   <question id="q1">
      <body>
         <p>Find the approximate probability of at least 27 in 225 (proportion .12) being left-handed.  In other words, what is P(p-hat &#8805; 0.12)?</p>
         <p>Guidance: Note that 0.12 is exactly 1 standard deviation (0.02) above the mean (0.1). Now use the Standard Deviation Rule.</p>

         <explanation>
            <p>Note that 0.12 is exactly 1 standard deviation above the mean. The Standard Deviation
                  Rule tells us that there is a 68% chance that the sample proportion falls within 1
                  standard deviation of its mean, that is, between 0.08 and 0.12. There is therefore
                  a probability of (1 - 0.68) / 2 = 0.16 that the sample proportion falls above
                  0.12.</p>
