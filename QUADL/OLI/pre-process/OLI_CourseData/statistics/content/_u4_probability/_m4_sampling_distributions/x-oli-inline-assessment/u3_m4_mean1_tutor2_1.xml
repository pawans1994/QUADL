            <!--LO:Identify and/or calculate the mean and/or standard deviation of a sampling distribution of sample means.-->
            <body>In the simulation, we collected thousands of random samples from the population of
                babies. The mean weight for individual babies is 3,500 grams. What is the mean of
                the sample means?</body>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. The population standard deviation is 500
                        grams. What is the mean of the sampling distribution of means?</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. There were 9 babies in the sample. What is
                        the mean of the sampling distribution of means?</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. The mean of the sample means is the population mean;
                        therefore, the mean of the sample means or the sampling distribution of the
                        mean is 3,500 grams.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="D" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. There is enough information to determine the mean of the
                        sampling distribution of mean.</feedback>
                </response>
                <hint>Look at the graph on the right. It represents the sampling distribution of the sample means. What is the mean of this distribution?</hint>
