                <p>We randomly sample college graduates from public universities and determine the
                    proportion in the sample with student loans. For which of the following sample
                    sizes is a normal model a good fit for the sampling distribution of sample
                    proportions?</p>

                        6.2 is not 10 or greater. Likewise, n(1 − p) = (10)(0.38) = 3.8 is not 10 or
                        greater. So a normal model is not a good fit for the sampling distribution
