         <body>
            <p>In a sample of 225 people, would it be unusual to find that 40 people in the
               sample are left-handed? </p>
         </body>
         <short_answer id="A"/>

            <response input="A" match="*" score="1"/>
            <!--<hint>What is the p-hat for this sample? Does this p-hat fall within three standard
               deviations of p=0.01?</hint>-->
            <explanation>About 18% (40/225) of this sample is left-handed. In the previous problem,
               we determined that there is roughly a 99.7% chance that a sample proportion will fall
               between 0.04 and 0.16. So a sample proportion of 0.18 is very unlikely. Note:
               According to the Standard Deviation Rule, sample proportions greater than 0.16 will
               occur 0.15% of the time. (100% - 99.7%) / 2 = 0.15%. </explanation>
