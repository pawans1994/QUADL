                <p>Imagine that you have a very large barrel that contains tens of thousands of
                    M&#38;M's. According to the official M&#38;M website, 20% of the M&#38;M's
                    produced by the Mars Corporation are orange. 5 students each take a random
                    sample of 50 M&#38;M's and record the percentage of orange in each sample. Which
                    sequence is the most plausible for the percentage of orange candies obtained in
                    these 5 samples?</p>

                    <feedback>This is not quite right. When randomly sampling from a population in
                        which p = 0.20, we definitely expect many of the sample proportions to be
                        equal to or close to 0.20. But drawing 5 samples in a row that all have

I think after this page, student will be used to seeing the term, and you can stop reminding them of what it means and use the symbol, diescription or &quot;p-hats&quot; interchangeably"?>p-hats<?oxy_comment_end?>
                        equal to 0.20 is less likely than getting 5 p-hats close to 0.20.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Correct. We expect p-hats
                        within 1 standard deviation of p = 0.20 to be most common. The standard
                        deviation is about 0.06. 4 of the 5 p-hats in this sequence are within 0.06
                        of p = 0.20.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. We expect p-hats within 1 standard deviation of p =
                        0.20 to be most common. The standard deviation of p-hats for this scenario
                        is about 0.06. 3 of the p-hats in this sequence are over 7 standard
                        deviations above 0.20. A sequence like this one is very unlikely to occur in
                        random sampling.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. Of course, all of these are possible. Which is most
                            <em>plausible</em>? We expect p-hats within 1 standard deviation of p =
                        0.20 to be most common.</feedback>
                </response>
                <hint>Think about the center and spread in the sampling distribution. Which sample results are the most likely to occur? (Of course, all of these are possible. Which is most plausible?)
                </hint><hint>The mean of the sampling distribution is 0.20. The standard deviation is sqrt(0.2(1 âˆ’ 0.2)/50) =
                    0.06. Which sequence can we rule out because most of the p-hats
                    are more than 1 standard deviation from p = 0.20? Of the sequences left, which
                    is the most plausible?</hint>
