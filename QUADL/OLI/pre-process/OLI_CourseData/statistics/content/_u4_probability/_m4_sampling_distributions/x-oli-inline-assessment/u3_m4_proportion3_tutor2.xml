      <body>
         <p>Since the sample proportion has a normal distribution, its values follow the Standard
            Deviation Rule. What interval is almost certain (probability .997) to contain the sample
            proportion of left-handed people?</p>
      </body>

         <response input="A" match="*" score="1"/>
         <explanation>
            <p>Since the Standard Deviation Rule applies, the probability is approximately .997 that
               the sample proportion falls within 3 standard deviations of its mean, that is,
               between .1 - 3(.02) and .1 + 3(.02). There is roughly a 99.7% chance, therefore, that the
               sample proportion falls in the interval (.04, .16).</p>
