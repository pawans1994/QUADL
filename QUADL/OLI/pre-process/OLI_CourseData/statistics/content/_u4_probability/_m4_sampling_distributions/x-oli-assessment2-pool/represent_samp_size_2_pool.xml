            <p>Suppose that a candy company makes a candy bar whose weight is supposed to be 50
                grams, but in fact, the weight varies from bar to bar according to a normal
                distribution with mean μ = 50 grams and standard deviation σ = 2 grams. </p>
            <p>If the company sells the candy bars in packs of 4 bars, what can we say about the
                likelihood that the <em style="italic">average </em>weight of the bars in a randomly
                selected pack is 4 or more grams <em>lighter</em> than advertised? </p>

                <feedback>Incorrect. The sampling distribution of x-bar is normally distributed
                    regardless of sample size and the sampling distribution will have a mean μ and

                <feedback>Correct. Here we need to find the likelihood that the average weight of 4
                    bars is 4 grams or more below the advertised weight of 50 grams. In other words,
                    we need to find the likelihood that x-bar is 46 grams or less: P(X̄ ≤ 46).
                    The sampling distribution of x-bar is normal with the mean = 50 grams and the
                    standard deviation = 1 gram. The z-score of 46 is then −4, and therefore
                    P(X̄ ≤ 46) = P(Z &lt; −4) ≈ 0. </feedback>

            <p>If the company sells the jelly beans in packs of 9 bags, what can we say about the

                <feedback>Incorrect. The distribution of bag weight is normally distributed so the
                    sample size does not need to be large for the distribution of the sample mean to
                    be normal. Determine the mean and standard deviation for the sampling
                    distribution of x̄ and use this information to find the requested

                    distribution of x-bar is normal with a mean = 30g and standard deviation = 3/√(9) = 1. So P(x̄ ≤ 28) = P(z ≤ 2) = 0.025, so there is about a
                    2.5% chance that the mean bag weight will be less than 28g.</feedback>
