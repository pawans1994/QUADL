                <p>If we randomly sample 20 Pell grant recipients, would you be surprised if the
                    mean grant amount for the sample was

                <hint>The Standard Deviation Rule predicts that approximately 99.7% of the sample
                    means will fall within

                    lies outside this range, so it is very unlikely that we will see a sample with

                <explanation>Yes, it would be very surprising to see a sample mean this large. The
