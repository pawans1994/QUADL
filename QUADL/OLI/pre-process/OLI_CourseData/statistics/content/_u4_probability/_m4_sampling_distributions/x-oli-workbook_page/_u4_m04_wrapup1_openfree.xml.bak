        <title>Wrap-Up (Sampling Distributions)</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>As mentioned in the introduction, this last module in probability is the
            bridge between the probability section and inference. It focuses on the relationship
            between sample values (<em>statistics</em>) and population values (<em>parameters</em>).
            Statistics vary from sample to sample due to <em>sampling variability</em>, and
            therefore can be regarded as <em>random variables</em> whose distribution we call
                <em>sampling distribution</em>. In this module we focused on two statistics, the
                <em>sample proportion</em>, <m:math overflow="scroll">

            </m:math>, and the <em>sample mean</em><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T200251-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            <m:math overflow="scroll">

                </m:mover>
            </m:math>. Our goal was to explore the sampling distribution of these two statistics
            relative to their respective population parameters (p and <m:math overflow="scroll">
                <m:mi>μ</m:mi>
            </m:math>), and we found in <em>both</em> cases that under certain conditions the
                <em>sampling distribution is approximately normal</em>. This result is known as the
                <em>Central Limit Theorem.</em> As we'll see in the next section, the Central Limit
            Theorem is the foundation for statistical inference.</p>
