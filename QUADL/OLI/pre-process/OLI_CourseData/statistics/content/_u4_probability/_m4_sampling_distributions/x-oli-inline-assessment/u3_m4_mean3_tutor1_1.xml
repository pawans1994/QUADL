            <p>If we randomly sample 36 Pell grant recipients, would you be surprised if the
                mean grant amount for the sample was $2,940? Pick the correct response that
                gives the best reason.</p>
        </body>
        <multiple_choice shuffle="true" select="single">
            <choice value="A">Yes, $2,940 would be surprising because this sample result is more
                than 3 standard deviations from the overall mean grant amount of
                $2,600.</choice>
            <choice value="B">Yes, $2,940 would be surprising because this sample result is $340
                greater than the overall mean grant amount of $2,600.</choice>
            <choice value="C">No, $2,940 would not be surprising because this sample result is
                within 2 standard deviations of the overall mean grant amount of
                $2,600.</choice>
            <choice value="D">No, $2,940 would not be surprising because this sample result is
                only $340 greater than the overall mean grant amount of $2,600, and we expect
                there to be variability in sample means.</choice>
        </multiple_choice>
        <part>
            <response match="A" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. For n=36, sample means are approximately normal, so we can
                    use the Standard Deviation Rule. Three standard deviations above 2,600 is
                    2,600 + 3(500/6)) = 2,850). So $2,940 is more than 3 standard deviations
                    above $2,600, thus this sample mean would be surprising.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Not quite right. It is true that $2,940 is $340 greater than $2,600,
                    but we have to analyze this difference relative to the standard deviation in
                    sample means to determine if the sample mean is surprising. The standard
                    deviation in sample means is 500/(sqrt 36) = $83.33.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="0">
                <feedback>Not quite right. It is true that $2,940 is only $340 greater than
                    $2,600. It is also true that we expect to see variability in sample means.
                    However, to determine if $2,940 is surprising, verify that the Standard
                    Deviation Rule applies and then calculate how many standard deviations
                    $2,940 is from $2,600.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="D" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Since n = 36, the sample means will have an
                    approximately normal distribution. Use the hints.</feedback>
            </response>
            <hint>Since n = 36, the sample means will have an approximately normal distribution
                with mean $2,600 and standard deviation of 500/(sqrt 36). How many standard
                deviations is $2,940 above $2,600?</hint>
            <hint>$2,940 is more than 3 standard deviations above $2,600. (Three standard
                deviations above 2,600 is 2,600 + 3(500/6)) = 2,850.)</hint>
            <hint>Since the sample means are approximately normal, the Standard Deviation Rule
                predicts that approximately 99.7% of the sample means will fall within 3
                standard deviations of Âµ = 2,600. Samples means outside this range would be very
                unlikely.</hint>
