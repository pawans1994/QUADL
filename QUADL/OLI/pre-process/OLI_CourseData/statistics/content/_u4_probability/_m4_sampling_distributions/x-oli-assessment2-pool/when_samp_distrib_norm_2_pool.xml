            <p>Pictured below (in scrambled order) are three histograms. One of them represents a
                population distribution. The other two are sampling distributions of x-bar: one for
                sample size n = 5 and one for sample size n = 30. </p>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Although the mode on histogram 2 is located close to 0.5, this
                    does not indicate that the most likely value of the population mean is 0.5. The
                    Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that as the sample size n increases, the
                    sampling distribution of x-bar tends to a normal distribution with a mean equal
                    to the population mean. Keeping in mind the CLT, you should be using one of the
                    sampling distributions to find the most likely value of the population

                <feedback>Correct. We know that the sampling distribution of x-bar has mean Î¼, the
                    same as the population mean. Since we see from histogram 3 that the sampling
                    distribution of x-bar has a mean of approximately 3, this must also be the mean
                    in the population.</feedback>
