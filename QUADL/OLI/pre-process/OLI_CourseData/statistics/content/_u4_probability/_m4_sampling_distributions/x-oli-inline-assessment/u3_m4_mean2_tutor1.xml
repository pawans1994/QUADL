            <body>
                <p>If we randomly sample 36 Pell grant recipients and record
                    the mean Pell grant award for the sample, then repeat the sampling process many,
                    many times, what is the mean and standard deviation of the sample means? </p>

                <hint>The mean of the distribution of sample means will be &#956;. The standard
                    deviation will be &#963;/sqrt(n), where &#963; is the standard deviation of the
                    population.</hint>
                <hint>&#956; = 2,600, the average Pell grand for 2008. &#963; = 500, the standard
                    deviation in Pell grants for 2008. n = 36, the sample size.</hint>
                <explanation>The distribution of sample means will have a mean equal to &#956; =
                    2,600 and a standard deviation of <image
