         <p>What is the probability that the mean annual salary of a random sample of 64 teachers
               from this state is less than

            <p>Now we can use the central limit theorem. Even though the population distribution is skewed to the right, the sample size is large enough to guarantee that the Central Limit Theorem works regardless of the population distribution.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Limit Theorem, then, the mean has approximately a normal
                  distribution with the same mean as the population,
                  <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T195358-0500"?>$<?oxy_insert_end?>54,000,
                  and <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T195406-0500"?>a
                  <?oxy_insert_end?>standard
                  deviation<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T195409-0500"?>
                  of:<?oxy_insert_end?>
               </p>
            <image src="../../webcontent/flash/_u4_m4_lbdtutor4b_image1.jpg" alt="equation for standard deviation"/>
            <p>The z-score of 52,000 is therefore:</p>
            <image src="../../webcontent/flash/_u4_m4_lbdtutor4b_image2.jpg" alt="equation for Z score = -3.2"/>
            <p>And therefore,</p>
            <image src="../../webcontent/flash/_u4_m4_lbdtutor4b_image3.jpg" alt="equation for probability difference = .0007"/>
            <p>We find that while it is probably quite common to find teachers in this state with an
                  annual salary that is less than
                  <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T195426-0500"?>$<?oxy_insert_end?>52,000,
                  it would be extremely unusual for the mean salary of a sample of 64 teachers to be
                  less than
                  <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T195433-0500"?>$<?oxy_insert_end?>52,000.</p>
