      <body>
         <p>What is the probability that the mean annual salary of a random sample of 5 teachers
               from this state is more than

               Find this probability or explain why you cannot.</p>

                  unit that salary distribution is typically skewed to the right. Since 5 is a small
                  sample size, and the Central Limit Theorem does not guarantee that the sample mean
                  coming from a skewed population is approximately normal unless the sample size is
                  larger, we thus do not have enough information to solve the problem.</p>
