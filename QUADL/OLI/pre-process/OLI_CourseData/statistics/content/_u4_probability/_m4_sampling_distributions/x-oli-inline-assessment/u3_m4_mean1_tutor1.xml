                <p>In the simulation, when we are building a sampling distribution, what does each
                    dot represent in the graph? </p>

                    <feedback>Correct. Each sample is represented in the sampling distribution with

                <hint>Run the animation again and focus on the graph being built on top right.
                    Each dot represents a summary statistic of a sample of how many babies?
