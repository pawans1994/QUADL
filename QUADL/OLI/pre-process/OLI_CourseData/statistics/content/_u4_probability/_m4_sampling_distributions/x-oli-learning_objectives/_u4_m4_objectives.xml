    <title>Sampling Distributions</title>

    <objective id="distinguish_parameter_and_statistic" category="domain_specific">
        Identify and distinguish between a parameter and a statistic.
    </objective>

    <objective id="explain_sampling_variability" category="domain_specific">
        Explain the concepts of sampling variability and sampling distribution.
    </objective>

    <objective id="apply_sampling_distribution_of_sample_proportion" category="domain_specific">
        Apply the sampling distribution of the sample proportion (when appropriate).  In particular, be able to identify unusual samples from a given population.
    </objective>

    <objective id="apply_sampling_distribution_of_sample_mean" category="domain_specific">
        Apply the sampling distribution of the sample mean as summarized by the Central Limit Theorem (when appropriate).  In particular, be able to identify unusual samples from a given population.
