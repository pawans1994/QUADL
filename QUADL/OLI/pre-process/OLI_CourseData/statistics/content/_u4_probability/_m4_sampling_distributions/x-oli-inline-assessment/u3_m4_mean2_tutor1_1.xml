                <p>The population mean for Verbal IQ scores is 100, with a standard deviation of 15.
                    Suppose a researcher takes 50 random samples with 30 people in each sample.</p>
                <p>What is mean of the sample means?</p>

                    <feedback>Correct. The mean of the sample means is the population mean;
                        therefore, the mean of the sample means or the sampling distribution of the
                        mean is 100.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. This is the population standard deviation.

                        What is the standard deviation of the sample means? Please try
                        again.</feedback>

                <response match="B" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. The standard deviation of the sample means is calculated by
                        dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size;
                        therefore, Ïƒ/sqrt(n) = 15/sqrt(30)= 15/5.48= 2.74, which can also look like

                    <feedback>Incorrect. It looks like the number of samples rather
                        than the sample size was used for the denominator.</feedback>
