               <feedback>Correct. The probability of the z score of −3.21 using the Normal Table is
                  0.0007 or P(&lt;52,000) = P(z, −3.2) = (table) = 0.0007. Thus, we find that
                  while it is probably quite common to find teachers in this state with an annual
                  salary that is less than $52,000, it would be extremely unusual for the mean
                  salary of a sample of 64 teachers to be less than $52,000. </feedback>
