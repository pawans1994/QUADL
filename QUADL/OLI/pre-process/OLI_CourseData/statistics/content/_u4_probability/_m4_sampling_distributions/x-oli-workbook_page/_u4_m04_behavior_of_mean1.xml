                <example>
                    <p>Birth weights are recorded for all babies in a town. The mean birth weight is
                        3,500 grams, µ = 3,500 g. If we collect many random samples of 9 babies at a
                        time, how do you think sample means will behave? </p>
                    <p>Here again, we are working with a random variable, since random samples will
                        have means that vary unpredictably in the short run but exhibit patterns in
                        the long run. </p>
                    <p>Based on our intuition and what we have learned about the behavior of sample
                        proportions, we might expect the following about the distribution of sample
                        means: </p>
                    <p><em>Center</em>: Some sample means will be on the low side&#8212;say 3,000
                        grams or so&#8212;while others will be on the high side&#8212;say 4,000
                        grams or so. In repeated sampling, we might expect that the random samples
                        will average out to the underlying population mean of 3,500 g. In other
                        words, the mean of the sample means will be µ, just as the mean of sample
                        proportions was p. </p>
                    <p><em>Spread</em>: For large samples, we might expect that sample means will
                        not stray too far from the population mean of 3,500. Sample means lower than
                        3,000 or higher than 4,000 might be surprising. For smaller samples, we
                        would be less surprised by sample means that varied quite a bit from 3,500.
                        In others words, we might expect greater variability in sample means for
                        smaller samples. So sample size will again play a role in the spread of the
                        distribution of sample measures, as we observed for sample proportions. </p>
                    <p><em>Shape</em>: Sample means closest to 3,500 will be the most common, with
                        sample means far from 3,500 in either direction progressively less likely.
                        In other words, the shape of the distribution of sample means should bulge
                        in the middle and taper at the ends with a shape that is somewhat normal.
                        This, again, is what we saw when we looked at the sample proportions. </p>
                </example>
                <!--                <example>

                    <p>The "population" of all possible rolls X of a single die consists of the
                        numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, all occurring with equal probability of 1/6. We
                        already have found that the mean of this population is <m:math
                            overflow="scroll">
                            <m:mi>μ</m:mi>

                            <m:mn>3</m:mn>

                            <m:mn>5</m:mn>
                        </m:math> and the standard deviation is <m:math overflow="scroll">
                            <m:mi>σ</m:mi>
                            <m:mo>=</m:mo>
                            <m:mn>1</m:mn>
                            <m:mo>.</m:mo>
                            <m:mn>7</m:mn>
                        </m:math> (These can be found using the general formulas we introduced in
                        the Random Variables module.) What would you expect to see in terms of the behavior of the sample
                        mean roll <m:math overflow="scroll">
                            <m:mover accent="true">
                                <m:mrow>
                                    <m:mi>x</m:mi>
                                </m:mrow>
                                <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
                            </m:mover>
                        </m:math> if random samples of size 2 were taken from the population of all
                        rolls of a single die? In other words, if you rolled a die twice and
                        averaged the two results, and then repeated this many times (each time
                        recording the average you got), how would these averages behave?</p>
                    <p>Due to sampling variability, sample mean in random samples of size 2 will
                        take number values which vary according to the laws of chance: in other
                        words, sample mean is a <em>random variable.</em> To summarize the behavior
                        of any random variable, we focus on three features of its distribution: the
                        center, the spread, and the shape.</p>
                    <p>Based only on our intuition, we would expect the following:
                        (<em>Comment:</em> obviously, again we know what to expect, so it's not
                        really fair, but read along and try to see if the following makes intuitive
                        sense to you.)</p>
                    <p><em>Center</em>: some sample means will be on the low side - as low as
                        (1+1)/2=1 - while others will be on the high side - as high as (6+6)/2=6. It
                        is reasonable to expect all the sample means in repeated random samples to
                        average out to the underlying population mean, 3.5. In other words, the mean
                        of the distribution of <m:math overflow="scroll">
                            <m:mover accent="true">
                                <m:mrow>
                                    <m:mi>x</m:mi>
                                </m:mrow>
                                <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
                            </m:mover>
                        </m:math> should be <m:math overflow="scroll">
                            <m:mi>μ</m:mi>
                        </m:math>.</p>
                    <p><em>Spread</em>: for samples of 2, we would expect sample means to vary quite a bit,
                        with extremes like 1 or 6 not unheard of. On the other hand, if we were
                        taking samples of size 8, it would be virtually impossible (probability 1
                        over 6 to the 8th, which is less than 1 in a million) to get a sample mean
                        as low as 1 (all eight 1's) or a sample mean as high as 6 (all eight 6's).
                        Thus, sample size plays a role in the spread of the distribution of sample
                        mean: there should be less spread for larger samples, more spread for
                        smaller samples.</p>
                    <p><em>Shape</em>: sample means closest to 3.5 would be most common, and sample means far
                        from 3.5 in either direction would be progressively less likely. In other
                        words, the shape of the distribution of sample mean should be higher
                        in the middle and lower at the ends: it should be somewhat <em>normal.</em>
