         <response match="A" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct. This distribution has the largest spread relative to the mean, with
                  higher relative frequencies further from the mean than the other distributions. </feedback>
         </response>
         <response match="B">
            <feedback>Incorrect. This distribution has the second largest standard deviation. Look for a distribution with a lower relative frequency near the mean and higher relative frequencies further from the mean.</feedback>
         </response>
         <response match="C">
            <feedback>Incorrect. This distribution has the third largest standard deviation. Look for a distribution with the lowest relative frequency near the mean and higher relative frequencies further from the mean.</feedback>
         </response>
         <response match="D">
            <feedback>Incorrect. This distribution has the smallest standard deviation. It has the highest relative frequency near the mean, which makes the standard deviation small.</feedback>
         </response>
         <hint>The standard deviation is a measure of spread relative to the mean. Which distribution has lower relative frequencies near the mean and higher relative frequencies further from the mean?</hint>
