                        getting a score above it is 0.04. Equivalently (and more practically, given
                        the way our table works) we need to find the exam score such that the
                        probability of getting a score below it is 1 − 0.04 = 0.96. Looking in the
                        body of the table for the table entry that is closest to 0.96 (which is
                        0.9599) we learn that the exam score that we are looking for has a z-score
                        of 1.75. This means that the exam score that we are looking for is 1.75 * SD
                        above the mean, and therefore is: 75 + 1.75 * SD = 75 + 14 = 89. </feedback>
