         <p>What is the probability that a sample gives results within two standard deviations of
            the overall mean of 6.21? </p>

            <p> The mean ± 2 standard deviations = 6.21 ± 2(1.53) = 6.21 ± 3.06, which is a range from
               3.15 to 9.27. So samples with anywhere from 4 to 9 people out of the 10 supporting
               the death penalty will fall within two standard deviations of the mean. We can
               calculate the probability for samples with these results two ways: </p>
            <p> 1 – [P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3) + P(X=10)] = 1 – [0 + 0.001 + 0.007 + 0.031 + 0.009] = 0.952 </p>
            <p> OR </p>
            <p> By adding P(X=4) + P(X=5) + … + P(X=9) = 0.092 + 0.181 + 0.255 + 0.227 +
               0.142 + 0.053 = 0.950 </p>
            <p> The small discrepancy is due to rounding errors in the original table of values. </p>
            <p> So there is about a 95% probability that a sample will give results within two
               standard deviations of the overall mean of 6.21. Notice that this is the same as
               the probability of 0.95 predicted by the Standard Deviation Rule for normal
               distributions that we discussed in the unit on Exploratory Data Analysis. </p>
