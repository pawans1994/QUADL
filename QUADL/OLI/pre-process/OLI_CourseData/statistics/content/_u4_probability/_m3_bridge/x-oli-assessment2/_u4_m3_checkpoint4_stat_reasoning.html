						score above it is 0.04. Equivalently (and more practically, given the way
						our table works) we need to find the exam score such that the probability of
						getting a score below it is 1 – 0.04 = 0.96. Looking in the body of the
						table for the table entry that is closest to 0.96 (which is 0.9599) we learn
						that the exam score that we are looking for has a z-score of 1.75. This
						means that the exam score that we are looking for is 1.75 * SD above the
						mean, and therefore is: 75 + 1.75 * SD = 75 + 14 = 89. </feedback>
