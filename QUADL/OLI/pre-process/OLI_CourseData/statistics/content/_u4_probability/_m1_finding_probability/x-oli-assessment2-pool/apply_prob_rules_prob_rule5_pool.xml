                <feedback>Incorrect. If the probability were 0, then it would be impossible to
                    select two males. But it certainly is possible to select two males from the
                    college. Let M1 = (the first person is a male). Let M2 = (second person is a
                    male). We want P(M1 and M2). Because the population is fairly large, the events
                    are independent, and we can use the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events.

                <feedback>Incorrect. You may have added probabilities instead of using the
                    Multiplication Rule for Independent Events. The events are independent because
                    the population is fairly large. Let M1(the first person is a male). Let M2 =
                    (second person is a male). We want P(M1 and M2).</feedback>

            <response match="D" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. You may have interpreted the probability of selecting two males
                    as the complement of selecting two females, but the complement of two females is
                    equivalent to (at least one male). Because the population is fairly large, the
                    events are independent, and we can use the Multiplication Rule for Independent
                    Events.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. You are correct that there are four possible outcomes:
                    male-male, male-female, female-male, and female-female. However, they are not
                    all equally likely, since P(male) ≠ P(female) ≠ 0.50. So P(two males) is not
                    1/4 = 0.25. Because the population is fairly large, the events are independent,
                    and we can use the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events. </feedback>
