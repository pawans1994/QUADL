            <p>In the population, 8% of males have had a kidney stone. Suppose a medical researcher

            <p>Let B represent the event "the second male has had a kidney stone."</p>
            <p>True or false? A and B are independent events.</p>

            <p>In 2012, researchers working with a very large population of health records found
                that 9.3% of all Americans had diabetes (source: National Diabetes Statistics
                Report, 2014). Suppose a medical researcher randomly selects two individuals from a
                large population.</p>
