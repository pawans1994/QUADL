<title>Basic Probability Rules</title>
<body>
<p>In the previous section we considered situations in which all the possible outcomes of
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T103625-0500"?>a<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T103624-0500" content="the"?>
                    random experiment are equally likely, and learned a simple way to find the
                    probability of any event in this special case. We are now moving on to learn how
                    to find the probability of events in the general case (when the possible
                    outcomes are not necessarily equally likely), using five basic probability
                    rules. Fortunately, these basic rules of probability are very intuitive, and as
                    long as they are applied
                    systematically<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T103707-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    they will let us solve more complicated problems; in particular, those problems
                    for which our intuition might be inadequate.</p>

<p>This first rule
            <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T103847-0500" content="is not a very practical one, but "?>simply
            reminds us of the basic property of probability

            we've already learned. The probability of an event, which informs us of the likelihood
            of it occurring, can range anywhere from 0 (indicating that the event will never occur)
            to 1 (indicating that the event is certain). One

            will provide a context for illustrating the next several rules.</p>
<example>

<p>As previously discussed, all human blood can be typed as O, A, B<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T104319-0500" content=","?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T111911-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>or AB. In addition, the frequency of
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T104326-0500"?>the occurrence
                of <?oxy_insert_end?>these blood types varies by ethnic and racial groups. According
                to
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T104341-0500" content="the "?>Stanford
                University's Blood Center (<link href="http://bloodcenter.stanford.edu" target="new"
                    >bloodcenter.stanford.edu</link>), these are the probabilities of human blood
                types in the United
                States<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T104439-0500" content=":"?>
                (the probability for type A has been omitted on
                purpose)<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T104442-0500"?>:<?oxy_insert_end?></p>

<p>.</p>
<p>
                <em>Motivating question for rule 2:</em> A person in the
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T104506-0500"?>United
                States<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T104505-0500" content="U.S."?>
                is chosen at random. What is the probability of the person having blood type A?</p>
<p>
                <em>Answer:</em> Our intuition tells us that since the four blood types O, A, B, and
                AB exhaust all the possibilities, their probabilities together must sum to 1, which
                is the probability of a
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T104556-0500"?>"<?oxy_insert_end?>certain<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T104553-0500"?>"<?oxy_insert_end?>
                event (a person has one of these 4 blood types for certain). Since the probabilities
                of O, B, and AB together sum to .44 + .1 + .04 = .58, the probability of type A must
                be the remaining .42 (1 - .58 = .42):</p>

            our second rule, which tells us
            <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T105157-0500" comment="Just to be sure ...

Above it said this was true of the probabilities of a &quot;certain&quot; event. Should that qualifier be added into the wording of this rule, also? (In other words, is there never a situation where you are dealing with an &quot;uncertain&quot; event?)

<p>This is a good place to compare and contrast what we're doing here with what we learned in the
                    E<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T105901-0500"?>xploratory
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>D<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T105908-0500"?>ata
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>A<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T105912-0500"?>nalysis
                    (EDA)<?oxy_insert_end?> section. Notice that in this problem we are essentially
                    focusing on a single categorical
                    variable<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T105928-0500"?>:<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T105927-0500" content=","?>
                    blood type. We summarized this variable above, as we summarized single
                    categorical variables in the
                    E<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T110012-0500" content="xploratory "?>D<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T110015-0500" content="ata "?>A<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T110018-0500" content="nalysis"?>
                    section, by listing what values the variable takes and how often it takes them.
                    In EDA we used
                    percentages<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T110035-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    and here we're using probabilities, but the two convey the same information. In
                    the EDA section, we learned that a pie<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T110109-0500"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T110109-0500" content="-"?>chart
                    provides an appropriate display when a single categorical variable is involved,
                    and similarly we can use it here (using percentages instead of
                    probabilities):</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image012.gif" alt="A pie chart, titled &quot;Blood Types.&quot;
Type O takes up 44% of the pie chart, A uses 42%, AB represents 4%, and B represents the rest, 10%."/>
<p>Even though what we're doing here is indeed similar to what we've done in the EDA section, there
                    is a subtle but important difference between the underlying situations in this
                    section and the ones
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T110204-0500"?>in<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T110203-0500" content="from"?>
                    the Exploratory Data Analysis section. In EDA, we summarized data that were
                    obtained from a <em>sample</em> of individuals for whom values of the variable
                    of interest were recorded. Here, when we present the frequency, or
                    probability<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T110239-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    of each blood type, we have in mind the entire <em>population</em> of people in
                    the <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T110250-0500"?>United
                    States<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T110248-0500" content="US"?>,
                    for which we are presuming to know the overall frequency of values taken by the
                    variable of interest.</p>
