        <p>We are now moving to rule 4, which deals with another situation of frequent interest,
            finding P(A <em>or</em> B), the probability of one event <em>or</em> another occurring.
            Before we get to the actual rule, however, we need some clarifications and
            definitions.</p>
        <p>When a parent says to
            his<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T120153-0500"?> or
            <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T120153-0500" content="/"?>her
            child in a toy store "Do you want toy A or toy B?", this means that the child is going
            to get only one toy and
            he<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T120205-0500"?> or
            <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T120204-0500" content="/"?>she
            has to choose between them. Getting both toys is usually not an option.</p>
        <p>In contrast, </p>
        <p>
            <em> In
                probability<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T120231-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                "OR" means either one or the other or both.</em>
        </p>
        <p>and so, </p>
        <p>
            <em> P(A or B) = P(event A occurs or event B occurs or both occur)</em>
        </p>
        <p>Having said that, it should be noted that there are some cases where it is simply
            impossible for the two events to both occur at the same time, in which case we don't
            have to worry about the possibility that both occur when we
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T120306-0500"?>try<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T120304-0500" content="come"?>
            to find P(A or B). The distinction between events that can happen together and those
            that cannot is an important one.</p>

                Therefore, <?oxy_insert_end?>it is impossible for the events A and B to occur
                together.</p>

            <p>
                <em>Definition:</em> Two events that cannot occur at the same time are called
                    <em>disjoint</em> or <em>mutually exclusive.</em> (We will use disjoint.)</p>
            <p>We can therefore say that in the first example events A and B are disjoint, and in
                the second example they are not disjoint. Using Venn diagrams, we can visualize two
                events
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T122135-0500"?>that<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T122133-0500" content="which"?>
                are disjoint and compare them to two events
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T122151-0500"?>that<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T122152-0500" content="which"?>
                are not:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image015.gif" alt="A Venn diagram titled
&quot;A and B are Disjoint.&quot; The entire sample space is represented as a rectangle.
Inside the rectangle are two separate circles. One circle represents the events in A and
the other represents the events in B."/>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image016.gif" alt="A Venn diagram titled
&quot;A and B are NOT Disjoint.&quot; The entire sample space is represented as a rectangle.
Inside the rectangle are two circles. One circle represents the occurrences in A and
the other represents the occurrences in B. These two are not disjoint, so the two circles
partially overlap each other. (Being NOT disjoint, two circles could overlap each
other completely, but in this example they do not.)"/>
        </example>
        <p>The Venn diagrams suggest that another way to think about disjoint versus not disjoint
            events is that disjoint events <em>do not overlap</em>. They do not share any of the
            possible outcomes, and therefore cannot happen together. On the other hand, events
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T122235-0500"?>that<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T122233-0500" content="which"?>
            are not disjoint are overlapping in the sense that they share some of the possible
            outcomes and therefore can occur at the same time.

        <p>Now that we understand the idea of disjoint events, we can finally get to rule 4. Rule 4
            actually has two versions, one for finding P(A or B) in the special case

            events A and B are disjoint, and a more general version for when the events are not
            necessarily disjoint. We will first present the version of rule 4 that is restricted to
            disjoint events, and later in the module (after rule 5)
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T125424-0500"?>we will revisit
