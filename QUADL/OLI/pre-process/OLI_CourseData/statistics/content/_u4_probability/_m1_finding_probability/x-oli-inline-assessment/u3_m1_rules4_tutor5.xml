				<response match="A" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. 0.085 is the probability that a randomly selected
						adult attended high school but did not graduate. The event “has not
						graduated from high school” is composed of two outcomes from the table.
					</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="B" score="10">
					<feedback>Correct. P(has not graduated from high school) = P(“no high school”
						or “some high school”) = 0.063 + 0.085 = 0.148. We can add these
						probabilities since the events “no high school” and “some high school” are
						disjoint. These events are disjoint because the table describes the highest
						level of educational attainment for an individual.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="C" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. The events “no high school” and “some high school”
						are disjoint because the table describes the <em style="italic">highest</em> level of educational
						attainment. </feedback>
