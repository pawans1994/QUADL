        <p>Now that we know how to build a two-way probability table, let's see how we can use
            information from it to solve problems.</p>
        <example>

            <p>Let's go back to our delivery example and see how we can "lift" probabilities from
                the two-way probability table in order to answer the question posed in that example
                and related questions. Here is the table again:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image033.gif" alt="The table has 3 columns and 3
rows. The columns are: &quot;B,&quot; &quot;not B,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; The rows are &quot;A,&quot;
&quot;not A,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; Here is the cell data in &quot;Row, Column: Value&quot; format.
            A,B: 0.75;
            A,not B: .15;
            A,Total: .90;
            not A, B: .05;
            not A, not B: .05;
            not A, Total: .10;
            Total, B: .80;
            Total, not B: .20;
            Total, Total: 1.00"/>
            <p>What is the probability of on-time delivery of the document using the two services
                strategy? </p>
            <p> In other words, what is P(A or B)?</p>
            <p> We can use the table in two ways:</p>
            <p> (i) We can simply lift P(A), P(B) and P(A and B) from the table as shown in the
                table below and use the General Addition Rule to get 0.95. as we did
                before:
                P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A and B) = 0.90 + 0.80 − 0.75 = 0.95.</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image034.gif" alt="Cells
are given in &quot;{Row,Column: Value}&quot; format. The same table as the previous,
except that the cells {A,B: 0.75}, {A, Total: 0.90}, and {Total, B: 0.80} have been
highlighted."/>
            <p> (ii) Another way to use the table is to use the fact that in probability, "A or B"
                actually means "A or B or both." The corresponding cells for these three options are
                shaded below and are 0.15 (only A), 0.05 (only B), and 0.75 (both). We can add these up
                to get P(A or B) = 0.95.</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image035.gif" alt="Cells
are given in &quot;{Row,Column}&quot; format. The same table as the previous,
except that the cells {A,B: 0.75}, {A, not B: 0.15}, and {not A, B: 0.05} have been
highlighted."/>
        </example>
        <example>

            <p>What is the probability of on-time delivery by exactly one service? </p>
            <p> On-time delivery by exactly one service occurs if the document arrives on-time by
                service A and not B, or by service B and not A. The probabilities of these two
                possibilities are represented by the shaded cells in the table below, and are 0.15
                and 0.05 respectively. Therefore, P(on-time delivery by exactly one service) = 0.15 +
                0.05 = 0.20</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image036.gif" alt="Cells
are given in &quot;{Row,Column}&quot; format. The same table as the previous,
except that the cells {A, not B: 0.15} and {not A, B: 0.05} have been highlighted."/>
        </example>
        <example>

            <p>What is the probability that the document will <em>not</em> get to its destination on
                time? This would be the occurrence of the event "not A and not B," whose probability
                is 0.05, as shown in the table:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image037.gif" alt="Cells
are given in &quot;{Row,Column}&quot; format. The same table as the previous,
except that the cell {not A, not B: 0.05} has been highlighted."/>
        </example>

        <p>We are now done with this section, which introduced various probability rules. Let's
            summarize what we've learned.</p>
        <p>1. The Complement Rule states that</p>
        <p>
            <em>P(not A) = 1 − P(A)</em>
        </p>
        <p> or when rearranged</p>
        <p>
            <em>P(A) = 1 − P(not A).</em>
        </p>
        <!--   <p> The latter representation of the Complement Rule is especially useful when we need to
            find probabilities of complicated events of the sort "at least one of<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T005725-0500"?>
            <?oxy_insert_end?>..."</p>-->
        <p>The Complement Rule is very useful when we need to find probabilities of the sort: P(At
            least one of several events occur) which is hard to calculate. In this case, we apply the Complement Rule:</p>
        <p><em>P(At least one of several events occur) = 1 − P(None of the events occur)</em>, since P(None of the events occur) is usually much easier to find.</p>
        <p>2. The General Addition Rule states that for any two events,</p>
        <p>
            <em>P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A and B),</em>
        </p>
        <p>where, by P(A or B) we mean P(A occurs or B occurs or both).</p>
        <p>In the special case when A and B are <em style="italic">disjoint</em> events (which means that
            P(A and B) = 0), the general addition rule becomes P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B), which we call the
            Addition Rule for Disjoint Events.</p>
        <p>Beware of wrongly using the Addition Rule for Disjoint events when the events are not
            disjoint.</p>
        <p>3. When we want to find P(A and B), we can use the Multiplication Rule, but so far we've
            only learned the restricted version of this rule&#8212;the Multiplication Rule for
                Independent Events. Events are independent if the occurrence of one of the
            events has no effect on the probability of the other occurring, in which case:</p>
        <p>
            <em>P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).</em>
        </p>
        <p>4. The Additional Rule for Disjoint Events can be naturally extended to more than two
            events. In other words, if events A, B, and C are disjoint, then</p>
        <p>P(A or B or C)=P(A)+P(B)+P(C). </p>
        <p>Similarly, the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events can be naturally extended to
            more than two independent events. In other words, if events A, B, and C are independent,
            then P(A and B and C) = P(A) * P(B) * P(C). The same is true for 4, 5, ...,
            disjoint/independent events.</p>

        <p>5. When there are two categorical variables in the background, each with two possible
            values, a <em style="italic">two-way probability table</em> is a quick and easy way to display the
                probabilities associated with the 4 possible combinations.</p>
