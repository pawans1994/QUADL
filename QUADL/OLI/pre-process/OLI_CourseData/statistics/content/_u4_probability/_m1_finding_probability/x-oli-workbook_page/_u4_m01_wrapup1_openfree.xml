        <p>So far in our study of
            probability<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010423-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            you have <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010425-0500"?>been
            <?oxy_insert_end?>introduced to the sometimes counterintuitive nature of probability and
            the fundamentals that underlie
            probability<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010433-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            such as a random
            experiment<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010508-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>,

            and relative frequency. We also gave you some tools to help you find
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010522-0500"?>the
            <?oxy_insert_end?>probabilities of

            the probability rules. You probably noticed that the probability section
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010928-0500"?>was<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010927-0500" content="is"?>
            significantly different from the two previous <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010907-0500"?>sections<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010905-0500" content="ones"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010745-0500"?>;<?oxy_insert_end?>

            the results tend to be more of the "right or wrong" nature. In the Exploratory Data
            Analysis section, for the most
            part<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010948-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            the computer took care of the technical aspect of things, and our tasks were to tell it
            to do the right thing and then interpret the results. In
            probability<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T011000-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            we do the work from beginning to end, from choosing the right tool (rule) to use,
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T011036-0500"?>to
            <?oxy_insert_end?>using it correctly,

            interpreting the results. Finally, we have one piece of unfinished business left from
            this module. We have only discussed the version of the
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T011157-0500"?>M<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T011156-0500" content="m"?>ultiplication

            is restricted to independent events and we still need to lift this restriction and
            introduce the
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T011246-0500"?>G<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T011245-0500" content="g"?>eneral

            This will be done in the next module.</p>
