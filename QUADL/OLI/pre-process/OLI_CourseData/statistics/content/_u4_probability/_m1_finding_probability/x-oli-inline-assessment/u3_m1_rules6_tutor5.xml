			<body>In the 2000 presidential election, George Bush won 48% of the popular vote. In the
				2004 presidential election, he won 51% of the popular vote. What is the probability
				that a randomly chosen voter voted for Bush in both elections? </body>
			<short_answer id="A"/>
			<part>
				<response input="A" match="*" score="10"/>
				<hint>Let A be the event that the person voted for Bush in 2000. Let B be the event
					that the person voted for Bush in 2004. We want to find P(A and B), but P(A and
					B)=P(A)*P(B) ONLY IF the events A and B are independent.</hint>
				<hint>Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the
					probability that the other event occurs. If an individual voted for Bush in
					2000, do you think that affects the probability that this person voted for Bush
					in 2004?</hint>
				<explanation>Let A be the event that the person voted for Bush in 2000. Let B be the
					event that the person voted for Bush in 2004. The question asks us to determine
					P(A and B). We might be tempted to use the Multiplication Rule for Independent
					Events and write P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B) = 0.48*0.51 = 0.2448, but this would be
					incorrect because these events are not independent. If an individual voted for
					Bush in 2000, it is likely that the individual voted for him in 2004. So we are
					unable to answer the question with the information given. </explanation>
