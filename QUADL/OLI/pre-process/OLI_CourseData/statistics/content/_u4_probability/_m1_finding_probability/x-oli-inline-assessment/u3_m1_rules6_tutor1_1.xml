            <!--LO:LO: Apply probability rules in order to find the likelihood of an event.  Sub-objective: rule5        Probability rule 5    -->
            <body><p>A 2011 poll by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press estimated that
                    62% of U.S. adults favor the death penalty for persons convicted of murder, 31%
                    oppose it, with the remaining 7% undecided.</p>
                <p>What is the probability that two randomly chosen U.S. adults support the death
                    penalty for persons convicted of murder?</p></body>

                <response input="A" match="*" score="10"/>
                <explanation><p>Let A be the event that the first person supports the death penalty.
                        Let B be the event that the second person supports the death penalty. </p>
                    <p>We want to find P(A and B). Since the two people are chosen at random from a
                        large population, A and B are independent and we can use the Multiplication
                        Rule for Independent Events.</p>
                    <p>P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.62 * 0.62 = 0.3844</p></explanation>
