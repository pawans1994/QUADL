        <p>Here is a more interesting example:</p>
        <example>

            <p>A certain college recently announced
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T095725-0500"?>2<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T095723-0500" content="two"?>
                job openings in its admissions office. From all the applicants, a search committee
                identified
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T095732-0500"?>5<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T095730-0500" content="five"?>

                men and

                seemed equally qualified. Priding itself on a long history as an equal opportunity
                employer, the college would like to continue that tradition and make the
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T095755-0500" content="two"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T095756-0500"?>2<?oxy_insert_end?>
                appointments at random. The college's legal department, though, has cautioned the
                personnel office that
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T103434-0500"?>doing
                so<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T103431-0500" content="that"?>
                may not be a good idea. If the
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T095801-0500" content="two"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T095803-0500"?>2<?oxy_insert_end?>
                chosen happen to be of the same gender, the selection process will seem to be
                discriminatory, and the college may become embroiled in expensive litigation. What
                is the probability that the random selection will
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T095238-0500"?>result in both
                chosen candidates having the same gender, and will thus <?oxy_insert_end?>appear to
                be discriminatory? We'll denote this event by D (for discriminatory).</p>
            <p>Let's identify the

            <p>Note that

                because 2 candidates are being chosen and they are listed in S as pairs,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T095534-0500" content="and so "?>once
                we've included (M1,<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T095541-0500"?>

                <?oxy_insert_end?>M1). Both represent the same outcome: M1 and M2 are the two that

                    say, 10 (instead of 5), the number of possible outcomes would grow substantially
                    (from 10 to 45) and listing all of those outcomes would be quite

                <p>It is important to note that it is not always the case the all the outcomes of a
                    random experiment are equally likely.</p>
                <p>A common mistake among students who are exposed to probability for the first time
                    is to assume that all the outcomes of a random experiment are equally likely
                    when in fact they are not.</p>
                <p>Here is an example.</p>

            </body>
        </section>
        <example>
            <p>A fair coin is tossed repeatedly until the first ‘H’ is obtained but no more than
                three times. In this experiment there are four possible outcomes: Getting ‘H’ in the
                first toss, getting the first ‘H’ in the second toss, getting the first ‘H’ in the
                third toss, or tossing the coin three times without getting a ‘H’. The sample space
                in this case is therefore:</p>
            <image src="../webcontent/fair_coin.png" alt="The sample space is {H, TH, TTH, TTT}."></image>
            <p>As mentioned above, a common mistake is to wrongly assume that the four outcomes are
                equally likely, each with probability ¼.</p>
            <p>Note that the first outcomes ‘H’ has probability ½ (since it represents the outcome
                of tossing the fair coin once and getting ‘H’). If the first outcome has probability
                ½, it is clear that the outcomes cannot be equally likely since the sum of the
                probabilities of all outcomes must be 1.</p>

        </example>

            <body>
                <p>In the special case when all the outcomes of a random experiment are equally
                    likely, there is a simple way to calculate the probability of any event by
                    counting how many of the outcomes satisfy or make up the event, and dividing it
                    by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.</p>

        <p>Remember, it is not always the case that the outcomes are equally likely, so make sure to
            check if they are before applying this method to calculate probabilities. In the next
            modules you’ll learn other methods which will help you compute probabilities more
            generally. </p>
