            <p>Roughly 7% of American males in U.S. have some sort of color blindness.</p>

                    blind’.</em></p>

                <feedback>Correct. These events are disjoint because they cannot occur at the same
                    time. An individual male cannot be both color blind and not color blind.

                    The occurrence (or not) of event A will affect the probability of B. If A
