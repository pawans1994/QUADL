            answer the following:</p>
         <p>i. What are the possible outcomes for each of these events? </p>
         <p>ii. Do the events share any of the outcomes? (i.e., is there an overlap between the two
            events?) </p>
         <p>iii. Based on ii, are the events disjoint or not?</p>
