            <p>According to the information that comes with a certain prescription drug, when taking
                this drug, there is a 20% chance of experiencing nausea (N) and a 50% chance of
                experiencing decreased sexual drive (D). The information also states that there is a
                15% chance of experiencing both side effects. </p>
            <p>What is the probability of experiencing nausea <em style="italic">or</em> a decrease

                    need to find P(N or D). Using the General Addition Rule: P(N or D) = P(N) + P(D)

                    you added these three probabilities. This is incorrect because P(N and D) is

                    both event A and event B. If we did not subtract the P(A and B), the answer
                    would be 1, which we know is not true because the number 4 appears in neither
