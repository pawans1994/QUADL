      <p>Candace is applying to two colleges, Ross College and the more prestigious Cirus College.
         The probability table below represents her belief about whether she will be accepted. We
         use the following notation:</p>
      <p>R&#8212;the event of being accepted to Ross College</p>
      <p>C&#8212;the event of being accepted to Cirus College</p>

         <p>What does Candace believe is the probability that she'll be accepted to both

            <feedback> Correct. Since we are using a probability table, the most obvious approach
               is to think of the sample space of the event "accepted by at least one of the
               colleges" as {R and C, R and "not C", "not R" and C}, which are disjoint events. So
               add 0.38 + 0.37 + 0.02 = 0.77. Another strategy views "accepted by at least one of
               the colleges" as the complement of the event ("not R" and "not C"). Using the
               complement rule, 1 − P("not R" and "not C") = 1 − 0.23 = 0.77. You can also use the
               General Addition Rule: P(R) + P(C) − P(R and C) = 0.75 + 0.40 − 0.38 =
               0.77.</feedback>
         </response>
         <response match="Res2" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. The probability cannot be 1 because there is one outcome in
               the table that is not in the sample space for the event "accepted by at least one
               college."</feedback>

         <response match="Res3" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. 0.38 is P(R and C), the probability that she gets into both

               space for the event "accepted to at least one college." What other outcomes will be
               part of the sample space?</feedback>
         </response>
         <response match="Res4" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. The probability of an event can never be greater than 1. You
               may have tried to calculate the probability of "Ross College or Cirus College or
               both" by adding P(R) + P(C) + P(R and C). This is incorrect since P(R and C) is
               included in the other two probabilities. Recall that "or" statements with events that
               are not disjoint require use of the General Addition Rule. </feedback>
