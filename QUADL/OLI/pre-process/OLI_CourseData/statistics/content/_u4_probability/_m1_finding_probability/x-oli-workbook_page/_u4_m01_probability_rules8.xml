                <p>Recall that when we talked about the Complement Rule, we mentioned that we would
                    come back to it later and illustrate its strength. Well, the time has come
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T213200-0500"?>to
                    do<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T213159-0500" content="for"?>
                    that.</p>

                    <?oxy_insert_end?>The Complement Rule<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T213301-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T213250-0500" content="(Rule 3:"?>
                    P(A) = 1 - P(not
                    A)<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T213306-0500" content=")"?>,
                    together with the Multiplication Rule, is <em>extremely</em> useful for finding
                    the probability of events like "at least one of<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T213345-0500"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>..." in several repetitions of a random experiment.</p>
                <p>For example,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>10 people were randomly chosen. Find P(at least one of the 10 has blood type
                        O).</li>
                    <li>A student uses a random guess to answer 10 true/false questions
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T213425-0500"?>o<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T213424-0500" content="i"?>n
                        a test. Find P(the student gets at least one question right).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The key here is to use the fact that the complement event is much easier to deal
                    with than the actual event of interest. Going back to our example:</p>
                <p>The complement to <em>"at least one of</em> the 10 has blood type O" is
                        <em>"none</em> of the 10
                    ha<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T213614-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T213613-0500" content="ve"?>
                    blood type O."</p>
                <p>The complement to "getting <em>at least one</em> question right" is "getting
                        <em>none</em> of the questions right."</p>
                <p>(Note how "at least one of" changes to "none" in the complement.)</p>
                <p>If you feel unsure about this, go back and redo the "Did I Get This" activity

                <p>We'll start with a very simple example

                    directly, without using the complement rule. Then we'll alter the example
                    slightly and see how trying to find P(at least one of<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T214040-0500"?>

                    the rescue. Finally, you'll check your understanding by attempting to solve a

        <p>Now we'll just alter the example slightly by randomly choosing 10 people instead of

        <example>

            <p>A patient with blood type O desperately needs a blood transfusion. Since a person
                with blood type O can receive blood only from another person who has blood type O,
                the blood bank decides to choose 10 donors at random and hope that at least one of
                them has blood type O. Find P(at least one of the 10 donors has blood type O). To
                make things simpler, let's denote the event "at least one has blood type O" by L
                (for at <em>L</em>east).</p>
            <p>Solving this

                the brute force method would require a prohibitive amount of work. As before, we
                would need to list all the possible outcomes of blood types of 10 people (using
                either "O" or "not
                O"<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T214910-0500" content=" as before"?>),

                of them! We would then need to identify those outcomes that L consists of (i.e., the
                outcomes in which at least one of the 10 people has blood type O). Next, we would
                need to find the probability of each of those outcomes and add those probabilities
                up. <em>W<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T215004-0500"?>hat a

                says P(L) = 1 - P(not L). As we explained before, in this case "not L" is the event
                "none of the 10 have blood type O," or in other words that all 10 have a blood type
                other than O. So we can simply solve (using our regular notation from this
                module):</p>

                    questions, each with 4 possible answers, only one of which is correct. A student
                    who does not attend lectures on a regular basis has no

                    guess to answer each of the 10 questions. What is the probability that the
                    student gets at least one question right?</p>
                <p>Let's decide on some notations.</p>
                <p>Let L be the event that the student gets at least one of the questions right.</p>
                <p>We'll use R for getting a question right and W for getting it wrong (W is
                    essentially "not R").</p>
