            <p>Four students attempt to register online at the same time for an Introductory
                Statistics class that is full. Two are freshmen and two are sophomores. They are put
                on a wait list. Prior to the start of the semester, two enrolled students drop the
                course, so the professor decides to randomly select two of the four wait list
                students and gives them a seat in the class. </p>
