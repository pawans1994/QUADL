        <p>So far we have looked at examples where we have to consider and apply only one of the
            rules. The following example is a case where both the Addition Rule for Disjoint Events
            and the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events need to be applied in order to find
            the desired probability.</p>
        <example>

            <p>Recall the blood types example:</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image011.gif" alt="Data given in &quot;Blood Type:

            <p>Two people are chosen
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T193053-0500"?>simultaneously
                and <?oxy_insert_end?>at random. What is the probability that both have the same
                blood type? For both to have the same blood type there are four possibilities. Both
                have blood type O <em>or</em> both have blood type A <em>or</em> both have blood
                type B <em>or</em> both have blood type AB.</p>
            <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image023.gif" alt="A diagram showing the four
possibilities."/>
            <p> In other words, and using our regular notations,</p>
            <p> P(same blood type) = P([O1 and O2]
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T193027-0500"?>or<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T193024-0500" content="OR"?>

                [AB1 and AB2])</p>
            <p>Since our four possibilities of both

                <?oxy_insert_end?>having

                blood type are <em>disjoint</em>, using our <em>Addition Rule</em> we can add their
                probabilities (i.e., replace every
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T193656-0500"?>"<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T193657-0500" content="OR"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T193659-0500"?>or"<?oxy_insert_end?>

                within each of the four possibilities, we can use the <em>Multiplication Rule</em>
                and replace
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T193749-0500"?>"and"

                * (using the same <em>independence</em> argument as the first example

                this page). Our answer is therefore,</p>

                P(AB and AB) = .04 * .04
                P(Both having the same blood type) = P(O and O) + P(A and A) + P(B and B) + 
P(AB and AB) = 0.3816"/>
            <p>About 38% of the time, two randomly chosen

                <?oxy_insert_end?>people would have the same blood type. Note that in this example
                we used the Addition Rule and the Multiplication Rule one after the other,
                justifying along the way why it is appropriate to do so.</p>

                <!--  <p>We now have an Addition Rule that says</p>
                <p> P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) for <em>disjoint</em> events,</p>

                <p>The purpose of this comment is to point out the magnitude of P(A or B) and of P(A
                    and B) relative to either one of the individual probabilities. Since
                    probabilities are never negative, the probability of one event <em>or</em>
                    another is always at least as large as either of the individual probabilities.
                    Since probabilities are never more than 1, the probability of one event
                        <em>and</em> another generally involves multiplying numbers that are less
                    than 1,
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T194211-0500"?>therefore
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T194216-0500" content="and "?>can
                    never be more than either of the individual probabilities.</p>
                <p>Here is an example:</p>
                <example>

                    and the resulting probability is smaller than either one of the individual
