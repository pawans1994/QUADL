            <p>Our answer: P(among the top three
               <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T135209-0500"?>favorite
               <?oxy_insert_end?>colors) = P(Silver or White or Black).</p>
            <p>Since the three events, Silver, White and Black, are disjoint (since

               of our example <?oxy_insert_end?>a car can have just one color), we can apply the

The fact that all colors (and thus all cars) are not included, presents multiple problems. You can&apos;t say &quot;the probability of any random car,&quot; because only cars that are one of the 10 favorite colors are considered. In this problem, you are talking about the top three favorites among the tep ten favorites, which is confusing. I have rewritten the above to be accurate, but note that in this last statement, you cannot actually specify what 50.2 is a percentage of. Because of the way Dupont characterized the study, it&apos;s not a percentage of cars, either manufactured or owned. It&apos;s not a percentage of colors. We have no way of knowing how they determined popularity, so we can&apos;t even say it&apos;s the percentage of &quot;responses&quot; to the question &quot;Out of these 10 car colors, which one is the most popular?&quot;. 50.2 is kind of the percentage of popularity of the top three of the top ten favorite car colors in the United States in 2003 according to Dupont."?>In
