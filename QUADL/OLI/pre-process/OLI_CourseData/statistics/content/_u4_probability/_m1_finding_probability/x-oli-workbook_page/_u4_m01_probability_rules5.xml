        <p>Rule 4, the addition rule, deals with finding P(A <em>or</em> B). We are now moving on to
            rule 5, which deals with yet another situation of frequent interest, finding P(A
                <em>and</em> B), the probability that both events A and B occur. In other words,</p>
        <p>
            <em>P(A and B) = P(event A occurs and event B occurs)</em>
        </p>
        <p>For example, we might be interested in the probability that if two people are chosen at
            random, both the first has blood type O <em>and</em> the second has blood type O. Since
            a person with blood type O can donate blood to anyone, this probability might be of
            particular interest in this context.</p>
        <p>Using a Venn diagram, we can visualize "A and B," which is represented by the overlap
            between events A and B:</p>
        <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image019.gif" alt="A rectangle represents the entire
sample space. Inside this rectangle are two circles, one for the occurrences in A and one for the occurrences
in B. These two circles partially overlap. The area in the overlap contains the ocurrences for A and B."/>

                <p>There is one special case for which we know what P(A and B) equals without

        <p>So, if events <em style="bold">A and B are disjoint</em>, then (by definition) <em

                since we know that eye color is hereditary, so whether
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T154313-0500"?>or not

Alternatively, you could specify that you are re-insterting the first person back into the population before making your second choice.

Saying that the population is &quot;very large&quot; makes the mathematical effect of the removal of one member of the population minimal, but it does not eliminate it. 

I think that not including one or the other of these qualifiers will confuse students, because if you do not, this example contradicts the one about coins in your pocket. The only difference is that there the population is 4, and here it is millions.

On page 7 of probability rules, I have suggested a place to insert a comment about how it is OK to assume that events are independent in very large populations because of the negligible mathematical consequences. I recommend placing that comment there, rather than here, to give students a chance to get used to the difference between dependent and independent events before adding a &quot;special case.&quot; In between here and there, I have recommended changing wording to &quot;simultaneously and at random or adding &quot;with replacement.&quot;

        <p>We can generalize what we learned in the last example and say that when two individuals
            are selected at random from a large population (like in the example, the entire U.S.)
            any event associated with one individual is independent of any event associated with the
            other individual. The fact that the two are chosen from a large population is key to the
            independence.</p>

        <p>If we were to change the example to: There are 10 people in a room, 4 of which have blue
            eyes. Two people are chosen at random. Let B1 be the event that the first person has
            blue eyes and let B2 be the event that the second person has blue eyes. In this case,
            since the two are chosen from a group of only 10 (rather than a large population) the
            events B1 and B2 are not independent. Clearly, whether or not the first person has blue
            eyes (i.e., whether or not B1 occurs) does have an effect on whether B2 occurs. You will
            get more practice on this point in the activities below the next comment. </p>

                <p>It is quite common for students to initially get confused about the distinction
                    between the idea of <em>disjoint events</em> and the idea of <em>independent
                        events</em>. The purpose of this comment (and the activity that follows it)
                    is to help students develop more understanding about

                <p>The idea of <em>disjoint events</em> is about whether or not it is possible for

                <p>Why did we leave out the case when the events are disjoint and independent? The

                    that’s the case, knowing that event A has occurred dramatically changes the
                    likelihood that event B occurs – that likelihood is <m:math display = 'inline'>

                    </m:math>. This implies that A and B

        <p>Now that we understand the idea of independent events, we can finally get to rule 5. As
            mentioned before, Rule 5 actually has two versions, one for finding P(A and B) in the

            <?oxy_insert_end?>when the events are not necessarily independent. We will first present
