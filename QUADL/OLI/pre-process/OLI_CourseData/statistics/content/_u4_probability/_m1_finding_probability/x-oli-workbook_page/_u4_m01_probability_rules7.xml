        <p>As you've seen, the last three rules that we've introduced
            (<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T201046-0500"?>the
            <?oxy_insert_end?>Complement Rule,
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T201050-0500"?>the
            <?oxy_insert_end?>Addition Rule for Disjoint Events,
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T201053-0500"?>and the
            <?oxy_insert_end?>Multiplication Rule for Independent Events) are frequently used in
            solving problems. Before we move on to our next rule,
            <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T201132-0500" content="t"?>here are two
            comments that will help you use these rules in broader
            type<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T201146-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>
            of problems and more effectively.</p>

                <p>As we mentioned before, the Addition Rule can be extended to more than two
                    disjoint events. Likewise, the Multiplication Rule can be extended to more than
                    two independent events. So if A,<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T201454-0500"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>B<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T201459-0500"?>
                    and
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T201458-0500" content=","?>C
                    are three independent events, for example, then P(A and B and C) = P(A) * P(B) *
                    P(C). These extensions are quite
                    straightforward<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T201525-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    as long as you remember that "or" requires us to add, while "and" requires us to
                    multiply.</p>
                <p>An example of a situation where more than two independent events naturally occur
                    is when a random sample of more than two individuals is chosen from a large
                    population.</p>
                <p>Here is an example:</p>
                <example>

                    <p>Three people are chosen at random from a large population. What is the
                        probability that all three have blood type B? We'll use the usual notation
                        of B1, B2 and B3 for the events that
                        <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T201827-0500" content="the first, second and third person"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T201827-0500"?>persons
                        1, 2 and 3<?oxy_insert_end?> have blood type B, respectively. We need to
                        find P(B1 and B2 and B3). Let's solve this one together:</p>

                <p>Here is another example that might be quite surprising.</p>
                <example>

                    <p>A fair coin is tossed 10 times. Which of the following two outcomes is more
                        likely? </p>

                    <p>In fact, they are equally likely.

                    <p>P(HTTHHTHTTH) = P(H) * P(T) * ... * P(H) = 1/2 * 1/2 *... * 1/2 =

                    <p>Here is the idea:</p>
                    <p>My random experiment here is tossing a coin 10 times. You can imagine how
                        huge the sample space
                        is<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T203851-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T203850-0500" content="!"?></p>
                    <p>There are actually
                        1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T203114-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>024
                        possible outcomes to this experiment, all of which are equally likely.
                        Therefore, while it is true that it is more likely to get an outcome that
                        has 5 heads and 5 tails than an outcome that has only heads (since there is
                        only one possible outcome of the latter kind, and many possible outcomes of
                        the former), if I am comparing 2 <em>specific outcomes</em> as I do here,
                        they are equally likely.</p>
