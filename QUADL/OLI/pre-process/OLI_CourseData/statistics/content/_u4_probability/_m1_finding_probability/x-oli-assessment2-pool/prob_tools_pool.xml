            <response match="A" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. The probability of experiencing only nausea is P(N) − P(N and D)
                    = 0.2 − 0.15 = 0.05. You could also build a probability table to find P(N and

            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. You may have correctly determined that we want P(only N) = P(N
                    and "not D"), but you may have tried to calculate this probability multiplying
                    P(N) and P(not D). This does not work because these events are not independent.
                    Instead, you could calculate P(only N) = P(N) − P(N and D) = or build a
                    probability table to find P(N and "not D").</feedback>

            <response match="C" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. 0.20 is the probability of experiencing nausea. P(N) includes
                    the people who experienced both side effects. The probability of experiencing
                    <em style="italic">only</em> nausea is P(N) − P(N and D). You could also build a probability table to

            <response match="D" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. You may have added P(N) = 0.20 and P(N and D) = 0.15, but this
                    is incorrect because P(N) includes the people who experienced both side effects.
                    The probability of experiencing <em style="italic">only</em> nausea is P(only N)
                    = P(N) − P(N and D) = 0.2 − 0.15 = 0.05. You could also build a probability

                    your probability table. But the sample space for this event is only ("not N" and
