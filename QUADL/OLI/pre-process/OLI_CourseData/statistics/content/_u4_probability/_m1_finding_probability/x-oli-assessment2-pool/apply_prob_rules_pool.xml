If the probability is 0, then it would be impossible to select two supporters of candidate X. Clearly, this is not right. Let A = "the first
 person supports X." Let B = "second person supports X." We want P(A and B).
 Since the population is fairly large the events are independent, so we can use
 the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events.</p></feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback><p id="af55f174fd9ea474a8d23b3c6ed8f17db">Correct. Let A = "the first person supports X." Let B = "the second person supports X." We want P(A and B). Because the population is fairly
 large, the events are independent, and we can use the Multiplication Rule for
 Independent Events, which in this case equals (0.45)(0.45) = 0.2025.</p></feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback><p id="af9163f6bb4804571a9facaaacc333473">Incorrect. You may have interpreted the probability of selecting two supporters of candidate X as the complement of selecting two supporters of
 candidate Y, but the complement of two supporters of candidate Y is
 equivalent to "at least one supporter of candidate X." Because the population
 is fairly large, the events are independent, and we can use the Multiplication
 Rule for Independent Events.</p></feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback><p id="af325f61eb64b4d06a2f149e3de942294">Incorrect. Let A = "the first person supports X." Let B = "second person supports X." You may have added probabilities instead of using the
 Multiplication Rule for Independent Events, which applies here because the
 population is fairly large.</p></feedback></response></part></multiple_choice></pool>
