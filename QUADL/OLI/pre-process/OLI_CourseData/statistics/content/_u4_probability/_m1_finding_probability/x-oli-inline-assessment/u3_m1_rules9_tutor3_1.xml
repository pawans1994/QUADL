                    <feedback>Incorrect. The event “admitted to at least one of the two
                        colleges” means admitted to College A or College B or both. You may have
                        interpreted all of these “or” statements as meaning “addition” and
                        calculated P(A) + P(B) + P(A and B), but this is incorrect because P(A and
                        B) is included in P(A), as well as P(B). So P(A and B) is subtracted from
                        P(A) + P(B) as shown in the General Addition Rule.</feedback>

                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Not quite right. P(admitted to at least one college) = P(A or B), but
                        the events are not disjoint. So P(A or B) is not equal to P(A) + P(B). You
                        need to use the General Addition Rule.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. P(admitted to at least one college) = P(A or B). Since the
                        events are not disjoint, we must use the General Addition Rule. P(A or B) =
                        0.10 + 0.75 − 0.05 = 0.80</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="D" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. You may have used the General Addition Rule P(A or B)
                        = P(A) + P(B) − P(A and B) but calculated P(A and B) incorrectly by
                        multiplying P(A) * P(B). This is incorrect because A and B are not independent
                        in this situation. P(A and B) is given as 0.05, which is not equal to
                        P(A) * P(B) = 0.10 * 0.75 = 0.075.</feedback>
