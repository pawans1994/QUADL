    <content>
        <p>A couple decides to have children until they have one boy and one girl, but they will not
            have more than three children. The sample space of possible outcomes is S = {GB, BG,
            BBG, GGB, BBB, GGG}.</p>
        <p>Consider the following events:</p>
        <p>A–the couple has one boy</p>
        <p>C–the couple has three children</p>
        <p>D–all of the children are the same gender</p>

        <p>Determine if the following pairs of events are disjoint.</p>
