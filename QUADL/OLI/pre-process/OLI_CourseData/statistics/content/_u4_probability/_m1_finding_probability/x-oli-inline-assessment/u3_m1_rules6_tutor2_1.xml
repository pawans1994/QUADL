			<!--LO:LO: Apply probability rules in order to find the likelihood of an event.   Sub-objective: rule5        Probability rule 5    -->
			<body><p>Recall the estimate by the Pew Research Center that 62% of U.S. adults favor
					the death penalty for murder. The same report gave a much lower estimate for the
					percentage of U.S. college graduates supporting the death penalty in cases of
					murder. According to census data from 2000, roughly 28% of U.S. adults have a
					college degree. </p>
				<p><em style="bold">What is the probability that a randomly selected U.S. adult has
						a college degree and favors the death penalty?</em></p>
				<p>Let A be the event that a U.S. adult has a college degree. Let B be the event
					that this person supports the death penalty. We want to find P(A and B). </p>
				<p>Which answer is correct, Answer 1 or 2?</p></body>
			<multiple_choice shuffle="false">
				<choice value="A">Answer 1: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.62(0.28) = 0.1736
					We can use the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events because the events
						are independent. Having a college degree does not determine a person’s views
						on the death penalty.</choice>
				<choice value="B">Answer 2: We do not have enough information to answer the
						question. We cannot use the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events
						because these events are dependent. Having a college degree affects the
						likelihood that a person supports the death penalty.</choice>
			</multiple_choice>
			<part>
				<response match="A" score="0">
					<feedback>Not quite right. While it is true that having a college degree does
						not determine a person’s views on the death penalty, having a college degree
						does make it <em style="italic">less likely</em> that a person will support the death penalty. So A
						and B are dependent events. We cannot use the Multiplication Rule for
						Independent Events in this situation.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="B" score="10">
					<feedback>Correct. A and B are dependent events because if A occurs (we have
						selected a person with a college degree), then the probability of B is
						affected (a smaller chance that the person supports the death penalty.) So
						we cannot use the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events in this
						situation.</feedback>
