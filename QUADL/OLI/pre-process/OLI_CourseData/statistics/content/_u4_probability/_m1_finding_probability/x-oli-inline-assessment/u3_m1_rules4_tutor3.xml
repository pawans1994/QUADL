         <p>Try to (wrongly) apply the addition rule for disjoint events to P(D1 or D2), and explain
               why the answer you got proves that the addition rule for disjoint events does not
               work in <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T133953-0500"?>cases in

            <p>If we

                  apply the addition rule for disjoint events in order to find P(D1 or D2) we'll
                  get:</p>
            <p>P(D1 or D2) = P(D1) + P(D2) = .86 + .54 = 1.4</p>
            <p>The answer is wrong for
                  certain<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T134049-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T134047-0500" content="(!)"?>
                  since we got a probability that is greater than 1. This proves the danger of
                  incorrectly applying the addition rule for disjoint events when it is
                  <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T134106-0500"?>not<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T134105-0500" content="NOT"?>
                  appropriate to do so.</p>
