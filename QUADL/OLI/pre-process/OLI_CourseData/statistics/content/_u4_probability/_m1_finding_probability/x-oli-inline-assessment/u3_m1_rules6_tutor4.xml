			<body><p>According to the most updated data gathered by the American Association of
					Suicidology, 80% of suicides in the U.S. are committed by men.</p>
				<p>Two suicide cases are selected at random. What is the probability that both
					suicides were committed by a person of the same gender?</p></body>
			<multiple_choice shuffle="false">
				<choice value="A">0.64</choice>
				<choice value="B">0.68</choice>
				<choice value="C">1.6</choice>
				<choice value="D">Cannot be determined since the outcomes are not
					independent</choice>
				<choice value="E">cannot be determined since the events are not disjoint</choice>
			</multiple_choice>
			<part>
				<response match="A" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. 0.64 is the probability that both suicides were men.
						What other outcome fits the description “same gender”?</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="B" score="10">
					<feedback>Correct. P(both suicides same gender) = P(both males) + P(both
						females) = (0.8)(0.8) + (0.2)(0.2) = 0.68</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="C" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. A probability cannot be greater than 1. What outcomes
						fit the description “both suicides same gender”?</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="D" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. Since both people are selected from a presumably
						large population of suicides, we can assume the outcomes are
						independent.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="E" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. Two events fit the description “both suicides same
						gender”: MM and FF. These are disjoint events, so we can add P(both males) +
						P(both females).</feedback>
