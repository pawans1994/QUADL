			<multiple_choice shuffle="false">
				<choice value="A">Neither alarm rang</choice>

				<choice value="D">Both alarms rang</choice>
			</multiple_choice>
			<part>
				<response match="A" score="10">
					<feedback>Correct. "Not D" means the dining room alarm did not ring. "Not B"
						means the bedroom alarm did not ring. "Not D" and "not B" means these events
						occurred together, so neither alarm rang.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="B" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. If at least one alarm rang, then we want to find P(A
						or B). This is the complement of the event "not D" and "not B." </feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="C" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. There are two events that describe the situation
						where only one alarm rangs: (D and "not B") or ("not D" and B). </feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="D" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. When both alarms ring, the event is (D and
						B).</feedback>
				</response>
				<hint>"Not D" and "not B" means these events occurred together.</hint>
