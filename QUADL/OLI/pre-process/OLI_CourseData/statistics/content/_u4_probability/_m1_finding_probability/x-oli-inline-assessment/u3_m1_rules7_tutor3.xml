I&apos;m sure for some later examples, the wording &quot;chosen simultaneously and at random&quot; isn&apos;t going to be acceptable, because choosing three people simultaneously will involve different math than making three independent choices.

I think that on the main page after this exercise would be a good place to make a statement about how with a certain minimum population size (is there some generally accepted number? If so, please include it) to assume that when taking a random sample of several members of that population, the first choice won&apos;t affect the second choice in a mathematically significant way, and therefore you can treat the events as independent. 

From this point forward, I will operate under the assumption that a note has been inserted, either at the end of page 7 or before that, that describes this special case, and so from her forward, the wording will assume that random samples from large populations are independent.

            <p>To get all three the same, either the first and the second and the third are type O,
               or the first and the second and the third are type A, or the first and the second and
               the third are type B, or the first and the second and the third are type AB. The
               probability is:</p>
