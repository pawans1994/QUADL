        <body>
            <p>A couple decides to have children until they have one boy and one girl, but they will
                not have more than three children. Choose the correct sample space for this random
                experiment. <input_ref input="A"/></p>

                    is not part of the sample space, since the couple would not have the third child
                    after having a girl and a boy.</feedback>

                <feedback>Not quite right. All of these outcomes are possible, but this sample space
                    is missing some outcomes. Note that the couple will not necessarily have 3

                <feedback>Not quite right. All of these outcomes are possible, but this sample space
                    is missing some outcomes. If the first two children are the same gender, the
                    couple will have a 3rd child. What outcomes are possible in this
                    case?</feedback>

                <feedback>Correct. Each outcome has one boy and one girl, except if the couple has
                    three children of the same gender (in which case they stop having children
                    because they originally decided to have no more than 3.)</feedback>
