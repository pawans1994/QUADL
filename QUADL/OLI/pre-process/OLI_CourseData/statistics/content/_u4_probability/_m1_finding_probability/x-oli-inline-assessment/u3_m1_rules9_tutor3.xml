			<body><p>There are two traffic lights on Fred’s route from home to work. Over the years
					Fred has tracked when he has to stop at these lights. He determined that 45% of
					the time he has to stop at the first light; 30% of the time he has to stop at
					the second light, and 20% of the time he has to stop at both lights. </p>
				<p>Let A be the event that Fred has to stop at the first light. Let B be the event
					that Fred has to stop at the second light. What is the probability that Fred has
					to stop at one or more lights on his way to work?</p></body>

				<response match="A" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. You may have used the General Addition Rule P(A or B)
						= P(A) + P(B) − P(A and B) but calculated P(A and B) incorrectly by
						multiplying P(A) * P(B). This is incorrect because A and B are not independent
						in this situation. P(A and B) is given as 0.20, which is not equal to
						P(A) * P(B) = 0.45 * 0.30 = 0.135. </feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="B" score="10">
					<feedback>Correct. P(at least one stop) = P(A or B). Since the events are not
						disjoint, we must use the General Addition Rule. P(A or B) = 0.45 + 0.30 −
						0.20 = 0.55</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="C" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. P(at least one stop) = P(A or B) but the events are
						not disjoint. So P (A or B) is not equal to P(A) + P(B). You need to use the
						General Addition Rule. </feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="D" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. Adding all three probabilities is incorrect since
						P(A) = 0.45 and P(B) = 0.30 both include the situation in which Fred stops
						at both lights. So P(A and B) = 0.20 has to be subtracted as shown in the
						General Addition Rule.</feedback>
				</response>
				<hint>The event “stop at one or more lights” is equivalent to “stop at at least one
					light.” In other words, you need to find the probability that Fred stops at the
					first light or the second light or both, which is P(A or B).</hint>
