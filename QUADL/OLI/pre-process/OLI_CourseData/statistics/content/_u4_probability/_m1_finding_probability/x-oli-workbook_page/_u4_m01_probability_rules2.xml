        <p>Let's move on to rule 3. In probability and in its applications, we are frequently
            interested in finding out the probability that a certain event will<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T112405-0500" content="does"?>

            occur. An important point to understand here is that "event A does not occur" is
                <em>a<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T112435-0500"?>

                event<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T112441-0500" content=" by itself"?></em>

            are not in A. It is for this reason that the event "event A does not occur" is called
            <em style="bold">"the complement event of A,"</em> since it compares event A to the whole
            sample space. Notation: we will write <em>"not A"</em> to denote the event that A does

            occur. Here is a visual representation of how event A and its complement event "not A"

                <p>Such a visual display is called a "Venn diagram."

        <p>Rule 3 deals with the relationship between the probability of an event and the
            probability of its complement event. Given that event A
            and<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T113311-0500" content=" the"?> event
            "not A" together make up the whole sample space S, and since rule 2 tells us that P(S) =
            1, the following rule should be quite intuitive:</p>
        <theorem type="rule">
            <title>Rule 3: The Complement Rule</title>
            <statement>

            <p>Back to the blood type example:</p>

            <p>Here is some additional information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A person with type <em>A</em> can donate blood to a person with type <em>A</em>
                    or <em>AB</em>.</li>
                <li>A person with type <em>B</em> can donate blood to a person with type <em>B</em>
                    or <em>AB</em>.</li>
                <li>A person with type <em>AB</em> can donate blood to a person with type

                In other words, what is the probability that a randomly chosen person does not have
                blood type O? We need to find P(not O). Using the Complement Rule, P(not O)<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T113553-0500"?>

                    manipulation has an important application, and actually captures the strength of
                    the complement rule. In some cases, when finding P(A) directly is very
                    complicated, it might be much easier to find P(not A) and
