                <p>When dealing with probabilities, the word "or" will always be associated with the

        <example>

            <p>Recall the blood type example:</p>

    O: 0.44;
    A: 0.42;
    B: 0.10;
    AB: 0.04;"/>
            <p>Here is some additional information:</p>
            <p>* A person with type <em>A</em> can donate blood to a person with type <em>A</em> or
                    <em>AB.</em>
            </p>
            <p>* A person with type <em>B</em> can donate blood to a person with type <em>B</em> or
                    <em>AB.</em>
            </p>
            <p>* A person with type <em>AB</em> can donate blood to a person with type <em>AB</em>
                only.</p>
            <p>* A person with type <em>O</em> blood can donate to anyone.</p>
            <p>What is the probability that a randomly chosen person is a potential donor for a
                person with blood type A? </p>
            <p>From the information given, we know that being a potential donor for a person with
                blood type A means having
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T125946-0500" content="either "?>blood
                type A or O. We therefore need to find P(A or O). Since
                the<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T130052-0500" content=" two"?>
                events A and O are disjoint, we can use the addition rule for disjoint events to
                get: P(A or O)<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T130103-0500"?>

                It is easy to see why adding the probability actually makes sense. If 42% of the
                population has blood type A and 44% of the population has blood type O, then 42%<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T130126-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>+<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T130127-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>44%<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T130128-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>=<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T130129-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>86% of the population has either blood type A or O, and thus are
                potential donors to a person with blood type A. This reasoning about why the
                addition rule makes sense can be visualized using the pie<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T130155-0500"?>

as A or O, they take up 86% of the pie chart."/>

                <p>So far we have introduced the

                    make you aware of the danger in wrongly using the addition rule for disjoint
                    events in cases where the events are actually not disjoint. Consider the blood
