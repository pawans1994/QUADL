	<content><p>What is the probability that at least one of the next two strangers you meet
		shares your birth month? For this problem assume birth months are equally
		likely, so the probability of being born in a given month is 1/12 (about 0.083).</p>
		<p><em style="bold">Let A = first stranger shares your birth month</em></p>
		<p><em style="bold">Let B = second stranger shares your birth month</em></p>
		<p>Assume that meeting two strangers is like randomly selecting two people from a large population.</p></content>

					<feedback>Incorrect. 1/12 * 1/12 = 1/144 is the probability that both
						strangers share your birth month. The probability that at least one stranger
						shares your birth month is P(A or B). Since the events are not disjoint, we
						must use the General Addition Rule.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="B" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. Adding all three probabilities is incorrect since
						P(A) = 1/12 and P(B) = 1/12 both include the situation in which both
						strangers share your birth month. So P(A and B) = (1/12)(1/12) has to be
						subtracted as shown in the General Addition Rule.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="C" score="10">
					<feedback>Correct. P(at least one stranger shares your birth month) = P(A or
						B). Since the events are not disjoint, we must use the General Addition
						Rule. Since the events are independent, P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B). So P(A or B)
						= 1/12 + 1/12 â€“ (1/12)(1/12) = 0.1597 or about 0.16.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="D" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. P(at least one stranger shares your birth month) =
						P(A or B). We are given P(A) and P(B). Since the events are independent, P(A
						and B) = P(A) * P(B). So we use the General Addition Rule to find P(A or
						B).</feedback>
