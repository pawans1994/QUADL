            the previous module, we introduced probability as a way to quantify the uncertainty that
            arises from
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104355-0400"?>conducting<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104352-0400" content="repeating random"?>
            experiments <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104442-0400"?>using a
            random sample of the population of
            interest<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104504-0400" content="such as selecting an individual and recording his/her blood type"?>.
            <?oxy_comment_end?>We saw that the probability of an event (for example, the event that
            a randomly chosen person
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104043-0400"?>has
            <?oxy_insert_end?>blood type O) can be estimated by the relative frequency with which
            the event occurs in a long series of trials. So we
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104316-0400"?>would
            <?oxy_insert_end?>collect data from lots of individuals to estimate the probability of
            someone having blood type O. </p>
    
    
    <p>In this
            module<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104545-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            weâ€™ll first reintroduce probability, but this time in a more formal way, in a section
            called
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104833-0400" content="&quot;"?><em>Sample
                Spaces and
            Events</em>.<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104836-0400" content="&quot;"?>
            We will then establish the basic methods and principles for finding probabilities of
            events<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104902-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            which will be organized in two sections:
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104909-0400" content="&quot;"?><em>Equally
                Likely
            Outcomes</em><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104906-0400" content="&quot;"?>
            and
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104913-0400" content="&quot;"?><em>Probability
                Rules</em>.<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101106T104915-0400" content="&quot;"?>
