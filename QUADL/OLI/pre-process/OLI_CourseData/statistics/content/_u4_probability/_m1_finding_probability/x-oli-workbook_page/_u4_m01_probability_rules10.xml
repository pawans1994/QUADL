        <p>In our delivery example, there are two categorical variables of interest in the
            background: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>On-time delivery by service A (yes/no)</li>
            <li>On-time delivery by service B (yes/no)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since each of the two has two possible values (yes/no), there are four possible
            combinations altogether, which correspond to the four possible outcomes of using the two
            services.</p>
        <p>While the Venn diagrams were great to visualize the General Addition Rule, in cases like
            these it is much easier to display the information in and work with a two-way table of
            probabilities, much as we examined the relationship between two categorical variables in
            the Exploratory Data Analysis section.</p>
        <p>How do we build a two-way table of probabilities? Let's use our delivery example to
            illustrate this simple
            process:<!--<?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101108T235023-0500" comment="In the walkthrough below I noticed two minor anomalies. I think it is probably not worth re-doing the voiceover of the walkthrough to fix these, but I wanted to point them out, just in case you feel differently.

1. At the beginning, the narrator says &quot;Here, again, is the probability table.&quot; This is the first time students have seen the table, so the &quot;again&quot; is not necessary.

2. the value .15 is usually read &quot;point one five&quot; rather than &quot;point fifteen.&quot;

A I said above, these issues are VERY minor, and if&apos;s going to take much effort, I wouldn&apos;t bother to change this if I were you."?><?oxy_comment_end?>--></p>

                <p>A common mistake is to confuse between: P(A) = P(event A occurs) and P(A and Not
                    B) = P(ONLY event A occurs)[and similarly, between P(B) = P(event B occurs) and
                    P(Not A and B) = P(only event B occurs)]. </p>
                <p>Looking at the probability table is a great way to clear-up this confusion:</p>

Here is the highlighted data in &quot;Row, Column&quot; format:
        A, B:  P(A and B) = 0.75;
        A, not B: P(A and not B) = 0.15;
        A, Total: P(A) = 0.90 = P(A and B) + P(A and not B)"/>

                    the document on time. </p>
                <p>These cases of on-time delivery by service A can be decomposed into two
                    sub-cases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>P(A and B) = 0.75 → 75% of the time the document is delivered on time also
                        by service B (i.e., the document is delivered on time by both services)</li>
                    <li>P(A and Not B) = 0.15 → 15% of the time the document is not delivered on
                        time by service B (i.e., delivered on time only by service A). </li>

                <p>In both the delivery problem and the smoke detector problem, we knew P(A), P(B)
                    and P(A and B). (In the smoke detector problem, we actually needed to work a bit
                    to get P(A and B), but it wasn't too bad.) Visually, we had the probability for
                    the three shaded cells below, which was enough information to complete the
                    table.</p>

        Cells {A,B}, {A, Total}, and {Total, B} have been shaded."/>
                <p>This, however, is not the only combination of three cells that would provide
                    sufficient information to complete the table. Essentially, as long as we are
                    given (or can calculate) one cell in each of the margins (the total row and
                    column), and one of the four cells in the body of the table, we'll be able to
                    complete the entire table. Visually, we need:</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image032.gif"
                    alt="The same table. We need
information about one of the cells in the body of the table. These cells are {A,B}, {A, not B},
{not A, B}, and {not A, not B}. In addition, we need information from one of the cells on the right
margin. These cells are {A, Total} and {not A, Total}. The last group of cells we need information from
is the bottom margin. These cells are {Total, B} and {Total, not B}. With one cell from each of these

                <p>Researchers studied thousands of court cases. For each case, they recorded the

            <body>
                <p>When we used two-way tables in the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) section, it
                    was to record values of two categorical variables for a concrete <em>sample</em>
                    of individuals. In contrast, the information in a probability two-way table is
                    for an entire <em>population</em>, and the values are rather abstract. If we had
                    treated something like the delivery example in the EDA section, we would have
                    recorded the actual numbers of on-time (and not-on-time) deliveries for samples
                    of documents mailed with service A or B. In this section, the long-term
                    probabilities are presented as being known. Presumably, those probabilities were
                    based on relative frequencies recorded over many repetitions. </p>
