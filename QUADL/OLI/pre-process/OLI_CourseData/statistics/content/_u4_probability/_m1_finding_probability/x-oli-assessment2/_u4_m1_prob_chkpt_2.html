				<feedback> Not quite right. If the probability is 0, then it would be impossible to
					select two males. Clearly, this is not right. Let A = “the first person is a
					male”. Let B = “second person is a male”. We want P(A and B).The events are
					independent since the population is fairly large, so the answer is (0.4)(0.4) =
					0.16. The correct answer is (B).</feedback>

			<response match="B" score="10">
				<feedback>Correct. Let A = “the first person is a male”. Let B = “second person is
					a male”. We want P(A and B). Because the population is fairly large, the events
					are independent, and we can use the Multiplication Rule for Independent
					Events.</feedback>

				<feedback>Not quite right. Let A = “the first person is a male”. Let B = “second
					person is a male”. We want P(A and B). You may have added probabilities instead
					of using the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events. The events are
					independent because the population is fairly large, so the answer is (0.4)(0.4)
					= 0.16. The correct answer is (B).</feedback>
			</response>
			<response match="D" score="0">
				<feedback>Not quite right. You may have interpreted the probability of selecting two
					males as the complement of selecting two females, but the complement of two
					females is equivalent to “at least one male.” To find the probability of
					selecting two males, use the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events. The
					events are independent because the population is fairly large, so the answer is
					(0.4)(0.4) = 0.16. The correct answer is (B).</feedback>

				<feedback>Correct. P(both of the same gender) = P(2 males or 2 females) =
					[disjoint events] P(2 males) + P(2 females) = [random selection → independent]
					(.40 * .40) + (.60 * .60) = .16 + .36 = .52. </feedback>

				<feedback>Incorrect. It seems that you have calculated the

					probability of both selected people being of the same gender. Consider the

			<response match="D" score="0">
				<feedback>Incorrect. It seems that you have calculated the
