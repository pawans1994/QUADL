			<body>According to a study published by the National Institute of Health, during
				intercourse condom breakage rates fall between 0.4% and 2.3%. Suppose that the
				breakage rate of Brand X is 2%. A Brand X Pleasure Pack contains 12 condoms. What is
				the probability that at least one of the condoms in the pack will break during
				intercourse?</body>
			<multiple_choice shuffle="false">
				<choice value="A"><p>0.02</p></choice>
				<choice value="B"><p>0.016</p></choice>

			<part>
				<response match="A" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. 0.02 is the probability that a condom will break. But
						you need to consider all 12 condoms to find the probability that at least
						one will break out of the 12. </feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="B" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. You may have calculated the probability that exactly
						one condom in the pack breaks, which is (0.02)(0.98) ^ 11. You need to find
						the probability that AT LEAST one condom in the pack breaks. </feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="C" score="10">
					<feedback>Correct. P(at least one breaks) = 1 âˆ’ P(none break) = 1 - (0.98) ^ 12 =
						0.215</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="D" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. You may have calculated (0.98) ^ 12, which is the
						probability that none of the condoms break. You need to use the complement
						rule to find the probability that at least one breaks. </feedback>
