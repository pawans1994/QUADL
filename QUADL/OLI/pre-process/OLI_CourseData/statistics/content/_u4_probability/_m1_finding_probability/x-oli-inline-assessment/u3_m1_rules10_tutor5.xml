			<body>What is the probability that only the dining room alarm rings? Pick the correct
				symbolic representation.</body>
			<multiple_choice shuffle="false">
				<choice value="A">P(D) </choice>

				<choice value="C">P(D and "not B")</choice>
				<choice value="D">None of these</choice>
			</multiple_choice>
			<part>
				<response match="A" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. P(only D) is different from P(D) because P(D)
						includes the situation in which both alarms ring (dining room alarm rings
						and bedroom alarm rings). We want the probability that only the dining room
						alarm rings without the bedroom alarm.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="B" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. P(not B) includes situations in which the dining room
						alarm rings and situations in which the dining room alarm does not ring.
					</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="C" score="10">
					<feedback>Correct. If only the dining room alarm rings, then D and "not B" both
						occur.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="D" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. We want the probability that only the dining room
						alarm rings. So the dining room alarm rings but the bedroom alarm does
						not.</feedback>
				</response>
				<hint>There is a difference between "the dining room alarm rings" and "only the
					dining room alarm rings."</hint>
				<hint>If only the dining room alarm rings, then the dining room alarm rings and the
					bedroom alarm does not ring. </hint>
