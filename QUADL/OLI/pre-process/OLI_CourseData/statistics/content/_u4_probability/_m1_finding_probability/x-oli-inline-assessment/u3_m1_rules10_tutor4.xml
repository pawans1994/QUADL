			<body><p>Recall the example concerning the delivery of an important document. To
					maximize the chances of on-time delivery, two copies of the document are sent
					using two services, service A and service B. It is known that the probabilities
					of on-time delivery are:</p>
				<p>0.90 for service A: P(A) = 0.90</p>
				<p>0.80 for service B: P(B) = 0.80</p>
				<p>0.75 for both services being on time: P(A and B) = 0.75</p>
				<p>What is the probability that only service B delivers the document on
				time?</p></body>
			<multiple_choice shuffle="false">
				<choice value="A">P(B) = 0.80</choice>
				<choice value="B">P(not A) = 0.10</choice>
				<choice value="C">P("not A" and B) = 0.05</choice>
				<choice value="D">none of these</choice>
			</multiple_choice>
			<part>
				<response match="A" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. P(B) is different from P(only B) because P(B)
						includes the situation in which both services deliver the document on time.
						(A delivers it on time and B delivers it on time). </feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="B" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. P(not A) includes situations in which service B
						delivers the document on time and situations in which service B does not
						deliver the document on time. </feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="C" score="10">
					<feedback>Correct. If only service B delivers on time, then B and "not A" both
						occur.</feedback>
				</response>
				<response match="D" score="0">
					<feedback>Incorrect. We want the probability that only service B delivers
						on time which means service A does not deliver on time.</feedback>
