        <p>So far in our study of
            probability<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010401-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            you have <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010404-0500"?>been
            <?oxy_insert_end?>introduced to the sometimes counterintuitive nature of probability and
            the fundamentals that underlie

            and relative frequency. We also gave you some tools to help you find
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T010547-0500"?>the

            the probability rules. You probably noticed that the probability section

            significantly different from the two previous

            the results tend to be more of the "right or wrong" nature. In the Exploratory Data
            Analysis section, for the most
            part<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T011018-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            the computer took care of the technical aspect of things, and our tasks were to tell it
            to do the right thing and then interpret the results. In
            probability<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T011020-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            we do the work from beginning to end, from choosing the right tool (rule) to use,
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T011054-0500"?>to
            <?oxy_insert_end?>using it correctly,

            <?oxy_insert_end?>interpreting the results. Finally, we have one piece of unfinished
            business left from this module. We have only discussed the version of the
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T011210-0500"?>M<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T011209-0500" content="m"?>ultiplication

            is restricted to independent events and we still need to lift this restriction and
            introduce the

                <p>Before you do the checkpoint activity, please evaluate your understanding of the
                    learning objectives for the Finding Probability of Events module and use the
                    first <em>My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about
                    the material that you would like the instructor to address. Your questions can
                    be for clarification of the material or further insight. Your self-evaluation
                    and questions may also shape the discussions in class.</p>
                <p>Your response will not be graded, but will be available for your instructor to
                    read.
