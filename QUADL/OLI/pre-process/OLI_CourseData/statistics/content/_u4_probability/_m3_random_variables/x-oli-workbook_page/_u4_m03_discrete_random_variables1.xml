<section>
<title>Discrete Random Variables</title>
<body>
<p>As the introduction suggests, the first part of this module will be devoted to discrete random variables: variables whose possible values are a list of distinct values.  In order to decide on some notation, let's look at the coin toss example again:</p>
<p>A fair coin is tossed twice.  Let the random variable X be the number of tails we get in this random experiment.  In this case, the possible values that X can assume are 0 (if we get HH), 1 (if get HT or TH) , and 2 (if we get TT).</p>

<title>Notation</title>
<body>
<p>If we want to find the probability of the event "getting 1 tail," we'll write: <em>P(X = 1)</em>
</p>
<p>If we want to find the probability of the event "getting 0 tails," we'll write: <em>P(X = 0)</em>
</p>
<p>In general, we'll write: <em>P(X = x)</em> to denote the probability that the discrete random variable X gets the value x.</p>
<p>Note that for the random variables we'll use a capital letter, and for the value we'll use a

<p>The way this section on discrete random variables is organized is very similar to the way we
                    organized our discussion about one quantitative variable in the
