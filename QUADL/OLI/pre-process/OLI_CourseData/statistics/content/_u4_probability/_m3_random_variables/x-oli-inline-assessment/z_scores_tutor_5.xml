            <body><p>Cindy works for a competing accounting firm called “Ace Pro Accountants.” The
                    hourly salary rate for accountants follow a normal distribution, with a mean of
                    $24 and a standard deviation of $3. Cindy earns $18 an hour.</p><p> Whose salary
                    is lower relative to his/her company’s mean salary: Tom or Cindy’s?</p></body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="false" select="single">
                <choice value="A"><p>Tom</p></choice>
                <choice value="B"><p>Cindy</p></choice>
                <choice value="C"><p>They are both equally low.</p></choice>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. While it is true that Tom’'s hourly salary
                        ($22.50) is higher than Cindy's ($18), it makes more sense to compare their
                        z-scores. In other words, it would make more sense to compare their hourly
                        salaries relative to other accountants in their respective companies. Try
                        again.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct! Indeed, Cindy's z-score is -2, while Tom’s z-score is
                        (22.50-27) / 4 = -1.125. Cindy’s hourly salary is lower, since she scored 2 standard
                        deviations below the mean, while Tom scored only 1.125 standard deviations
                        below the mean.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. In order to decide which score is more
                        impressive, compare the z-scores of both Tom's and Cindy’s hourly salaries.
                        Bear in mind that each of the hourly salary rates come from a different
                        normal distribution.</feedback>
                </response>
                <hint>Use z-scores to compare the relative position of the salaries.</hint>
