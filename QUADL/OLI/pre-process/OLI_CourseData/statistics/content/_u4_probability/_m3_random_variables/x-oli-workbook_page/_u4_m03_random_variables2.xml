                            though they "look like" discrete variables,

        <p>Often we can have a subject matter for which we can collect data that could involve a
            discrete or a continuous random
            variable<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T091050-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            depending on the information we wish to know.</p>
        <example><title>Soft Drinks</title>
            <p>Suppose we want to know <em>how many
                    days<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T091101-0500"?> per
                    <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T091100-0500" content="/"?>week
                    you drink a soft drink</em>. The sample space would be S = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
                6, 7 }. There are a finite number of values for this variable. This would be a
                discrete random variable.</p>
            <p>Instead, suppose we want to know <em>how many ounces of soft drinks you consume per week</em>.  Even if we round to the nearest ounce, the answer is a measurement.  Thus, this would be a continuous random variable.</p>

            <p>Suppose we are interested in the weights of all males.  We take a random sample and get the mean for that sample, namely
