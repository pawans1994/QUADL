      <body>
         <p>The number of computer monitors manufactured per day by CompScreens Inc. is a random
            variable X, with a mean &#956;<sub>x</sub> = 120 and a variance of
               &#963;<sup>2</sup><sub>x</sub> = 36. The cost of manufacturing the monitors is $500
            base cost plus $15 per monitor. </p>
         <p>What is the mean total cost per day for CompScreens Inc. to manufacture computer
            monitors? </p>

            <feedback>Incorrect. You need to consider the mean number of computers manufactured per
                  day, &#956;<sub>x</sub> = 120 when calculating the cost.</feedback>
         </response>
         <response match="Res2" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that &#956;<sub>(a+bX)</sub> = a + b &#956;<sub>x</sub>. It
               seems you used the variance &#963;<sup>2</sup><sub>x</sub> = 36 instead of the mean
                  &#956;<sub>x</sub> = 120.</feedback>

            <feedback>Incorrect. Remember that &#956;<sub>(a+bX)</sub> = a + b &#956;<sub>x</sub>.
               The transformation you used was 15X. However, you forgot about the constant cost of
               $500 to manufacture monitors. </feedback>

            <feedback>Correct. Let T be the total cost of manufacturing monitors for a day. T is
               composed of two parts: the fixed cost of $500 (regardless of the number of monitors)
               and $15 for every monitor made. The total cost can be written as T = 500 + 15X. To
               find the mean of T you use the rule of means: &#956;<sub>(a+bX)</sub> = a +
                  b &#956;<sub>x</sub> = 500 + 15(120) = 2300.</feedback>

      <body>
         <p>A national park has 2 entrance gates, one at the north end and a second gate at the
            south end of the park. Let X be the number of cars entering the North gate per hour and
            let Y be the number of cars entering the South gate per hour. Assume that X is random
            variable with mean &#956;<sub>x</sub> = 23 and standard deviation &#963;<sub>x</sub> =
            3. Assume Y is a random variable with mean &#956;<sub>y</sub> = 18 and standard
            deviation &#963;<sub>y</sub> = 4. Assume that the two gates operate independently. </p>
         <p>What is the mean of Z, the total number of cars entering the park each hour? </p>
