			<p> These  two questions refer to the following information: </p>
			<p> Color-blindness is any abnormality of the color vision system that causes a person to see
				colors differently than most people, or to have difficulty distinguishing among
				certain colors (www.visionrx.com). </p>
			<p> Color-blindness is gender-based, with the majority of sufferers being males. </p>
			<p> Roughly 8% of white males have some form of colorblindness, while the incidence
				among white females is only 1%. </p>
			<p> A random sample of 20 white males and 40 white females was chosen. </p>
			<p> Let <em style="bold">X</em> be the number of males (out of the 20) who are color-blind. </p>
			<p> Let <em style="bold">Y</em> be the number of females (out of the 40) who are color-blind. </p>
			<p> Let <em style="bold">Z</em> be the total number of color-blind individuals in the sample
				(males and females together). </p>
