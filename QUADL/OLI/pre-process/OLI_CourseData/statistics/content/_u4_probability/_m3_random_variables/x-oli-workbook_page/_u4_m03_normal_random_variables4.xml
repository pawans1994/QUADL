            <title>Finding Probabilities with the Normal Table</title>
            <body>
                <p>Now that you have learned to assess the relative value of any normal value by
                    standardizing, the next step is to evaluate probabilities. In other contexts, as
                    mentioned before, we will first take the conventional approach of referring to a
                        <em>normal table</em>, which tells the probability of a normal variable
                    taking a value <em>less than</em> any standardized score z. </p>
                <p>Click <activity_link idref="normal_table" target="new">here</activity_link> to access the normal table.</p>
                <p>Since normal curves are symmetric about their mean, it follows that the curve of
                    z scores must be symmetric about 0. Since the total area under any normal curve
                    is 1, it follows that the areas on either side of z = 0 are both .5. Also,
                    according to the Standard Deviation Rule, most of the area under the
                    standardized curve falls between z = -3 and z = +3.</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image133.gif" alt="A normal probability
distribution curve. The horizontal axis represents z-scores. The mean's z-score has been marked
as 0, and -3 and 3 have been marked. The area to the right of the mean is .5, and the area to the
left of the mean is .5 . Since the area between -3 and 0 is almost all of the area under the bell
curve to the left of the mean, that area is approximately .5 . The same goes for the area between
0 and 3."/>
                <p>The normal table outlines the precise behavior of the standard normal random
                    variable Z, the number of standard deviations a normal value x is below or above
                    its mean. The normal table provides probabilities that a standardized normal
                    random variable Z would take a value less than or equal to a particular value
                    z*.</p>
                <p>These particular values are listed in the form *.* in rows along the left margins
                    of the table, specifying the ones and tenths. The columns fine-tune these values
                    to hundredths, allowing us to look up the probability of being below any
                    standardized value z of the form *.**. Here is part of the table.</p>
