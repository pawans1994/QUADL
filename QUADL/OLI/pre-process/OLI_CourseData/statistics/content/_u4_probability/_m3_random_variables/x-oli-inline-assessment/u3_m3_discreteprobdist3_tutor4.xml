                <feedback>Incorrect. This is not a legitimate probability distribution
                        of X. For example, using this formula, we'll get: P(X = 2) = 2, which is not
                        a number between 0 and 1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T104900-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Using this formula, we'll get the following
                    probability distribution: P(X = 1) = 1/4, P(X = 2) = 1/4, P(X = 3) = 1/4, P(X = 4) = 1/4. Even though
                    this is a legitimate probability distribution, this is not the one that is
                    represented by the histogram and table above. The values are right, but the
                    probabilities are not. Please try again.</feedback>
