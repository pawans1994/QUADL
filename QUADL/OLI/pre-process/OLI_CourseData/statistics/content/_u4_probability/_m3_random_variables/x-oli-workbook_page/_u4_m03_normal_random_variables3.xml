<p>Let's go back to our example of foot length:</p>
<p>How likely or unlikely is it for a male's foot length to be more than 13 inches? </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image129.gif" alt="The probability distribution curve for foot
lengths. It takes the shape of a normal bell curve. The boundaries for the first, second, and third standard
deviations have been marked, and we see that no line falls on X=13 . We need the area under the bell curve to
the right of X=13 ."/>
<p>Since 13 inches doesn't happen to be exactly 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations away from the mean, we would only be able to give a very rough estimate of the probability at this point. 
    Clearly, the Standard Deviation Rule only describes the tip of the iceberg, and while it serves well as an introduction to the normal curve, 
    and gives us a good sense of what would be considered likely and unlikely values, it is very limited in the probability questions it can help us answer.</p>
<p>Here is another familiar normal distribution:</p>
    <image src="../webcontent/image_normal_sat1.jpg" style="block" alt="A normal bell curve representing the
probability distribution curve for the scores on the math portion of the SAT. The horizontal axis is labeled
&quot;X - SAT scores.&quot; &mu; = 500, and &sigma; = 100 . We want to know the probability that a student
scores 633 or higher. This is the area under the bell curve to the right of X=633 . Note that 633 is not covered
by the Standard Deviation Rule."></image>
      <p>Suppose we are interested in knowing the probability that a randomly selected student will
            score 633 or more on
            <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T103117-0500" comment="seems like this must be just one section of the test. I chose Math. OK?"?>the
            math portion of <?oxy_comment_end?>his or her SAT (this is represented by the red area).
            Again, 633 does not fall exactly 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations above the mean. Notice,
            however, that an SAT score of 633 and a foot length of 13 are both about 1/3 of the way
            between 1 and 2 standard deviations. As you continue to read this page, you'll realize
            that this positioning relative to the mean is the key to finding probabilities. </p>

<title>Finding Probabilities for a Normal Random Variable</title>
<body>
<p>As we saw, the Standard Deviation Rule is very limited in helping us answer probability questions, and basically limited to questions involving 
    values that fall exactly 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations away from the mean.  How do we answer probability questions in general?  The key is the position 
    of the value relative to the mean, measured in standard deviations.</p>
    
   <p> We can approach the answering of probability questions two possible ways: a table and
                    technology. In the next sections, you will learn how to use the "standard normal
                    table," and then how the same calculations can be done with technology.</p>
<!-- <p>While using the table is essentially unnecessary with the advent of statistical software, by introducing the table, 
    other important concepts will come up.</p> -->

<title>Standardizing Values</title>
    <body>
<p>The first step to assessing a probability associated with a normal value is to determine the <em>relative</em> value with respect to all 
    the other values taken by that normal variable. 
    This is accomplished by determining how many standard deviations below or above the mean that value is. </p></body></section>

    <example><title>Foot Length</title>

<p>How many standard deviations below or above the mean male foot length is 13 inches? Since the
                mean is 11 inches, 13 inches is 2 inches above the mean. Since a standard deviation
                is 1.5 inches, this would be 2 / 1.5 = 1.33 standard deviations above the mean.
                Combining these two steps, we could write:</p>
<p>(13 in. - 11 in.) / (1.5 inches per standard deviation) = (13 - 11) / 1.5 standard deviations = +1.33 standard deviations.</p>
    </example>
    
<p>In the language of statistics, we have just found the <em>z-score </em>for a male foot length of 13 inches to be z = +1.33. Or, 
    to put it another way, we have <em>standardized</em> the value of 13. In general, the standardized value z tells how many standard deviations 
    below or above the mean the original value is, and is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>
<em>z-score = (value - mean)/standard deviation</em>
</p>
<p>The convention is to denote a value of our normal random variable X with the letter "x." Since
            the mean is written <m:math overflow="scroll">
                <m:mi>μ</m:mi>
            </m:math> and the standard deviation <m:math overflow="scroll">
                <m:mi>σ</m:mi>
            </m:math>, we may write the standardized value as <m:math display="block">
                <m:mrow>
                    <m:mi>z</m:mi>
                    <m:mo>=</m:mo>
                    <m:mfrac>
                        <m:mrow>
                            <m:mi>x</m:mi>
                            <m:mo>&minus;</m:mo>
                            <m:mi>&mu;</m:mi>
                        </m:mrow>
                        <m:mi>&sigma;</m:mi>
                    </m:mfrac>
                </m:mrow>
            </m:math><!--  <image style="block"
                src="../webcontent/image130.gif"/>--></p>
<p>Notice that since <m:math overflow="scroll">
                <m:mi>σ</m:mi>
            </m:math> is always positive, for values of x above the mean (<m:math overflow="scroll">
                <m:mi>μ</m:mi>
            </m:math>), z will be positive; for values of x below <m:math overflow="scroll">
                <m:mi>μ</m:mi>
            </m:math>, z will be negative.</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image131.gif" alt="The probability distribution curve for

<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image132.gif" alt="The same probability distribution curve
as the above image, except that the horizontal axis now represents &quot;standardized foot length

is 0. The location of 13 is now labeled 13's z-score, which is 1.33 ."/>
<example><title>Standardizing Foot Measurements</title>

<p>Let's go back to our foot length example, and answer some more questions.</p>
<p><em>(a)</em> What is the standardized value for a male foot length of 8.5 inches? How does this
                foot length relate to the mean?</p>
<p>z = (8.5 - 11) / 1.5 = -1.67. This foot length is 1.67 standard deviations <em>below</em> the mean.</p>
<p><em>(b)</em> A man's standardized foot length is +2.5. What is his actual foot length in inches? If z = +2.5, then his foot length is 2.5 standard deviations above the mean. 
    Since the mean is 11, and each standard deviation is 1.5, we get that the man's foot length is: 11 + 2.5(1.5) = 14.75 inches.</p>
<p>z-scores also allow us to compare values of different normal random variables. Here is an example:</p>
<p><em>(c)</em> In general, women's foot length is shorter than men's. Assume that women's foot
                length follows a normal distribution with a mean of 9.5 inches and standard
                deviation of 1.2. Ross' foot length is 13.25 inches, and Candace's foot length is
                only 11.6 inches. Which of the two has a longer foot relative to his or her gender
                group?</p>
<p> To answer this question, let's find the z-score of each of these two normal values, bearing in
                mind that each of the values comes from a different normal distribution.</p>
<p> Ross: z-score = (13.25 - 11) / 1.5 = 1.5 (Ross' foot length is 1.5 standard deviations above the
                mean foot length for men).</p>
<p> Candace: z-score = (11.6 - 9.5) / 1.2 = 1.75 (Candace's foot length is 1.75 standard deviations
                above the mean foot length for women).</p>
<p> Note that even though Ross' foot is longer than Candace's, Candace's foot is longer relative to their respective genders.</p>
