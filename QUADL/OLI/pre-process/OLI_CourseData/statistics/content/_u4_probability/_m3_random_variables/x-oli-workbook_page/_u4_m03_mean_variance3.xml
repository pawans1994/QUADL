        <p>Here is another example:</p>

            <p>Suppose you work for an insurance company, and you sell a $100,000 whole-life
                insurance policy at an annual premium of
                $1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T144249-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>200.

                beneficiaries will get $100,000). Actuarial tables show that the probability of
                death during the next year for a person of your customer's age, sex, health, etc. is
                .005. Let the random variable X be the company's gain from such a policy.</p>
            <p>What is the expected or mean gain (amount of money made by the company) for a policy of this type?</p>
            <p>In other words, we need to find <m:math overflow="scroll">

            <p>Since this is a whole-life

                there are two possibilities here; either the customer dies

                <?oxy_insert_end?>(which you are given will happen with probability .005), or the

                the company gets the

                premium. If the customer lives, the company just
                gain<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T144511-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T144510-0500" content="ed"?>

                but if the customer dies, the company needs to pay $100,000 to the customer's
                beneficiaries. Therefore, here is the probability distribution of X:</p>

            <p>Suppose that five years have passed and your actuarial tables indicate that the
                probability of death during the next year for a person of your customer's current
                age has gone up to .0075. Obviously, this change in probability should be reflected
                in the annual premium (since it is slightly more risky for the insurance company to
                insure the customer). </p>
