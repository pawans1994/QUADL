         <p>Ten minutes after the salesperson has started working, he made a sale. What is the probability that this is the only sale that the salesperson will make within the first hour?</p>
         <p>This is a bit tricky.<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T114950-0500"?>

               <?oxy_insert_end?>Let's rephrase the question in a way that will make it easier to
               translate to the language of probability. We are given that one sale has been made 10
               minutes into the hour. This means that the number of sales that will be made within
               the hour, X, is at least one. In other words, we are given that X is greater than or
               equal to 1. Given that information, we are asked to
               find<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T115048-0500" content=" what is"?>
               the probability that this will be the only sale, i.e., that X<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T115056-0500"?>

               <?oxy_insert_end?>1. Putting this

            question asks you to find: P(X=1 | X &#8805; 1). </p>

            <p>(Note that we are treating "X = 1" as event B and "X &#8805; 1" as event A.) Our
                  answer indicates that there is a 30% chance that the sale that the salesperson has
                  made is the only one
