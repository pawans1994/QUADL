        <p>Previous students have said that the next section is challenging. Remember that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em style="bold">The brain is like a muscle:</em> you learn the most when you
                challenge it.</li>
            <li>Even if you don’t get the right answer, the process of trying is what is valuable.
                Learning is about the process of reasoning through confusion to understand something
                new.</li>
            <li>Explain the ideas back to yourself as if you had to teach them to someone else.
                Doing this will clarify your thinking. </li>

            exhibit these properties: symmetry indicates that the variable is just as likely to take
            a value a certain distance below its mean as it is to take a value that same distance
            above its mean; the bell-shape indicates that values closer to the mean are more likely,
            and it becomes increasingly unlikely to take values far from the mean in either
            direction. The particular shape exhibited by these variables has been studied since the
            early part of the nineteenth century, when they were first called

            <title>Observations of Normal Distributions</title>
            <body>

                <p>There are many normal distributions. Even though all of them have the bell-shape,
                    they vary in their center and spread.</p>
                <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image_normal1a.gif" width="505" height="331"
                    alt="Three normal
normal distribution curves which vary in height and mean."/>
                <p>More specifically, the center of the distribution is determined by its
                        <em>mean</em> (<m:math overflow="scroll">
                        <m:mi>μ</m:mi>
                    </m:math>) and the spread is determined by its standard deviation ( <m:math
                        overflow="scroll">
                        <m:mi>σ</m:mi>
                    </m:math>).</p>
                <p>Some observations we can make as we look at this graph are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The black and the red normal curves have means or centers at <m:math
                                overflow="scroll">
                                <m:mi>μ</m:mi>
                            </m:math> = 10. However, the red curve is more spread out and thus has a
                            larger standard deviation. </p>
                        <p>As you look at these two normal curves, notice that
                            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T092548-0500"?>as
                            <?oxy_insert_end?>the red graph is squished down, the spread gets
                            larger, thus allowing the area under the curve to remain the
                        same.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The black and the green normal curves have the same standard deviation or
                            spread (the range of the black
                            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T092627-0500"?>curve
                            <?oxy_insert_end?>is

                            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T092619-0500"?>and
                            <?oxy_insert_end?>the green
                            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T092709-0500"?>curve's
                            range is
                            <?oxy_insert_end?>10.5<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T092612-0500" content=" "?>-<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T092611-0500" content=" "?>17.5).</p></li>
                </ul>
            </body>
        </section>

        <p>Even more important than the fact that many variables themselves follow the normal curve
            is the role played by the normal curve in sampling
            theory<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T092727-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            as we'll see in the next module of probability. Understanding the normal distribution is
            an important step in the direction of our overall goal, which is to relate sample means
            or proportions to population means or proportions. The goal of this section is to better
            understand normal random variables and their distributions.</p>
