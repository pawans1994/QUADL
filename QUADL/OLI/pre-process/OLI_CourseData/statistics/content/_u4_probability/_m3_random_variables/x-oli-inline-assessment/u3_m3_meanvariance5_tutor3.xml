            <feedback>Incorrect.  This distribution has the smallest standard deviation. It has the highest relative frequency near the mean, which 
            makes the standard deviation small.</feedback>

      <hint>The standard deviation is a measure of spread.  Which distribution has lower relative frequencies near the mean and higher 
      relative frequencies further from the mean?</hint>
