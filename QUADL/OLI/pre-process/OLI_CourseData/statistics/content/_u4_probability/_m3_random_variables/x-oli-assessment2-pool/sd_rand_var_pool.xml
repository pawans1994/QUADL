                    mean much more often than values closer to the mean. There is another random
                    variable other than X that has more values further from the mean.</feedback>

                    are close to the mean so this random variable would have the <em style="italic">smallest</em> standard deviation.</feedback>

                <feedback>Correct. All three random variables take the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and it
                    is pretty easy to see (by symmetry) that the mean of all three random variables
                    is 3. The random variables are different, though, with respect to how likely
                    they are to have values that are "far" from the mean. We see that out of the
                    three random variables, random variable Z is the most likely to have values 1
                    and 5 (which are the furthest from the mean), and therefore Z has the largest
                    standard deviation. </feedback>

            <response match="D" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Although the random variables take on the same values, they do
                    not have equal standard deviations. For example, random variable X will have a
                    larger standard deviation than random variable Y because it takes on values 2
                    and 4 more often.</feedback>
