					<feedback> Incorrect. It seems that you have found the probability that in a

			</response>
			<response match="C" score="10">
				<feedback> Correct. All three random variables take the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and it is pretty
						easy to see (by symmetry) that the mean of all three random variables is 3.
						The random variables are different, though, with respect to how likely they
						are to have values that are &quot;far&quot; from the mean. We see that out of the
						three random variables, random variable Z is the most likely to have values
						1 and 5 (which are the furthest from the mean), and therefore Z has the
						largest standard deviation. </feedback>
			</response>
			<response match="D" score="0">
				<feedback>Incorrect. Although the random variables take on the same values, they
						do not have equal standard deviations. For example, random variable X will
						have a larger standard deviation than random variable Y because it takes on
						values 2 and 4 more often. Consider the remaining options. (C) is the right
						answer. </feedback>
			</response>
			<response match="E" score="0">
				<feedback>Incorrect. Remember that the standard deviation of a random variable is
						a measure of how far from the mean  common values of the random variable are
						located. Since the three random variables do not take on values with the
						same probability, you should be able to get a sense of which random variable
						has the highest standard deviation by looking at the histograms. Consider
						the remaining options. (C) is the right answer. </feedback>
