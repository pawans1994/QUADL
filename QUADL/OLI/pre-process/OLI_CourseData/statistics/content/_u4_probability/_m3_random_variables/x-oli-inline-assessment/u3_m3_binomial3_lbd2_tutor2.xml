    <question id="q1">
       <body><p>Using the table of probabilities provided and our conditions that we want P(X â‰¥ 1) to be high, while keeping P(X > 2) low, decide how many 
       embryos you'd implant and why.</p></body> 
        <short_answer id="A"/>
        <part>
            <response input="A" match="*" score="1"></response>
            <explanation><p>Even though the probability of having one child keeps increasing, so does the probability of
                    having more than two children. We think the optimum number is five embryos. You
                    have almost a 70% chance of a baby, while keeping the probability of triplets,
                    quadruplets, etc. to well under 10%.</p></explanation>
        </part>
        <hint>It is clear that the more embryos, the higher percentage of a baby.  Think about the risk you are willing to accept of having triplets, 
        quadruplets, etc.</hint>
