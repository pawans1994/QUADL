                  Indeed, Dan's z-score indicates that his score is 2.4 standard deviations below
                  the mean, which is much below average. In particular, from the standard deviation
                  rule, we know that, since Dan's score is less than 2 standard deviations below the
                  mean, his score is in the lowest 2.5% of scores.</feedback>
