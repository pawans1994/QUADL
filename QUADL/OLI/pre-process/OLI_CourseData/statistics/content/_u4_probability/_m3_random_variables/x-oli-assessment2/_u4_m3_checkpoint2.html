				<feedback> Correct. Let T be the total amount of money that is collected from a car that
					crosses the bridge. T is composed of two parts: the fixed toll of 3 dollars
					(regardless of the number of passengers) and $ .50 for every passenger, thus T =
					3 + 0.50 * X. To find the mean and variance of T you need to use the rules of
