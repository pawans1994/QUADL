<title>Continuous Random Variables</title>

</head>
<body>
<p>In the previous
            section<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223435-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            we discussed discrete random variables: random variables whose possible values are a
            list of distinct numbers. We talked about their probability distributions, means, and
            standard deviations. We are now moving on to discuss continuous random variables: random
            variables which can take any value
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223456-0500"?>i<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223456-0500" content="o"?>n
            an interval, so that
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223508-0500"?>all of
            <?oxy_insert_end?>their
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223512-0500"?>possible
            <?oxy_insert_end?>values cannot be listed (such as height, weight, temperature, time,
            etc.) </p>
<p>As it turns out, most of the methods for dealing with continuous random variables require a
            higher mathematical level than we needed to deal with discrete random variables. For the
            most part, <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223539-0500"?>the
            <?oxy_insert_end?>calculation of probabilities associated with a continuous random
            variable, and its mean and standard deviation, requires knowledge of
            calculus<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223548-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            and is beyond the scope of this course. What we will do in this part is discuss the idea
            behind the probability distribution of a continuous random variable, and show how
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223632-0500"?>calculations
            involving such variables
            <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223630-0500" content="things"?>
            become quite
            <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223655-0500" content="involved"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223657-0500"?>complicated<?oxy_insert_end?>
            very fast!</p>
<p>We'll

            move on to a special class of continuous random
            variables<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223736-0500"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223721-0500" content=" - "?>the

            random variables. Normal random variables are very
            common<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T223740-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            and play a very important role in statistical inference.</p>
<p>We'll finish this section by presenting an important connection between the binomial random variable (the special discrete random variable that we presented earlier) and the normal random variable (the special continuous random variable that we'll present here).</p>
