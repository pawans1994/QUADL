                    <feedback>Correct. Indeed, John's z-score of 2.6 indicates that his salary is
                        2.6 standard deviations above the mean. Since the mean is $27 and each
                        standard deviation is $4, we get that John's salary = 27 + 2.6(4) =
                        $37.40.</feedback>

                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. John's z-score of 2.6 indicates that his
                        score is 2.6 standard deviations above the mean. It seems like you added
                        $2.60 to the mean rather than 2.6 standard deviations. </feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. John's z-score of 2.6 indicates that his
                        score is 2.6 standard deviations above the mean. It seems like you
                        subtracted 2.6 standard deviations from the mean. </feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. John's z-score of 2.6 indicates that his
                        score is 2.6 standard deviations above the mean. It seems like you
                        subtracted $2.60 dollars from the mean instead of adding 2.6 standard
                        deviations to the mean.  </feedback>

                <hint>To figure out the hourly salary, you will need to use the mean for the hourly
                    salary rate and the z score.</hint>
