         <p>Find the probability distribution of X. In other words, list the possible values that X can have, and their corresponding probabilities.  (Hint: There are three possibilities here: no fire, total loss due to fire, 50% damage due to fire).

            <p>There are three possibilities that correspond to the three possible values of X in
                  this example. In

                  case, the insurance company is gaining the amount of the policy cost, which is
                  $1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T145040-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>350.</p>
            <p>&#8226; If there is total loss due to fire (which happens with probability .002), the
                  insurance company has to pay the customer $100,000, and therefore the company's
                  gain is:
                  $1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T145120-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>350
                  - $100,000.</p>
            <p>&#8226; If there is 50% damage due to fire (which happens with probability .008), the
                  insurance company has to pay the customer $50,000, and therefore the company's
                  gain is:
                  $1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T145137-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>350
                  - $50,000.</p>
            <p>&#8226; If there is no fire (which must happen with the "remaining probability" of 1
                  - .002 - .008 = .99), the insurance company has to pay
                  nothing<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T145158-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                  and so is left with the premium gain of
                  $1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T145201-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>350.</p>
            <p>To summarize, the probability distribution of X is:</p>
