                <feedback>Incorrect. This is the proportion of exams that are below one standard
                    deviation from the mean (exam score = 67, z = −1.00). You want to find the
                    proportion of exams that have a score above 69 points. This is equivalent to
                    finding the probability that a given exam has a score of at least 69
                    points.</feedback>

            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. It appears you switched μ and the sample mean in calculating
                    the z-score for an exam score of 69 (it should be 69 − 75 instead of 75 − 69).
                    Additionally, this is a z-score, but you want to find the proportion of exams
                    that have a score above 69 points. This is equivalent to finding the probability
                    that a given exam has a score of at least 69 points.</feedback>

                    a score <em style="italic">below</em> 69 points. You want to find the proportion
                    of exams that have scores <em style="italic">above</em> 69 points. </feedback>

                <feedback>Correct. Let the random variable <em style="bold">X</em> represent the
                    score on the exam. We are given that <em style="bold">X</em> is normal with
                    a mean of 75 and standard deviation of 8, and we need to find P(X &lt; 69).

                <feedback>Incorrect. The z-score for 69 points is −0.75. However, this is not the
                    proportion of exams that passed. Remember that a proportion can’t be negative.
                    You should find P(Z &gt; −0.75)</feedback>
