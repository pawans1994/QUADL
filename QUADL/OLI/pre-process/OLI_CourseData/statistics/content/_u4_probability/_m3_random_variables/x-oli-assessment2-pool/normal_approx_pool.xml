            <p>Colorblindness is any abnormality of the color vision system that causes a person to
                see colors differently than most people, or to have difficulty distinguishing among
                certain colors (www.visionrx.com). </p>
            <p>Colorblindness is gender-based, <!--while-->with the majority of sufferers being males. </p>
            <p>Roughly 8% of white males have some form of colorblindness, while the incidence among
                white females is only 1%. A random sample of 20 white males and 40 white females was
                chosen.</p>
            <p>Let <em style="bold">X</em> be the number of males (out of the 20) who are colorblind.</p>
            <p>Let <em style="bold">Y</em> be the number of females (out of the 40) who are colorblind.</p>
            <p>Let <em style="bold">Z</em> be the total number of colorblind individuals in the
                sample (males and females together).</p>

            <p>Left-handedness occurs in about 12% of all Americans. Males are slightly more likely
                than females to be left-handed, with 13% of males and 11% of females being
                left-handed. Suppose a random sample of 80 females and 100 males is chosen. </p>
