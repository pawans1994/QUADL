         <p>Recall that adult male height follows a normal distribution with a mean of 69 inches and
            a standard deviation of 2.8 inches.</p>
         <p>(a) How tall must a male be in order to be among the shortest 0.5% of males?</p>
         <p>(b) How tall must a male be in order to be among the tallest 0.25% of males?</p>
