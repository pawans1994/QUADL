            reviews the overwhelming scientific evidence that establishes that eyewitnesses are
            notoriously inaccurate in identifying strangers, especially under the conditions that
            exist in many serious offenses such as robbery. Many of the factors that tend to
            decrease the accuracy of an identification are intrinsic to a
            witness’<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T111801-0500" content="s"?>

            and not the product of inappropriate suggestion by the police. </p>
        <p> We know, for example, that eyewitnesses identify a known wrong person (a “filler” or
            “foil”) in approximately

        <p>Using the data that 20% of eyewitnesses identify a <em style="bold">known wrong person</em>, we wish to create
            a probability distribution and answer some probability questions.</p>
