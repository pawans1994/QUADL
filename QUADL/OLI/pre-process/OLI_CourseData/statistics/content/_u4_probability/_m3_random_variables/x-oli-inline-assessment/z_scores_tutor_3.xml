                    his hourly salary is 2.6. This means that his hourly rate is:</p></body>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. A positive z-score indicates that the value
                        is above the mean. </feedback>

                <response match="B" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. A positive z-score indicates that the value
                        is above the mean. </feedback>

                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. While it is true that John's score is above
                        average, his z-score is 2.6 standard deviations above the mean, which is
                        much above average. In particular, from the standard deviation rule, we know
                        that since John's z-score is more than 2 standard deviations above the mean,
                        his hourly rate is in the highest 2.5% of salaries.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Correct. Indeed, John's z-score is 2.6 standard deviations above the
                        mean, which is much above average. In particular, from the standard
                        deviation rule, we know that,since John's z-score is more than 2 standard
                        deviations above the mean, his hourly rate is in the highest 2.5% of
                        salaries. </feedback>
