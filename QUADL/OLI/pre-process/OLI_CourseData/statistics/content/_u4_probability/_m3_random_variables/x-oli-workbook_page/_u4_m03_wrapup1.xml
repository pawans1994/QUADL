        <p>We have finally reached the end of this module, where we were introduced to the important
            concept of <em>random variables</em>, which are quantitative variables whose value is
            determined by the outcome of a random experiment.</p>
        <p>This module was organized
            in<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T143649-0500"?>to<?oxy_insert_end?>
            two parts: one dealing with discrete random variables, and the other dealing with
            continuous random variables.</p>
        <p>We saw that all the information about a <em>discrete random variable</em> is packed into
            its probability distribution.
            Using<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T143653-0500"?>
            that,<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T143657-0500" content=" it"?>
            we can answer probability questions about the random variable and find its <em>mean

                standard deviation</em>. We ended the part on discrete random variables by
            presenting a special class of discrete random
                variables<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141505-0500"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141503-0500" content=" - t"?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141513-0500" content="he "?><em>binomial</em>
            random
            variable<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141519-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>.</p>
        <p>As we dove into <em>continuous random variables</em>,
            we<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141539-0500" content=" soon"?> saw
            how

            can get complicated very quickly, when probabilities associated with a continuous random
            variable are found by calculating <em>areas under its density curve</em>. As an example
            for a continuous random variable, we presented the <em>normal random
            variable</em><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141552-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            and discussed it at length. The normal distribution is extremely
            important<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141559-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            not
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141608-0500"?>just<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141606-0500" content="only"?>
            because many variables in real life follow the normal distribution, but mainly because
            of the important role it plays in statistical inference, our ultimate goal of this
            course.</p>
        <p>We learned how we can avoid calculus by using the <em>standard normal table</em> to find
            probabilities associated with the normal distribution, and learned how it can be used as
            an <em>approximation to the binomial</em> distribution under certain conditions. We are
            now ready to move on to the

            which can be viewed in two ways. On the one hand the
            <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141904-0500" content="&quot;"?>Sampling
            Distributions<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141907-0500" content="&quot;"?>
            module can be viewed as a special case of the

            module since we are going to discuss two special random variables: the sample mean

            and the sample proportion

            On the other hand, the
            <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T141915-0500" content="&quot;"?>Sampling

            module can be viewed as the bridge that takes us from probability to statistical
            inference.</p>
