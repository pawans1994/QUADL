      <body>
         <p>The <em style="italic">deciles</em> of any distribution are the points that mark off the highest and lowest 10% of the
            observations. How many standard deviations on either side of the mean do the deciles in
            a normal distribution lie? </p>

         <explanation>
            <p>Since the deciles mark the highest and lowest 10% of the observations, there is a
               probability of 0.8 that the random variable will get a value between them. Setting the
               flags so that there is a probability of 0.8 between them (or the closest we can get to
               0.8 using the
               applet, which is <!--.7994-->0.8015), we see that the deciles of any normal distribution lie approximately
               <!--1.28-->1.29 standard deviations below and above the mean. </p>
