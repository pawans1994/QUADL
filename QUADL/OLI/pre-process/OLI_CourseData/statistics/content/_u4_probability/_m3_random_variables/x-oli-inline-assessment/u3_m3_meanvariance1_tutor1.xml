      <body>
         <p>Recall that the mean number of defective products in an hour for Xavier's production line
            (the mean of X) was 1.8. Based on your observation, which of the following do you think
            is true about the mean of Y?</p>
      </body>
      <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
         <choice value="Res1">The mean of Y is greater than 1.8.</choice>
         <choice value="Res2">The mean of Y is less than 1.8.</choice>
         <choice value="Res3">The mean of Y is roughly equal to 1.8.</choice>
      </multiple_choice>
      <part>
         <response match="Res1" score="10">
            <feedback>Correct. The probability distribution of Y has most of the weight
               (80%) on the larger values (3, 4), while the distribution of X has most of the weight
               (70%) on the smaller values (0, 1, 2). Since the mean is an  average of the values
               weighted by their probabilities, we would expect the mean of Y to be larger than the
               mean of X, which is 1.8.</feedback>

         <response match="Res2" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect. Note that the probability distribution of Y has most of the weight

               (70%) on the smaller values (0, 1, 2). Recall that the mean of a random variable is
               an average of its values weighted by their corresponding probabilities. Please try

         <hint>Look at both distributions. Where is most of the "weight" (probability): on the
            smaller values, or on the larger values?</hint>
