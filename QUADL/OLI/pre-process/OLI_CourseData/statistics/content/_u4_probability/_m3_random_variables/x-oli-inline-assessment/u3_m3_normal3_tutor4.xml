            <feedback>Incorrect. Dan's z-score of -2.4 indicates that his score is 2.4 standard deviations below the mean. It seems like you added (rather than subtracted) 2.4 points (rather than standard deviations) to the mean. </feedback>

                  Indeed, Dan's z-score of -2.4 indicates that his score is 2.4 standard deviations
                  below the mean. Since the mean is 82 and each standard deviation is 5, we get that
                  Dan's score = 82 - 2.4(5) = 70.</feedback>

            <feedback>Incorrect. Dan's z-score of -2.4 indicates that his score is 2.4 standard deviations below the mean. It seems like you subtracted 2.4 points from the mean rather than 2.4 standard deviations. </feedback>
