			<p> Color-blindness is any abnormality of the color vision system that causes a person to see
				colors differently than most people or to have difficulty distinguishing among
				certain colors (www.visionrx.xom). </p>
			<p> Color-blindness is gender-based, with the majority of sufferers being males. </p>
			<p> Roughly 8% of white males have some form of color-blindness, while the incidence among white
				females is only 1%. </p>
			<p> A random sample of 20 white males and 40 white females was chosen. </p>
			<p> Let <em style="bold">X</em> be the number of males (out of the 20) who are color-blind. </p>
			<p> Let <em style="bold">Y</em> be the number of females (out of the 40) who are color-blind. </p>
			<p> Let <em style="bold">Z</em> be the total number of color-blind individuals in the sample
				(males and females together). </p>

						table works) we need to find the exam score such that the probability of
						getting a score below it is 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. Looking in the body of the
						table for the table entry that is closest to 0.96 (which is 0.9599) we learn
						that the exam score that we are looking for has a z-score of 1.75. This
						means that the exam score that we are looking for is 1.75 * SD above the
						mean, and therefore is: 75 + 1.75 * SD = 75 + 14 = 89. </feedback>
