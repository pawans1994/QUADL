<title>Probability Distribution (3 of 5)</title>

<body>
    
<p>In the previous two examples and activity, we needed to specify the probability distributions ourselves, based on the physical circumstances of the situation. In some situations, as in the following example, the probability distribution may be specified with an algebraic formula. Such a formula must be consistent with the constraints imposed by the laws of probability, so that the probability of each outcome must be between 0 and 1, and the probabilities of all possible outcomes together must sum to 1.</p>
<example><title>Formulas to Define Random Variables</title>

<p>A random variable X has <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101119-0500"?>a
                <?oxy_insert_end?>probability
                distribution<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101121-0500"?>
                of<?oxy_insert_end?></p>
<p>
                <em>P(X = x) =
                    <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101108-0500" comment="Where are these numbers coming from? If these are just &quot;given&quot; values, that should be stated more clearly (say, &quot;Assume that a random variable X has a  probability distribution of ...&quot; 

But if the students are supposed to understand why the formula (x + 2) / 25 works fr variables with 5 values, I think more explanation is needed."?>(x
                    + 2) / 25 for x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.<?oxy_comment_end?></em>
            </p>
<p>Show the probability distribution in a table, and verify that the above requirements are satisfied.</p>
<p>Substituting x = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, into the formula for P(X = x), we have</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image010.gif" alt="A two row probability distribution
table, in which the rows are labeled &quot;X&quot; and &quot;P(X=x).&quot; Data is given in column
oriented format (X: P(X=x)):
        1: 3/25;
        2: 4/25;
        3: 5/25;
        4: 6/25;
        5: 7/25;"/>
<p>Clearly, each probability is between 0 and 1. Also, the probabilities sum to (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) / 25 = 25/25 = 1.</p>

        <title>Probability Histograms</title>
        <body>
            <p>We learned to display the distribution of sample values for a quantitative variable
                    with a histogram<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101330-0500" content=","?>
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101343-0500"?>in which
                    the<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101346-0500" content="whose"?>
                    horizontal axis
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101358-0500"?>represented<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101402-0500" content="accounted for"?>
                    the range of values in the sample. The vertical axis represented the frequency
                    or relative frequency (sometimes given as a percentage) of sample values
                    occurring in that interval. So the width of each rectangle in the histogram was
                    an
                    interval<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101420-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    or part of the possible values for the quantitative
                    variable<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101424-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    and the height of each rectangle was the frequency (or relative frequency) for
                    that interval.</p>
              <p> Similarly, we can display the probability distribution of a random variable with a
                    probability histogram. The horizontal axis
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101458-0500"?>represents<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101501-0500" content="accounts for"?>
                    the range of all possible values of the random variable, and the vertical axis
                    represents the probabilities of those values. </p>
        </body>

 <p>Here is the probability histogram for the previous example:</p>

<section>
    <title>Area of a Probability Histogram</title>
  <body>  <p>Notice that each rectangle in the histogram has a width of
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101627-0500"?>1<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101626-0500" content="one"?>
                    unit. The height of each rectangle is the probability that it will occur. Thus,
                    the area of each rectangle is base times height, which for these rectangles is 1
                    times its probability
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101607-0500"?><?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101812-0500" comment="Please double-check -- is clarification correct?"?>f<?oxy_insert_end?>or
                    each <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T101648-0500"?>value
                    of

                    This means that the sum of the areas of all of the rectangles is the same as the
                    sum of all of the probabilities. Therefore, the total area = 1. </p></body>
