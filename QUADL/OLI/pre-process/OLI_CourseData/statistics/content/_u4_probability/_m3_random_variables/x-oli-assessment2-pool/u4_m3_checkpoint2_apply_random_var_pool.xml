        <body>Safari Adventure Theme Park is a self­guided theme park in which people drive through
            a park filled with African wildlife. They are given a map and a written guide to the
            wildlife of the park. They charge $20.00 per car plus $2.00 per person in the car. The
            number of people per car can be represented by the random variable X which has a mean
            value μ<sub>X</sub> = 3.2, and a variance σ<sup>2</sup><sub>x</sub> = 1.4. What is the
