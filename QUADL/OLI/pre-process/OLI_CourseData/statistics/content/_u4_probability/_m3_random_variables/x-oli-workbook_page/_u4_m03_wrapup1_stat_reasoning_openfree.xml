        <title>Wrap-Up (Random Variables)</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>We have finally reached the end of this module, where we were introduced to the important
            concept of <em>random variables</em>, which are quantitative variables whose value is
            determined by the outcome of a random experiment.</p>
        <p>This module was organized in two parts: one dealing with discrete random variables, and
            the other dealing with continuous random variables.</p>
        <p>We saw that all the information about a <em>discrete random variable</em> is packed into
            its probability distribution. Using it we can answer probability questions about the
            random variable and find its <em>mean and standard deviations</em>.</p>
        <p>As we dove into <em>continuous random variables</em>, we soon saw how things can get
            complicated very quickly, when probabilities associated with a continuous random
            variable are found by calculating <em>areas under its density curve</em>. As an example
            for a continuous random variable, we presented the <em>normal random variable</em> and
            discussed it at length. The normal distribution is extremely important not only because
            many variables in real life follow the normal distribution, but mainly because of the
            important role it plays in statistical inference, our ultimate goal of this course.</p>
        <p>We learned how we can avoid calculus by using the <em>normal table</em> to find
            probabilities associated with the normal distribution. We are
            now ready to move on to the "Sampling Distributions" module of probability which can be
            viewed in two ways. On the one hand the "Sampling Distributions" module can be viewed as
            a special case of the "Random Variables" module since we are going to discuss two
            special random variables: the sample mean <m:math overflow="scroll">

                    <m:mo>¯</m:mo>
                </m:mover>
            </m:math> and the sample proportion <m:math overflow="scroll">

                    </m:mrow>
                    <m:mo>ˆ</m:mo>
                </m:mover>
            </m:math>. On the other hand, the "Sampling Distributions" module can be viewed as the
            bridge that takes us from probability and to statistical inference.</p>
