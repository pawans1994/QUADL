      <body>
         <p>We found that the standard deviation of X is 1.21. Now look at both probability distributions carefully. Which of the following do you think is true about the standard deviation of Y?</p>
      </body>
      <multiple_choice shuffle="false">
         <choice value="Res1">The standard deviation of Y is greater than 1.21.</choice>
         <choice value="Res2">The standard deviation of Y is less than 1.21.</choice>
         <choice value="Res3">The standard deviation of Y is roughly equal to 1.21.</choice>
      </multiple_choice>

         <response match="Res1" score="0">
            <feedback>Incorrect.  Note that 75% of the time, Y will get the value 3, which is very close to its mean (2.7). 
               On the other hand, only 25% of time will X get the value 2, which is very close to its mean (1.8). Try again, and read the explanation below.</feedback>
