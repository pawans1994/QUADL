      <p>The number of people in a car that crosses a certain bridge is a random variable X having a
         mean value of 2.7 and variance of 1.2. The toll on the bridge is $3 per car plus $.50 (50
         cents) per person in the car.</p>

   <question id="q1">
      <body>
         <p>An expression for the amount of money that is collected from a car that crosses the
            bridge is:</p>

            <feedback>Incorrect. You are probably confusing the two types of costs.
               There is a $3 charge per car (regardless of the number of people in the car), plus
               $.50 for each person in the car. </feedback>

            <feedback>Incorrect. Note that the charge per car is $3 regardless of the number of
               people in the car. This is a fixed cost and therefore should not be multiplied by X.
               Only the $.50 charge is applied to each person in the car. </feedback>

            <feedback>Incorrect. According to your answer, the amount of money collected from a car
               is fixed at $3.50, and is not a random variable. Note that this is not the case.
               There is a fixed charge of $3 per car, but in addition there is $.50 charge for each
               person in the car, the number of which is expressed by the random variable X. </feedback>

         <p>Given your answer to the previous question, and using the first set of rules for means
            and variances, what is the mean and standard deviation of the amount of money that is
            collected from a car that crosses the bridge?</p>

            <feedback>Not quite right. While your mean is correct, the variance 3.60 isn’t. It appears that for σ<sup>2</sup><sub>3 + 0.50X</sub>, you calculated 3 + 0.50 * 1.2 = 3.60, but you forgot to square 0.50.<!--Your mistake
               is that in order to find the variance of 3 + 0.50X, you are doing: 3 + 0.50 * 1.2 =
