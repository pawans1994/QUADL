   <question id="q1">
         <body><p>John's parents are concerned because John is changing majors for the second time.  John claims this is not unusual.  Using the mean and standard deviation given above, is John's behavior unusual?</p></body>
     <short_answer id="A"/>
      <part>
         <response input="A" match="*" score="1"/>
         <explanation><p> Since the mean is 1.23 and the standard deviation is 1.08, two changes is less than 1 standard
               deviation above the mean. </p>
          <p>  1.23 + 1.08 = 2.31</p>
            <p>So, John's behavior is not unusual at all.  In fact, it is quite ordinary.</p>
