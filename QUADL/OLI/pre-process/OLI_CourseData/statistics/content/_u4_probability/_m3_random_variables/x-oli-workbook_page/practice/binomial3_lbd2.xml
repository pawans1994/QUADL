                <p>The purpose of this activity is to gain experience making probabilistic decisions
                    using binomial random variables. </p>

            <title>Background</title>
            <body>
                <p>In vitro fertilization is becoming more and more common these days. Suppose each
                    embryo that is implanted has a 20% chance of resulting in a pregnancy that
                    results in delivering a baby. Also, assume that each embryo's chance of
                    surviving and resulting in a baby is independent of the others.</p>
                <p>It is an expensive procedure, so we want to do it only once. We wish to try to
                    find the optimum number of embryos to implant so that the probability of at
                    least 1 child being born is high, but the probability of more than 2 children
                    being born is low. In other words, we want a baby, and we're willing to have
                    twins, but we don't want triplets, quadruplets, etc.</p>
                <p>Note that unlike the airline flight example, where we needed to control only one
                    probability, in this case there are two probabilities that we wish to
                    control.</p>

        <p>We will let X represent the number of implanted embryos resulting in a baby. It is a
            binomial random variable with n = number of implanted embryos and p = .20 (the
            probability that an implanted embryo results in a baby). </p>
        <p> It is customary to implant between n = 1 and n = 7 embryos. We have provided a table
            that contains the two probabilities mentioned in the previous question, for values of n
            ranging from 1 to 7.</p>
