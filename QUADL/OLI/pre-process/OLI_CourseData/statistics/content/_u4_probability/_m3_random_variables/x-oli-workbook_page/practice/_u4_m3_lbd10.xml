    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to show you how to solve word problems involving the
            normal distribution. Most statistical software packages, much like the normal table, are
            set up to give answers to problems involving "less than." This means that the software
            does the "finding z-scores and looking up the table" work for us, but we still need to
            make sure that we pose the question in terms of "less than," and/or, if needed, adjust
            the answer that the software gives us.</p>
        <p>Recall that we have two types of problems that are of interest: finding probabilities
            given values, and finding values given probabilities. Below are the instructions for
            both types. </p>
        <section>
            <title>Finding Probabilities (Given Values)</title>
            <body>
                <p>To illustrate this we'll use an example from a previous activity: Finding P(X
                    &gt; 700) where X is the SAT-M score which has a normal distribution with a mean
                    of 507 and standard deviation of 111.</p>

                            <title>R Instructions</title>
                            <p>One advantage of R is that it will find probabilities without first
                                requiring you to reduce the data to z-scores. To find the
                                probability P(X &lt; 700), start R and enter the command:</p>

                            <code>pnorm(700, mean=507, sd=111)</code>

                            <p>You should see that the probability is equal to 0.9589596. To
                                calculate the probability P(X &gt; 700) = 1 - P(X &lt; 700),
                                enter</p>

                            <code>1- pnorm(700, mean=507, sd=111)</code>

                            <p>Note that when we solved this problem using the table in an earlier
                                activity, we rounded z-scores and therefore our answer was slightly
                                different, but very close (.0409).</p>
                            <p>Similarly, if we wanted to find P(400 &lt; X &lt; 600), we would need
                                to do two separate calculations; one for P(X &lt; 600), and one for
                                P(X &lt; 400), and subtract.</p>
                            <p>Now use R to work through the following exercise:</p>

                    illustrate, we use an example from a previous activity: finding the value of x
                    that satisfies P(X &gt; x) = 0.02 where X is the SAT-M score, which has a normal
                    distribution with a mean of 507 and standard deviation of 111. Before we start,
                    it will be useful to rephrase the problem in terms of X &lt; x; we are looking
                    for the value of x that satisfies P(X &lt; x) = 0.98.</p>

                                    function is the inverse of the <code style="inline"
                                        >NORMSDIST</code> function that we used previously, and
                                    takes the place of us having to look up the z-score in a normal
                                    table. The formula we'll use is <code style="inline"
                                        >=NORMSINV(0.98)</code>. Excel tells us that the z-score is
                                    2.053748.</li>
                                <li>To calculate the X value that corresponds to that z-score, we'll
                                    again use the equation z = (X - mean)/stdev. In this case, we
                                    get X = 2.053748 * 111 + 507, or 734.966.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Excel tells us that the value that we are looking for (the 98th
                                percentile) is 734.966. Our solution in the previous activity using
                                the table gave us the answer 734.55 due to rounding.</p>
                            <p>Now use Excel to work through the following exercise:</p>
