            get a better feel for the behavior of normal random variables.</p>
        <p>* check how accurate the Standard Deviation Rule is.</p>
        <p>* do some other calculations for the normal distribution that are beyond what the
            Standard Deviation Rule can help us with.</p>
        <p>As we've seen, the Standard Deviation Rule for normal random variables is very useful.
            The following applet will help you see how accurate the rule is, and do some other
            calculations for normal distributions that cannot be done using that rule and that will
            further enhance your understanding of the normal distribution.</p>

                <p>1. Do not change the settings of the applet. </p>
                <p>2. The numbers on the horizontal axis represent the number of SD (standard
                    deviations) above or below the mean. So, 0 is the mean, +1 is one SD above the
                    mean, -1 is one SD below the mean, etc. </p>

        <p>To see how accurate the Standard Deviation Rule is, drag one flag across the other, so
            that the applet shows the area under the curve <em>between </em>the two flags.</p>

                <p>If you drag the flags across each other again, you'll be able to see the
                    probabilities in the tails (above and below 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from
                    the mean). Recall that we mentioned that according to the Standard Deviation
                    Rule, these tails have probabilities .16, .025 and .0015, corresponding to 1, 2
                    and 3 standard deviations from the mean). Try it. </p>

        <p>Recall from the EDA section the quartiles Q1 and Q3. In the context of random variables,
            Q1 is the value such that P(X &lt; Q1) = .25. In other words, the random variable has a
            25% chance of having a value that is below Q1. Similarly, Q3 is the value such that P(X
            &lt; Q3) = .75. In other words, the random variable has a 75% chance of having a value
            below Q3. Another way to think about the quartiles is that they mark the highest and
            lowest 25% of the distribution. </p>
