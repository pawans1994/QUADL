        <title>Binomial Random Variables</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to give guided practice at solving problems involving
            binomial random variables and to teach how the same probabilities can be found using a
            statistical software package.</p>
        <p>A multiple choice test has 10 questions, each with 5 possible answers, only one of which
            is correct. A student who did not study is absolutely clueless, and therefore uses an
            independent random guess to answer each of the 10 questions.</p>

        <p><em style="bold">Let X be the number of questions the student gets right.</em></p>

        <p>Applying the binomial formula is a good way for "first-timers" to understand the
            mechanics of binomial probabilities. Once you have mastered the technique, however, it
            may still be tedious to perform the necessary calculations.</p>
        <p>For example, if I would ask you: What is the probability that the student will get at
            most 4 questions right? Or in other words, if we wanted to find P(X ≤ 4), we would need
            to add P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4).</p>
        <p>For each of these 5 probabilities, we would need to use the formula, and then add the
            probabilities. This is very tedious. When calculations involve large n values,
            calculations become tedious as well. Luckily, any statistical software will do binomial
            calculations for us.</p>
