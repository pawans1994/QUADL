<title>Rules for Means and Variances of Random Variables</title>
<body>
<p>So far we've learned how to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a random variable, and
                    how to interpret these numerical measures.

<example><title>Xavier's Production Line</title>

<p>Assume that operating Xavier's production line costs $50 per hour, and that the repair cost of one defective part is $5. 
    If X is the number of defective parts produced per hour, then the hourly cost would be <em>50 + 5X</em>. Note that since X is a random variable, 
    so is the cost, 50 + 5X, and we might be interested in the mean and standard deviation of the hourly cost of operation for Xavier's production line. </p>

                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T171435-0500"?>the

                is there an easy way to find the mean and standard deviation for

<title>In General</title>
<body>
<p>Sometimes a new random variable of interest arises when we take an existing random variable and multiply by a constant and/or add a constant to its values. In the example above, we both multiplied X by 5 and added 50.  
    We will return to the above example after exploring how such changes affect the center (mean) and spread (standard deviation) of random variables in general.</p>
<p>Consider the random variable X with
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T171549-0500"?>a
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>probability distribution as shown in the histogram below:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image055.gif" alt="A histogram in which the vertical axis
is labeled &quot;Probability&quot; and the horizontal axis is labeled &quot;X.&quot; Here is the
data represented by the histogram:
        P(X = -2) = 0.1;
        P(X = -1) = 0.1;
        P(X = 0) = 0.6;
        P(X = 1) = 0.1;
        P(X = 2) = 0.1;
        So, the histogram is entire flat with probability = 0.1, except at X=0, where probability
is 0.6"/>
<p>It can easily be shown that X has
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T171556-0500"?>a

<p>What would the mean and standard deviation be if we shifted the entire histogram over 6 units to
                    the
                    right<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T171706-0500"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T171656-0500" content="---"?>in

<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image056.gif" alt="The same histogram, except that the bars
have been shifted over 6 units. This that the data now represented is:
        P(X = 4) = 0.1;
        P(X = 5) = 0.1;
        P(X = 6) = 0.6;
        P(X = 7) = 0.1;
        P(X = 8) = 0.1;"/>
<p>We observe that shifting the distribution over to the right 6 units also shifts the center over 6 units: in other words, the mean of (X + 6) should equal the (mean of X) + 6. 
    However, the spread of the distribution is unchanged: in other words, the standard deviation of (X + 6) should equal the standard deviation of X.</p>
<p>Again consider the random variable X with

    <p>Multiplying X by 4 results in a mean that is 4 times the original mean. In this case, the
