        <body>
            <p><em>(d)</em> How likely or unlikely is a male's foot length to be smaller than 9.5
                inches? Not too unlikely, since the probability of being smaller than 9.5 is
                    <input_ref input="A"/>, which is not a particularly low probability.</p>
            <p><em>(e)</em> How likely or unlikely is a foot length longer than 15.5 inches? Extremely
                unlikely, since the probability of being longer than 15.5 is only <input_ref
                    input="B"/>.</p>
            <p><em>(f)</em> There is probability of 0.5 that a male's foot is shorter than
                    <input_ref input="C"/>.</p>
