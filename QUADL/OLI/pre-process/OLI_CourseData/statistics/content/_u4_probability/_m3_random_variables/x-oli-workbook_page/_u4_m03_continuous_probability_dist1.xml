<title>The Probability Distribution of a Continuous Random Variable</title>
<body>
<p>In order to shift our focus from discrete to continuous random variables, let us first consider
                    the probability histogram below for
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T224132-0500"?>the
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>shoe size of adult males. Let X represent these shoe sizes.
                    Thus, X is a discrete random variable, since shoe sizes can only take whole and
                    half number values, nothing in between.</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image100.gif" alt="A histogram for male shoe sizes. The vertical
axis is labeled &quot;Probability&quot; and the horizontal axis is labeled &quot;Male shoe size&quot;.
Moving from left to right across the horizontal axis, we start at size=6.5, where the probability is
very low, below .02 . From there, the probabilities grow until size=11, where probability is at about .20
. Then, as sizes increase, probability decreases. The axis ends at size = 15.5 . The histogram makes a
typical normal shape."/>
<p>Recall that in all of the previous probability histograms we've seen, the X-values were whole numbers.  
    Thus, the width of each bar was 1. The height of each bar was the same as the probability for its corresponding X-value. 
    Due to the principle that states the sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes in the sample space must be 1, 
    the <em>heights</em> of all the rectangles in the histogram must sum to 1. This meant that the area was also 1. </p>
    
    <p>This histogram uses half-sizes. We wish to keep the area = 1, but we still want the
                    horizontal scale to represent half-sizes. Therefore, we must adjust the vertical
                    scale of the histogram. As is, the total area of the histogram rectangles would
                    be .50 times the sum of the probabilities, since the width of each bar is .50.
                    Thus, the area is .50(1) = .50. If we double the vertical scale, the area will
                    double and be
                    1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T224240-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    just like we want. This means we are changing the vertical scale from
                    "Probability" to "Probability per half size." The shape and the horizontal scale
                    remain unchanged.</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image101.gif" alt="The same histogram as the previous one, except
that the vertical axis has been changed. It is now labeled &quot;Probability per half size&quot;, and now
the units are half as large, so that at size = 11, probability is .40 . We also see that the area for all
of the bars using this new vertical axis is 1."/>
<p> Now we can tell the probability of shoe size taking a value in any interval, just by finding the area of the rectangles over that interval. 
    For instance, the area of the rectangles up to and including 9 shows the probability of having a shoe size less than or equal to 9.</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image102.gif" alt="The same histogram as the previous one, but the
bars for sizes 6.5 to 9 have been shaded. The area of the shading is the Probability of shoe size less than
or equal to 9."/>
<p>Recall that for a discrete random variable like shoe size, the probability is affected by whether
                    we want strict inequality or not. For example, the
                    area<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T224336-0500"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T224334-0500" content=" --"?>and
                    corresponding
                    probability<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T224341-0500"?>&#8212;<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T224339-0500" content="--"?>is
                    reduced if we only consider shoe sizes strictly less than 9:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image103.gif" alt="The histogram now only has the bars for shoe
sizes 6.5 though 8.5 shaded. The shaded area is the Probability of shoe size &lt; 9."/>

        <title>Transition to Continuous Random Variables</title>
        <body>
    
    
    <p>Now we are going to be making the transition from <em>discrete</em> to <em>continuous</em> random variables.  Recall that continuous random variables 
    represent measurements and can take on any value within an interval.  </p>
    <p>For our shoe size example, this would mean measuring shoe sizes in smaller units<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T224657-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T224701-0500"?>such
                    as<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T224659-0500" content="like"?>
                    tenths<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T224706-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    or hundredths. As the number of intervals increases, the width of the bars
                    becomes narrower and narrower, and the graph approaches a smooth curve. </p>
    <p>To illustrate this, the following graphs represent two steps in this process of narrowing the widths of the intervals.  Specifically, the interval widths are 
    .25 and .10.</p>
      <p>
          <image src="../webcontent/image_spacer.gif" style="inline" width="25" height="155" alt="white space"></image>

              alt="The histogram of shoe size probability with interval widths of .25 . We have twice as many bars, which more closely
approximate a curve, since they are half as wide, and on average, the difference in probability between neighboring bars has been halved.
An actual curve has also been drawn on top of the histogram, showing that the histogram is getting closer to being a curve."></image>
          <image src="../webcontent/image_spacer.gif" style="inline" width="25" height="155" alt="white space"></image>
          <image src="../webcontent/image_shoe_male2.jpg" style="inline" width="346" height="233"
              alt="The histogram of shoe size probability with interval widths of .10 . We have many bars now, so many that the individual
bars have small deviations from the general normal histogram shape. From a distance it the histogram almost looks like a curve, and up close,
some bars are deviating from the normal histogram shape. For example, on the left side of the histogram, where the bars should be increasing
in height as we go right, there is an occasional bar which is lower. However, due to the decreased bar width, this histogram more closely
resembles a curve. An actual curve has also been drawn on top of the histogram, showing that the histogram is getting closer to being a curve."></image>
      </p>
            <p>We'll use these smooth curves to represent the probability distributions of continuous random variables.  This idea will be discussed 
           in more detail on the next page.</p>
