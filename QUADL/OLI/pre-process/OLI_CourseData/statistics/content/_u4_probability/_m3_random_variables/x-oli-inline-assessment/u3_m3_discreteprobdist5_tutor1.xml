            <feedback>Incorrect. 12/50 is P(X = 1), the probability of exactly one sale. We are
                  looking for the probability of at least one sale, which is P(X ≥ 1). Please try
                  again.</feedback>

            <feedback>Incorrect. 22/50 is P(X ≤ 1), the probability of no more than
                  one sale. We are looking for the probability of at least one sale, which is P(X ≥
                  1). Please try again.</feedback>

            <feedback>Incorrect. 28/50 is P(X &gt; 1), the probability of more than one sale. We are looking for the probability of at least one sale, which is P(X ≥ 1). Please try again.</feedback>

            <feedback>Correct. The probability of at least one sale is P(X ≥ 1) = P(X = 1) + P(X =
                  2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) = (12 + 12 + 10 + 6) / 50 = 40/50, (using the addition
                  principle). Alternatively (and more efficiently), you can use complements and the
                  fact that the complementary event of X ≥ 1 is X = 0. Therefore, P(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X
                  = 0) = 1 - 10/50 = 40/50.</feedback>

            <feedback>Incorrect. 10/50 is P(X &lt; 1), which in this case is P(X = 0), the probability of less than one sale. We are looking for the probability of at least one sale, which is P(X ≥ 1). Please try again.</feedback>
