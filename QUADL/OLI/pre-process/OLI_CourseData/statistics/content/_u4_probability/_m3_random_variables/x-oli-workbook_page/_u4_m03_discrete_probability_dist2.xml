<p>The probability distribution for two flips of a coin was simple enough to construct at once. For more complicated random experiments, it is common to first construct a table of all the outcomes in S and their probabilities, then use the addition principle to condense that information into the actual probability distribution table.</p>
<example><title>Flipping a Coin Three Times</title>

<p>A coin is tossed three times. Let the random variable X be the number of tails. Find the probability distribution of X. We'll follow the same reasoning we used in the previous example:</p>
<p>First, we specify the 8 possible outcomes in S, along with the number and the probability of that
                outcome.

                they are all equally likely, each has probability 1/8. Alternatively, by the
                multiplication principle, each particular sequence of three coin faces has
                probability 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 =
                1/8.<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T094305-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T094304-0500" content="]"?></p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image006.gif" alt="A table with two columns, labeled
&quot;Outcome,&quot; and &quot;Probability.&quot; Here is the data, arranged by row:
            HHH: &frac12; &times; &frac12; &times; &frac12; = 1/8;
            HHT: 1/8;
            HTH: 1/8;
            THH: 1/8;
            HTT: 1/8;
            THT: 1/8;
            TTH: 1/8;
            TTT: 1/8;"/>
<p>Next, we figure out what the value of X is (number of tails) for each possible outcome.</p>
    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image007.gif" alt="A table with three columns, labeled
&quot;Outcome,&quot; and &quot;Probability,&quot; and &quot;X.&quot; The data is the same as in
the previous table execpt the &quot;X&quot; column has been added. Here is the data, arranged by
row (Outcome: Probability, X):
        HHH: 1/8, 0;
        HHT: 1/8, 1;
        HTH: 1/8, 1;
        THH: 1/8, 1;
        HTT: 1/8, 2;
        THT: 1/8, 2;
        TTH: 1/8, 2;
        TTT: 1/8, 3"/>
<p>Next, we use the addition principle to assert that</p>
<p>P(X = 1) = P(HHT or HTH or THH) = P(HHT) + P(HTH) + P(THH) = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 3/8.</p>
<p>Similarly, P(X = 2) = P(HTT or THT or TTH) = 3/8.</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image008a.gif" alt="The previous table, annotated
with the calculations to calculate P(X=x). For P(X=0), there is only one outcome in the table,
so P(X=0) = 1/8. For P(X=1), there are thee outcomes, so P(X=1) = 3 &times; 1/8 = 3/8. The
same thing happens for P(X=2) = 3 &times; 1/8 = 3/8. For P(X=3), there is only one case so
P(X=3) = 1/8."/>
<p> The resulting probability distribution is:</p>

      <body>
          <p>A young couple decides to try to have children until they have a boy. For financial
                    reasons, the couple decides that they are going to stop trying when they have
                    three
                    children<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T094426-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    whether they have a boy or not. (We are assuming that having a boy or a girl is
                    equally

                    and that the child's gender in each birth is independent of

          <p>Let the random variable X be the number of children the couple has.</p>
          <p>Our goal is to find the probability distribution of X. In other words, we would like to create a table that lists all the possible values of X and the corresponding probabilities.  We'll follow the same steps we followed in the two examples we solved.</p>
