            <p>Suppose the time to complete a 200-meter backstroke swim for female competitive
                swimmers is normally distributed with a mean μ = 141 seconds and a standard
                deviation σ = 7 seconds.</p>
            <p>What is the completion time for the 200-meter backstroke for a female with a z-score
                of −1.64? (Round answer to 1 decimal place.)</p>

                <feedback>Incorrect. It looks like you calculated the time for a z-score of −1.46
                    instead of −1.64. Remember, to find the observation corresponding to a z-score
                    calculate mean + z-score * SD.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. A z-score of −1.64 means that the actual time is 1.64 standard
                    deviations below the mean, and therefore the time we are looking for is mean
                    −1.64 * SD = 141 − 1.64 * 7 = 129.52 or 129.5.</feedback>

            <response match="C" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. This z-score is negative, so the time should be below the mean
                    of 141 seconds. It looks like you calculated the time for a z-score of 1.64
                    instead of −1.64. Remember, to find the observation corresponding to a z-score
                    calculate mean + z-score * SD. </feedback>

            <response match="D" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. This is the mean completion time which has a z-score of 0.
                    Since the z-score is negative, the time associated with this z-score should be
                    less than the mean completion time. Remember, to find the observation
                    corresponding to a z-score calculate: MEAN + z-score * SD </feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Since the z-score is positive, the exam score associated with

                    for is mean + 1.25 * SD = 75 + 1.25 * 8 = 85. </feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. It seems that you have found the proportion of exams that have
                    an associated z-score of at most 1.25. However, you should find the exam score
                    associated with a z-score of 1.25.</feedback>
