            <p>The number of people in a car that crosses a certain bridge is represented by the
                random variable X, which has a mean value &#x3BC;<sub>X</sub> = 2.7, and a variance
                    &#x3C3;<sup>2</sup><sub>X</sub> = 1.2. The toll on the bridge is $3.00 per car
                plus $0.50 per person in the car.</p>
            <p>What is the mean of the total amount of money that is collected from a car that
                crosses the bridge? Report your answer to two decimal places. Do NOT include a
                dollar sign ($) when reporting your answer.</p>

                <feedback>Correct. Let T be the total amount of money that is collected from a car

                    3 + 0.50 * X. To find the mean of T you use the rule of means:
                        μ<sub>(a+bX)</sub> = a + b μ<sub>X</sub> = 3 + 0.5(2.7) = 3 + 0.5(2.7) =
