        <p>Length (in days) of human pregnancies is a normal random variable (X) with mean 266, standard deviation 16.</p>
        <p>(It would be useful to sketch this normal distribution yourself, marking its mean and the
            values that are 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations below and above the mean. Click <link
