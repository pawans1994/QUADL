    <content><p>Suppose we have three randomly selected lineups. Let I represent an incorrect identification.</p> 
        <p>Note: The complement of I is that an incorrect identification <em style="bold">has not occurred</em>.  
            This means that in any randomly selected lineup either the correct person or nobody was identified. In either case nothing incorrect has happened.  
            So, for simplicity, let C represent the complement of I.</p></content>
<question id="q1">
    <body>What is the sample space for this experiment?</body>
    <short_answer id="A"/>    
    
    <part><response input="A" match="*" score="1"/>
          <hint>Each result has three trials.  Each trial is either an "I" or a "C."  One possible element in the sample space is III.</hint>
        <explanation><p>Each outcome for each trial is either an "I" or a "C."  We have three trials.</p>
            <p>Thus, the sample space is:</p>
        <p>III, IIC, ICI, ICC</p>
            <p>CII, CIC, CCI, and CCC</p>
