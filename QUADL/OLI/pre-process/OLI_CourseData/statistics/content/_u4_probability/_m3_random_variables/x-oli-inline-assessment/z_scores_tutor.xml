                <p>The hourly salary rate for accountants at the “We are the Best Accounting Firm”
                    follow a normal distribution, with a mean of $27 and a standard deviation of
                    $4.</p>
                <p>Tom earns $22.50 an hour. His z score is:</p>

                <choice value="A">22.50</choice>
                <choice value="B">-1.125</choice>

                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. 22.50 is Tom’s raw score, or the actual
                        amount he earns, per hour. Recall that the z-score of a normal value is
                        (value - mean) / standard deviation. Please try again.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. Indeed, Tom's z-score = (22.50-27)/4 = -1.125</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. It seems like you started well by calculating
                        the difference (value - mean) = 22.50 - 27 = 4.50. Recall however that
                        z-score is calculated: (value - mean) / standard deviation.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="D" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. It seems like your mistake is that you
                        calculated: (mean - value) / standard deviation. You switched "mean" and
                        "value." Note that z-scores are calculated: (value - mean) / standard
                        deviation. Please try again.</feedback>
                </response>
                <hint>You are trying to calculate the z score.</hint>
                <hint>A z score is calculated by using the hourly rate of the “We are the Best
                    Accounting Firm” and Tom’s hourly rate.</hint>
