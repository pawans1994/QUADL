   <question id="q1">
      <body>
         <p>What is the probability that a randomly chosen student (from all those taking the SAT-M
               that year) scored above 700? In other words, what proportion of students who took the
               SAT scored above 700? Yet another, more technical way to ask this question is, What
               is P(X &gt; 700), where X represents the random variable SAT-M score?</p>

            <p>We are given that the random variable X representing the SAT-M score has a normal
                  distribution with a mean of 507 and a standard deviation of 111, and we are asked
                  to find P(X &gt; 700). The z-score of 700 is (700 − 507)/111 = 1.74
                  (rounded), and therefore:</p>
            <p>P(X &gt; 700) = P(Z &gt; 1.74) = (by symmetry) P(Z &lt; −1.74) = (using the table) 0.0409.</p>
            <p>We conclude that roughly 4.1% of the students score above 700 on the SAT-M.</p>
