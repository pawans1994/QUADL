<title>Probability Distribution</title>
<body>
<p>When we learned how to find probabilities by applying the basic principles, we generally focused
                    on just one particular outcome or
                    event<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T093044-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T093045-0500" content=" -"?>
                    like the probability of getting exactly one tail when a coin is tossed twice, or
                    the probability of getting a

                    when a die is rolled. Now that we have mastered the solution of individual
                    probability problems, we'll proceed to look at the big picture by considering
                    all the possible values of a discrete random variable, along with their
                    associated probabilities. This list of possible values and probabilities is
                    called the <em>probability distribution</em> of the random variable. </p>

                    unit of this course, we often looked at the distribution of sample values in a
                    quantitative data set. We would display the values with a histogram, and
                    summarize them by reporting their mean. In this section, when we look at the
                    probability distribution of a random variable, we consider all its possible
                    values and their overall probabilities of occurrence. Thus, we have in mind an
                    entire population of values for a variable. When we display them with a
                    histogram or summarize them with a mean, these are representing a population of
                    values, not a sample. The distinction between sample and population is an
                    essential concept in statistics, because an ultimate goal is to draw conclusions
                    about unknown values for a population, based on what is observed in the
                    sample.</p>

  <p>Recall our first
            example<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T093243-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            when we introduced the idea of a random variable. In this example we tossed a coin
            twice. </p>  
    <example><title>Flipping a Coin Twice</title>

<p>What is the probability distribution of X, where the random variable X is the number of tails appearing in two tosses of a fair coin?</p>
<p>We first note that since the coin is fair, each of the four outcomes HH, HT, TH, TT in the sample
                space S is equally likely, and so each has
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T093312-0500"?>a

                of<?oxy_insert_end?> 1/4.
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T093322-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T093322-0500" content="["?>Alternatively,
                the multiplication principle can be applied to find the probability of each outcome
                to be 1/2 * 1/2 =

<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image001.gif" alt="In each outcome, the first letter
represents the first coin toss and the second represents the second coin toss. Each of the
outcomes HH, HT, TH, and TT have 1/4 chance of happening."/>
<p>X takes the value 0 only for the outcome HH, so the probability that X = 0 is 1/4. </p>
        <p>X takes the value 1 for outcomes HT or TH.  By the addition principle, the probability that X = 1 is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.</p>
 <p>   Finally, X takes the value 2 only for the outcome TT, so the probability that X = 2 is 1/4. </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image002.gif" alt="A visual diagram for the mapping of outcomes
to values of X."/>
<p>The <em>probability distribution of the random variable X</em> is easily summarized in a table:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image003.gif" alt="This table has two rows, labeled &quot;x&quot;
and &quot;P(X=x).&quot; The row for &quot;x&quot; represents the list of possible values, and the row for
&quot;P(X=x)&quot; represents the probability of each value. Here is the data in the table, organized by column
and presented in &quot;x: P(X=x)&quot; order:
        0: &frac14;;
        1: &frac12;;
        2: &frac14;;" />
</example>
<p>As mentioned before, we write "P(X = x)" to denote "the probability that the random variable X takes the value x."</p>
<p>The way to interpret this table is:</p>
<p>X takes the values 0, 1, 2 and P(X = 0) = 1/4, P(X = 1) = 1/2, P(X = 2) = 1/4.</p>
<p>Note that events of the type (X = x) are subject to the principles of probability established
            earlier<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T093533-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            and will provide us with a way of systematically exploring the behavior of random
            variables. In particular, the first two principles in the context of probability
