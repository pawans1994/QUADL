                <feedback>Correct. The given range 6.8 to 9.2 is within 1 standard deviation of the
                    mean, so the probability battery life will lie in this range is 0.68.</feedback>

                    the value 6.8 and 9.2 are and then use the standard deviation rule to determine

                <feedback>Correct. 10.4 is 2 standard deviations above the mean of 8. To calculate
                    probability above this point: 1 − 0.95 = 0.05/2 = 0.025.</feedback>
