<p>So far, we have used the normal table to find a probability, given the number
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T120009-0500"?>(<?oxy_insert_end?>z<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T120010-0500"?>)<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    of standard deviations below or above the mean. The solution process involved
                    first locating the given z value of the form *.** in the margins, then finding
                    the corresponding probability of the form .**** inside the table as our answer.
                    Now, in Example 2, a probability will be given and we will be asked to find a z
                    value. The solution process involves first locating the given probability of the
                    form .**** inside the table, then finding the corresponding z value of the form
                    *.** as our answer.</p>
<example>

<p>(a) The probability is .01 that a standardized normal variable takes a value below what particular value of z?</p>
<p>The closest we can come to a probability of .01 inside the table is .0099, in the z = -2.3 row
                        and .03 column: z = -2.33. In other words, the probability is .01 that
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T120319-0500"?>the
                        value of <?oxy_insert_end?>a normal variable is
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T120315-0500"?>lower<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T120312-0500" content="less"?>
                        than 2.33 standard deviations below its mean.</p>

<p>Our standard normal table, like most, only provides probabilities for z values between -3.49 and +3.49. The following example demonstrates how to handle cases where z exceeds 3.49 in absolute value.</p>
<example>

<p><em>(a)</em> What is the probability of a normal variable being
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121448-0500"?>lower<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121446-0500" content="less"?>
                        than 5.2 standard deviations below its mean?</p>
<p>There is no need to panic about going "off the edge" of the normal table. We already know from
                        the Standard Deviation Rule that the probability is only about (1 - .997) /
                        2 = .0015 that a normal value would be more than 3 standard deviations away
                        from its mean in one direction or the other. The table provides information
                        for z values as extreme as plus or minus 3.49: the probability is only .0002
                        that a normal variable would be
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121438-0500"?>lower<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121436-0500" content="less"?>
                        than 3.49 standard deviations below its mean. Any more standard deviations
                        than that, and we generally say the probability is approximately zero.</p>
<p>In this case, we would say the probability of being
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121541-0500"?>lower<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121539-0500" content="less"?>
                        than 5.2 standard deviations below the mean is approximately zero:</p>
<p>P(Z &lt; -5.2) = 0 (approx.)</p>
<p><em>(b)</em> What is the probability of
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121822-0500"?>the
                        value of <?oxy_insert_end?>a normal variable being
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121834-0500"?>higher<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121836-0500" content="greater"?>
                        than 6 standard deviations below its mean?</p>
<p>Since the probability of being
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121859-0500"?>lower<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121857-0500" content="less"?>
                        than 6 standard deviations below the mean is approximately zero, the
                        probability of being
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121912-0500"?>higher<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T121910-0500" content="greater"?>
                        than 6 standard deviations below the mean must be approximately 1. P(Z &gt;
                        -6) = 1 (approx.)</p>
<p><em>(c)</em> What is the probability of a normal variable being less than 8 standard deviations above the mean? Approximately 1. P(Z &lt; +8) = 1 (approx.)</p>
<p><em>(d)</em> What is the probability of a normal variable being greater than 3.5 standard deviations above the mean? Approximately 0. P(Z &gt; +3.5) = 0 (approx.)</p>
