        <body>Suppose Blue Cab Company charges $2.85 a ride up to 0.1 miles and $0.30 for each

                <feedback>Incorrect. Let T be the total amount of the cab fare. It looks as though
                    you used the equation μ<sub>(a+bX)</sub> = a + b μ<sub>X</sub> but you used b =
                    $0.30 which is the price per 1/10 of a mile not the price per mile. The pricing
                    is given in miles, not 1/10 of miles so we need to set b = $3.00. It is also
                    important to note that μ<sub>X</sub> = 5.3 − 0.1 = 5.2 because the $2.85
                    includes the first 0.1 miles of the trip.</feedback>

            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. The key was to convert the rate to dollars per mile from dollars
                    per tenth of a mile so <em style="bold">b</em> = 3 and to set μ<sub>X</sub> =
                    5.3 − 0.1 = 5.2 since the first 10th of a mile was included in the fixed fee.
                    Therefore, the mean is $2.85 + $3.00(5.2) = 2.85 + 15.60 = $18.45.</feedback>

                    you forgot to compensate for the fact that the first 1/10 mile was included in
                    the $2.85 fixed fee, so μ<sub>X</sub> = 5.3 − 0.1 = 5.2.</feedback>
