<p>We've seen how probability distributions are created<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105426-0500"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105425-0500" content=","?>

            it's time to use them to find probabilities.</p>
<example><title>Changing Majors</title>
<p>A random sample of graduating seniors was surveyed just before graduation.  One question that was asked is:  How many times did you change majors?  The results 
are displayed in a probability distribution.</p>
    <image src="../webcontent/image_prob_dist_chg_major.gif" alt="A probability distribution table in
which the rows are labeled quot; and &quot;P(X = x)&quot;. Here is the data in the table, given in
column format (x: P(X=x)):
        0: .28;
        1: .37;
        2: .23;
        3: .09;
        4: .02;
        5: .01;"></image>
   
    <p>Using this probability distribution we can answer probability questions such as:  What is the probability that a randomly selected senior has changed majors more than once?  This can be written as P(X > 1).</p>
    <p>More than once would be translated to:  </p>
   <table rowstyle="plain">
       <tr><td align="right">P(X > 1)</td> <td align="center">=</td>   <td align="left">  P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)</td></tr>
   <tr><td></td> <td align="center">=</td><td align="left"> .23 + .09 + .02 + .01</td></tr>
       <tr><td></td> <td align="center">=</td> <td align="left">  .35</td></tr>

    <p>As you just
            saw<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105535-0500" content="/noticed"?> in
            this example, we need to pay attention to the wording of the probability question. The
            key words that told us which values to use for X are <em>more than</em>. The following
            will clarify and reinforce the <em>key words</em> and their
            meaning<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105609-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>.</p>

    <title>Key Words</title>
    <body>
      <p>Let's begin with some everyday situations using <em>at least</em> and <em>at most</em>. </p>
        <p>Suppose someone said to you, "I
                    need<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105630-0500"?> you to write<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    <em>at least 10 pages</em> for a term paper." What does this mean? It means that
                    10 pages is the smallest amount you are going to write. In other words, you will <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105714-0500"?>write<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105713-0500" content="use"?>
                    <em>10 or more</em> pages
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105722-0500"?>for<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105721-0500" content="in"?>
                    the term paper. This
                    would<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105732-0500" content=" also"?>
                    be the same as saying,
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105740-0500"?>"<?oxy_insert_end?><em>not
                        less than</em> 10
                    pages.<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105745-0500"?>"<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    So, for example, writing 9 pages would be unacceptable.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, suppose you are considering the number of children you will have. You
                    want <em>at most 3 children</em>. This means that 3 children is the most that
                    you wish to have. In other words, you will have <em>3 or fewer</em> children.
                    This would
                    <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105817-0500" content="also "?>be
                    the same as saying,
                        <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105822-0500"?>"<?oxy_insert_end?><em>not
                        more than</em> 3
                    children.<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105826-0500"?>"<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    So, for example, you would not want to have 4 children.</p>
        <p>The following table gives a list of some key words to know. Suppose a random variable X
                    had possible values of
                    0<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105840-0500" content=" "?>-<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T105842-0500" content=" "?>5.</p>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Key Words</th> <th>Meaning</th> <th>Symbols</th> <th>Values for X</th> </tr>
            <tr><td>more than 2</td> <td>strictly larger than 2</td> <td>X > 2</td> <td>3, 4, 5</td></tr>
            <tr><td>no more than 2</td> <td>2 or fewer</td> <td> X ≤ 2</td> <td>0, 1, 2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>fewer than 2</td> <td>strictly smaller than 2</td>  <td> X &lt; 2 </td> <td>0, 1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>no less than 2</td> <td>2 or more</td> <td> X ≥ 2</td>  <td>2, 3, 4, 5</td></tr>
            <tr><td>at least 2</td> <td>2 or more</td> <td> X ≥ 2  </td>  <td>2, 3, 4, 5</td></tr>
            <tr><td>at most 2</td> <td>2 or fewer</td> <td> X ≤ 2 </td>  <td>0, 1, 2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>exactly 2</td> <td>2, no more or no less, only 2</td>  <td> X = 2 </td>  <td>2</td></tr>

        <answer>P(X ≥ 2) = .35.  So, 35% of the time a student changes majors 2 or more times.  This means that it is not unusual to do so. </answer>
