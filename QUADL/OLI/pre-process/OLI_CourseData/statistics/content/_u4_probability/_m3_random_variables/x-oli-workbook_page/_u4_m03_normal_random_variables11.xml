<p>It is possible to improve the normal approximation to the binomial by adjusting for the
                    discrepancy that arises when we make the shift from
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T140139-0500"?>the
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>areas of histogram rectangles to
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T140143-0500"?>the
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>area under a smooth curve. For example, if we want to find the
                    binomial probability that X is less than <em>or equal to</em> 8, we are
                    including the area of the entire rectangle over 8, which actually extends to
                    8.5. Our normal approximation only included the area up to 8. The figure below
                    illustrates this:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image186.gif" alt="The probability histogram with a normal
distribution curve drawn over it. The vertical axis is labeled &quot;Probability&quot; and horizontal
axis is for X. The histogram and curve are the same as the previously shown ones, with a mean of 10
and standard deviation of 2.24 . Since the histogram uses bars, there is a bar which is centered over
X=8 . It has a width of 1, so the bar's boundaries are actually 7.5 and 8.5. Thus, in order to calculate
P(X &le; 8), we get the area of all the bars for X=0 to X=8. This means for X=8, we are getting the area
of the bar which is P(X = 8) high and 1 wide. In contrast, for the curve, we get the area under the
curve to the left of X = 8. This means we do not capture the area in the bar for X=8 from X=8 to X=8.5,
since that half of the bar is outside of the normal curve's approximated area."/>
<p>It can be improved upon by making the <em>continuity correction:</em>

</m:math>, which is much closer to the actual binomial probability of .2517 than our original approximation (.1867) was.</p>
<p>Similarly, suppose I wanted to answer: What is the probability that the student gets at least 13 questions right?</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image188.gif" alt="The same histogram as above, but in this
case we are trying to find P(X &ge; 13). So, the curve has shaded in the area to the right of X=13.
The histogram has shaded in the bars for X=13 through X=20. The approximation that the curve provides
does not cover the left half of the bar for X=13, because the bar for X=13 starts at X=12.5 and ends at
X=13.5, so it misses X=12.5 thourgh X=13 . This missing area makes the approximation worse."/>
<p>Here, to calculate the exact probability we are including the area of the entire rectangle over 13, which actually starts from 12.5. 
    Our normal approximation only included the area from 13. The continuity correction in this case would be:</p>

                            are left-handed. Most academic institutions, therefore, try to have at
                            least a few left-handed chairs in each classroom. 225 students are about
                            to enter a lecture hall that has 30 left-handed chairs for a lecture.
