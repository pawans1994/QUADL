   <p>Choose a college student at random.  Decide whether each of the following is a discrete or continuous random variable:</p>
   <p>1. The number of courses the student takes this semester: <input_ref input="A"/></p>
   <p>2. The student's height: <input_ref input="B"/></p>
   <p>3. The student's (exact) body temperature: <input_ref input="C"/></p>
   <p>4. The number of siblings the student has: <input_ref input="D"/></p>
   <p>5. The (exact) time the student spends doing school work during a week: <input_ref input="E"/></p>
   <p>6. The number of alcoholic beverages that the student drinks in a typical week: <input_ref input="F"/></p>
