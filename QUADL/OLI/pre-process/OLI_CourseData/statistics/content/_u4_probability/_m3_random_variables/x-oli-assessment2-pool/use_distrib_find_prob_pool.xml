                    week there are at least 3 items sold. Recall that you want to find, given that 3
                    items have already sold, the probability that less than 5 items will be sold in
                    the entire week.</feedback>

                <feedback>Correct. We are given that 3 items have already sold. In other words, we
                    are given X ≥ 3, and we need to find how likely X is to be less than 5. <image style="block" src="../webcontent/handwritten.png" /></feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. Notice that the maximum number of items sold in a week in this distribution is 6. This implies that the average number of  items sold in a week must be at most 6.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. It seems that you have weighted each of the possible number of items sold in a week equally. Remember that the average, or mean, of a distribution is a weighted sum of the possible outcomes, in which each weight is equal to the probability of the respective outcome occurring.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. We need to find the mean of X, μ<sub>x</sub>.  μ<sub>x</sub> = (0 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.20) + (2 * 0.40) + (3 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.05) + (5 * 0.05) + (6 * 0.05) = 2.2.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. The average of a distribution is generally not the same as the most likely outcome of that distribution. Remember that the average, or mean, of a distribution is a weighted sum of the possible outcomes, where each weight is equal to the probability of that outcome occurring.</feedback>

            <response match="E" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. The average of a distribution is generally not the same as 1/|S|, where S is the sample space and |S| represents the number of outcomes in the sample space. Remember that the average, or mean, of a distribution is a weighted sum of the possible outcomes where each weight is equal to the probability of that outcome occurring.</feedback>
