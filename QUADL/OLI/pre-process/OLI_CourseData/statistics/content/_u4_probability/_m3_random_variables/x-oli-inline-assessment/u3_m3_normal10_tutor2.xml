   <p>Recall that when appropriate, a binomial random variable can be approximated by a normal random variable that has the same mean and standard deviation as the binomial random variable. In other words, when appropriate, a binomial random variable with n trials and probability of success p, can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean 
      &#956; = np and standard deviation &#963; = sqrt( np (1 - p) ).   </p>   </content>

            <p>For example 1: X is binomial with n = 100 and p = .75, and would therefore be
                  approximated by a normal random variable having mean &#956; = 100 * 0.75 = 75 and
                  standard deviation &#963; = sqrt(100 * 0.75 * 0.25) = sqrt(18.75) = 4.33. Note
                  that if you look at the
                  histogram<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101122T135535-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                  this makes sense. The distribution is indeed centered at 75, and extends
                  approximately 3 standard deviations (3 * 4.33 = 13) on each side of the mean (as
                  we know normal distributions

                  <?oxy_insert_end?>.9, and would therefore be approximated by a normal random
                  variable having mean &#956; = 300 * 0.9 = 270 and standard deviation &#963; =
                  sqrt(300 * 0.9 * 0.1) = sqrt(27) = 5.2. Note that if you look at the
