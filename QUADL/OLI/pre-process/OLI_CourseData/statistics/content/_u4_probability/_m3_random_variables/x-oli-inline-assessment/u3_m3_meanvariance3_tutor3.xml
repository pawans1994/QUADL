            <p>The insurance company gets information about gas leakage in several houses that use
               the same gas provider that your customer does. In light of this new information, the
               probabilities of total loss and 50% damage (that were originally .002 and .008,
               respectively) are tripled (to .006 for total loss and .024 for 50% damage).
               Obviously, this change in the probabilities should be reflected in the annual
               premium, to account for the added risk that the insurance company is taking. What
               should be the new annual premium (instead of
               $1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150116-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>350),
               if the company wants to keep its expected gain of $750?</p>
            <p>Guidance: Let the new premium (instead of
               1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150229-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>350)
               be denoted by N, for new. Set up the new probability distribution of X using the
               updated probabilities, and using N instead of
               1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150240-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>350.
               (The answer to question 1 will help.)</p>
            <p>The question now is: What should
               <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150248-0500" content="be "?>the
               value of N (the new
               premium)<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150255-0500"?>
               be<?oxy_insert_end?>, if we want the mean of X
               <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150305-0500" content="still "?>to

               750?</p>
            
            <p>Set up an equation with N as unknown, and solve for N. </p>

               <p>Here is the new probability distribution of X:</p>

               <p>Note that we updated the probabilities of total loss and 50% damage by tripling
                  them, and the probability of no fire has changed to 1 - .006 - .024 = .97. The
                  company wants to keep the same annual gain from the policy ($750), and the
                  question
                  is<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150413-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                  what should
                  <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150416-0500" content="be "?>the
                  new premium

                  be<?oxy_insert_end?> that will satisfy this? In other words, we need to solve the
                  following equation for N:</p>
               <p>750 = (N -
                  100<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150450-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>000)(.006)
                  + (N -
                  50<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150452-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>000)(.024)
                  + N(.97)</p>
               <p>Thus, 750 = N - 600 -
                  1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150459-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>200<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150508-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                  or N -
                  1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150522-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>800.</p>
               <p>And therefore, N = 750 +
                  1<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150525-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>800

               <p>In order to account for the added risk that the insurance company is taking by
                  continuing to insure the
                  customer<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101121T150536-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
