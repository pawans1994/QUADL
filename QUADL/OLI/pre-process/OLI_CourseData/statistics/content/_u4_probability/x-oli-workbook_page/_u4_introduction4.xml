            <title>Determining Probability</title>
            <body>
                <p>There are 2 fundamental ways in which we can determine probability:</p>

                            (also known as
                            <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101105T152422-0400" comment="make bold to indicate new terminology"?>Observational<?oxy_comment_end?>)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Classical</em> methods are used for games of chance, such as flipping coins,
                    rolling dice, spinning spinners, roulette wheels, or lotteries.</p>
                <p>They are "classical" because their values are determined by the game itself. </p>
                <example>
                    <title>Flipping a Fair Coin</title>
                    <image src="../webcontent/coinflip.png" alt="hand flipping a coin"></image>
                    <!--  <flash src="../webcontent/flash/coin_flip.swf" width="100" height="110"/>-->
                    <p>A coin has two sides; we usually call them "heads" and "tails." For a "fair"
                        coin (one that is not unevenly weighted, and does not have identical images
                        on both sides) the chances that a "flip" will result in either side facing
                        up are equally likely. Thus, P(heads) = P(tails) = 1/2 or 0.5. Letting
                            <em>H</em> represent "heads," we can abbreviate the probability:
                            <em>P(H) = 0.5.</em></p>
                    <p>Classical probabilities can also be used for more realistic and useful
                        situations. A practical use of a coin flip would be for you and your
                        roommate to decide randomly who will go pick up the pizza you ordered for
                        dinner. A common expression is "Let's flip for it." This is because a coin
                        can be used to make a random choice with two options. Many sporting events
                        begin with a coin flip to determine which side of the field or court each
                        team will play on, or which team will have control of the ball first.</p>
                </example>
                <example>
                    <title>Rolling Fair Dice</title>
                    <image src="../webcontent/dice.png" alt="two die"></image>
                    <!-- <flash src="../webcontent/flash/dice_toss.swf" width="100" height="100"/>-->
                    <p>Each traditional (cube-shaped) die has six sides, marked in dots with the
                        numbers 1 through 6. On a "fair" die, these numbers are equally likely to
                        end up face-up when the die is rolled. Thus, P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = P(4) =
                        P(5) = P(6) = 1/6 or about 0.167.</p>
                    <p>Here, again, is a practical use of classical probability. Suppose six people
                        go out to dinner. You want to randomly decide who will pick up the check and
                        pay for everyone. Again, the P(each person) = 1/6.</p>
                </example>
                <example>
                    <title>Spinners</title>
                    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image_spinner3.gif"
                        alt="three color spinner, half blue, one-quarter red, one-quarter yellow"
                         height="75" width="75"/>
                    <p>This particular spinner has three colors, but each color is not equally
                        likely to be the result of a spin, since the portions are not the same
                        size.</p>
                    <p>Since the blue is half of the spinner, P(blue) = 1/2. The red and yellow make
                        up the other half of the spinner and are the same size. Thus, P(red) =
                        P(yellow) = 1/4.</p>
                    <p>Suppose there are 2 freshmen, 1 sophomore, and one junior in a study group.
                        You want to select one person. The P(F) = 2/4 = 1/2; P(S) = 1/4; and P(J) =
                        1/4, just like the spinner.</p>
                </example>
                <example>
                    <title>Selecting Students</title>
                    <p> Suppose we had three students and wished to select one of them randomly. To
                        do this you might have each person write his/her name on a (same-sized)
                        piece of paper, then put the three papers in a hat, and select one paper
                        from the hat without looking.</p>
                    <image src="../webcontent/image_spacer.gif" style="inline"/>
                    <image src="../webcontent/image_student1.jpg" alt="first student" width="113"
                        height="170" style="inline"/>
                    <image src="../webcontent/image_student2.jpg" alt="second student" width="113"
                        height="170" style="inline"/>
                    <image src="../webcontent/image_student3.jpg" alt="third student" width="113"
                        height="170" style="inline"/>
                    <p>Since we are selecting randomly, each is equally likely to be chosen. Thus,
                        each has a probability of 1/3 of being chosen.</p>
                    <p>A slightly more complicated, but more interesting, probability question would
                        be to propose selecting 2 of the students pictured above, and ask, "What is
                        the probability that the two students selected will be different
                        genders?"</p>
