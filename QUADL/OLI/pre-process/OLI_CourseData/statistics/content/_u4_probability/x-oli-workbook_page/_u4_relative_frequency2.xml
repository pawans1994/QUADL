        <p>So, we've seen how the relative frequency idea
            works<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101105T172858-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            and hopefully the activities have convinced you that the relative frequency of an event
            does indeed approach the theoretical probability of that event as the number of
            repetitions increases. This is called the <em>Law of Large Numbers</em>.</p>
        <p>The Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of trials
            increases<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101105T172914-0400"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            the relative frequency becomes the actual probability. So, using this law, as the number
            of trials increases, the empirical probability gets closer and closer to the theoretical
            probability.</p>
        <theorem type="principle">
            <statement>
                <p><em>Law of Large Numbers: </em>The actual (or true) probability of an event

                    is estimated by the relative frequency with which the event occurs in a long
                    series of trials.</p>

                <p><em>1.</em> Note that the relative frequency approach provides only an estimate
                    of the probability of an event. However, we can control how good this estimate
                    is by the number of times we repeat the random experiment. The more repetitions
                    that are performed, the closer the <em>relative frequency</em> gets to the
                        <em>true probability</em> of the event.</p>
                <p><em>2.</em> One interesting question would be: "How many times do I need to
                    repeat the random experiment in order for the relative frequency to be, say,
                    within .001 of the actual probability of the event?" We

                <p><em>3.</em> A pedagogical comment: We've introduced relative frequency here in a
                    more practical approach, as a method for estimating the probability of an event.
                    More traditionally, relative frequency is not presented as a method, but as a

                    physical circumstances do not make the probability obvious. In fact, most of the

                    and we must use empirical probabilities instead.</p>
