            <body><p>Describe what happened to the histogram as you flipped at least 1,000
                    times.</p></body>

                <explanation>After 1,000 flips, the total number of heads (1â€™s) should be
                    approximately half the total number of flips meaning P(H) will consistently stay
                    close to the classical probability of 0.5.</explanation>

                <explanation><p>Hopefully you noticed two things:</p>
                    <p>1. After 1,000&#8212;1,500 flips, P(H) will consistently stay close to the
                        classical probability of 0.5.</p>
                    <p>2.  In order to keep the width of the graph the same, the graph compressed.</p></explanation></part>
