            <feedback>Even though it is difficult to "let go" of your original choice, it turns out
               that this is not the best strategy to take. Read on for an explanation.</feedback>

            <feedback>Switching is indeed the best strategy. Can you figure out why this is the
               case? Read on for an explanation.</feedback>

         <response match="Res3" score="0">
            <feedback>This is the intuition of most people. There are two doors. One hides a prize
               behind it and one doesn't, so the chances of winning are the same (50%) with either
               selection. But actually, this is not the best strategy. Read on for an
               explanation.</feedback>
