            <body><p>What happened to P(H) as the number of flips increased from 100 to
                1,000?</p></body>

                <explanation><p>As the number of flips increased from 100 to over 1,000, the proportion of heads (1â€™s), or P(H), will consistently stay close to the preset
                        probability of 0.2. Since P(H) is not near 0.5, this is not a fair
                    coin.</p></explanation>

            <body><p>Flip the coin as many times as you need (at least several hundred) until you
                think you know what P(H) is. </p></body>

                <response input="A" match="*" score="1"/>
                <explanation><p>You should have gotten something close to 0.20. If you did not, you
                    probably did not flip the coin enough times. Try flipping at least 1,000
                    times.</p></explanation>
