            <body><p>Now that you have flipped the coin 30 times, what did you get for
                    P(H)?</p><p>To calculate P(H) take the total number of heads (the count of
                    the “1’s”) and divide by the total number of flips (30).</p></body>

                <explanation><p>Since this is a small number of tosses, even though the coin is fair
                        answers will vary and might be substantially different from
                    0.5.</p></explanation>

                <hint>Look at the cumulative proportion of "Heads" to find the number out of 30 that
                    were heads, along with that proportion represented in decimal form. </hint>
                <explanation><p>You should have gotten between 10 and 20 heads in your 30 flips.
                    This means that you would have gotten something between 0.32 and 0.68. </p>
                    <p> This could also be stated as: 0.32 ≤ P(H) ≤ 0.68.</p></explanation>
