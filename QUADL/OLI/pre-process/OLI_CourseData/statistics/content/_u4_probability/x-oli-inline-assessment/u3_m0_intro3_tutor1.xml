   <p>Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur. Choose the probability that best matches each of the following statements:</p>
   <p>(a) This event is impossible: <input_ref input="A"/></p>
   <p>(b) This event will occur more often than not, but is not extremely likely: <input_ref input="B"/></p>
   <p>(c) This event is extremely unlikely, but it will occur once in a while in a long sequence of trials: <input_ref input="C"/></p>
   <p>(d) This event will occur for sure: <input_ref input="D"/></p>
