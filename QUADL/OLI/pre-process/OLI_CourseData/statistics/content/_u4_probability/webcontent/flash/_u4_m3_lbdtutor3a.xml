In any case, the insurance company is gaining to the policy cost, which is $1350.* If there is total loss due to fire (which happens with probability .002), the insurance company has to pay the customer $100,000, and therefore the company's gain is: $1350-$100,000.* If there is 50% damage due to fire (which happens with probability .008), the insurance company has to pay the customer $50,000, and therefore the company's gain is: $1350-$100,000.* If there is no fire (which must happen with the "remaining probability" of 1-.002-.008=.99), the insurance company has to pay nothing and so is left with the premium gain of $1350.To summarize, the probability distribution of X is:</mattext><matimage label="" uri="../../../webcontent/flash/_u4_m3_lbdtutor3a_image1.jpg"/></material></solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
