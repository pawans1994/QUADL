            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Our answer:
* P(B|A)=P(B and A)/P(A)=.75/.90=.833 while P(B)=.8. Since the two are not equal, events A and B are not independent.
* P(A|B)=P(A and B)/P(B)=.75/.80= .9375 while P(A)=.9. Since the two are not equal, events A and B are not independent.
* P(B|A)=P(B and A)/P(A)=.75/.90=.833, while P(B|not A)=P(B and not A)/P(not A)=.05/.10=.50.  Since the two are not equal, events A and B are not independent.
* P(A and B)=.75 while P(A)*P(B)=.90*.80=.72. Since the two are not equal, events A and B are not independent.
Note that all four methods lead us to the same conclusions.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
