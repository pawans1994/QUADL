            <mattext texttype="text/plain">For example 1: X is binomial with n=100 and p=.75, and would therefore be approximated by a normal random variable having mean &#x03BC; = 100*0.75 = 75 and standard deviation &#x03C3; = sqrt(100*0.75*0.25) = sqrt(18.75) = 4.33.  Note that if you look at the histogram 3 above this makes sense. The distribution is indeed centered at 75, and extends approximately 3 standard deviations (3 * 4.33 =13) on each side of the mean (as we know normal distributions do)
For example 2: X is binomial with n=300 and p=.9, and would therefore be approximated by a normal random variable having mean &#x03BC; = 300*0.9 = 270 and standard deviation &#x03C3; = sqrt(300*0.9*0.1) = sqrt(27) = 5.2.  Note that if you look at the histogram 2 above this makes sense. The distribution is indeed centered at 270, and extends approximately 3 standard deviations (3 * 5.2 =15.6) on each side of the mean (as we know normal distributions do)</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
