            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Our answer: P(among the top three colors)=P(Silver or White or Black)

Since the three events: Silver, White and Black are disjoint (since a car can have just one color), we can apply the addition rule for disjoint events (extended to three disjoint events) and get:

P(among the top three colors) = P(Silver) + P(White) + P(Black) = 0.202 + 0.184 + 0.116 = 0.502.

In other words, 50.2% of cars manufactured in North America in 2003 were either silver, white, or black.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
