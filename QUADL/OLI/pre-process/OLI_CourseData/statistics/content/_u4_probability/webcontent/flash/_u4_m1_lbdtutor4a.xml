        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Consider the following two events:
     A - the middle child is a girl
     C - the three children are of the same gender. 
     
 In the box below answer the following:     
     i.  What are the possible outcomes that each of these events consist of? 
     ii. Do they share any of the outcomes? (i.e., is there an overlap between the two events?) 
     iii Based on ii, are the events disjoint or not?</mattext></material>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">i. Here are the possible outcomes in each of the two events:
       A={(BGB), (GGB), (BGG), (GGG)}
       C={(BBB), (GGG)}
 ii. The two events overlap, they have the outcome (GGG) in common.
 iii. Based on ii, the events are not disjoint since they can happen together, if the couple ends up having three girls.
