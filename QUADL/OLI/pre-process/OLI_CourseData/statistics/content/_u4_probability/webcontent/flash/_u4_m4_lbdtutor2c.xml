        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Find the approximate probability of at least 27 in 225 (proportion .12) being left-handed.  In other words, what is P(p-hat &#x2265; 0.12)?
&lt;b&gt;Guidance:&lt;/b&gt; Note that 0.12 is exactly 1 standard deviation (0.02) above the mean (0.1). Now use the Standard Deviation Rule</mattext></material>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Note that 0.12 is exactly 1 standard deviation above the mean.  The Standard Deviation Rule tells us that there is a 68% chance that the sample proportion falls within 1 standard deviation of its mean, that is between 0.08 and 0.12. There is therefore a probability of (1-0.68)/2 = 0.16 that the sample proportion falls above 0.12.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
