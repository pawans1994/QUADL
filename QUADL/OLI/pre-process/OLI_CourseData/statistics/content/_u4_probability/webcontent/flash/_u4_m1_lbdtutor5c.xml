            <mattext texttype="text/plain">If we WRONGLY apply the addition rule for disjoint events in order to find P(D1 or D2) we'll get:
   P(D1 or D2) = P(D1) + P(D2) = .86 + .54 = 1.4
The answer is wrong for certain(!) since we got a probability that is greater than 1. This proves the danger of incorrectly applying the addition rule for disjoint events when it is NOT appropriate to do so.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
