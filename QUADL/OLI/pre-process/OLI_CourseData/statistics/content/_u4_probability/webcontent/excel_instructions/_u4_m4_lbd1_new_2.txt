<ul><li>Under each column of data (say, in row 102), type the following formula: <code style="inline">=average(A1:A100)</code>, substituting of course the correct column letter for subsequent columns.  Note that the easiest way to do this is type the formula in one cell and then copy it to all the other cells, letting Excel change the column letters for you.</li><li>Now you should have a row with 250 sample proportions of your 250 samples.</li><li>Finally, ask Excel to make a histogram of these 250 values:</li><li> Click the <code style="inline">Data Analysis</code> button in the <code style="inline">Analysis</code> group on the <code style="inline">Data</code> tab.  Then choose <code style="inline">Histogram</code> in the resulting pop-up window and click <code style="inline">OK</code>.</li><li> In the next window, enter the range of sample proportions next to <code style="inline">Input Range</code>.  For example, if you calculated the sample proportions in row 102, you would enter <code style="inline">A102:IP102</code>.  If there is anything next to <code style="inline">Bin Range</code>, delete it (we will let Excel choose the bins for us).  Make sure that <code style="inline">Chart Output</code> is selected and click OK.</li><li>Excel will create a new worksheet with a histogram as well as a table with the underlying bins and frequency distribution.   The histogram is usually pretty small; you can click on it and then drag one of the handles on the outside to enlarge it.</li><li>Histograms shouldn't have spaces between the bars, so right-click on one of the bars and choose  <code style="inline">Format Data Series</code>.  Then set the gap width to 0% (No Gap).</li><li>Before closing the Format Data Series window, click on <code style="inline">Border Color</code> on the left, choose <code style="inline">Solid line</code>, and set the color to black.</li></ul>
