            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Now we can use the central limit theorem. Even though the population distribution is skewed to the right, the sample size is large enough to guarantee that the Central Limit Theorem works regardless of the population distribution.
According to the Central Limit Theorem, then, the mean has approximately a normal distribution with the same mean as the population, 54,000, and standard deviation </mattext>

<mattext texttype="text/plain">We find that while it is probably quite common to find teachers in this state with an annual salary that is less than 52,000, it would be extremely unusual for the mean salary of a sample of 64 teachers to be less than 52,000.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
