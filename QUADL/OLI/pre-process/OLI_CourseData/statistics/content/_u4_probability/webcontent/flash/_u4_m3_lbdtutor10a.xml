        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Males' height (X) follows (approximately) a normal distribution with mean of 69 inches and standard deviation 2.8.
Using Minitab find: 
(a) What proportion of males are less than 65 inches tall? (What is P(X &lt; 65)?)
(b) What proportion of males are more than 75 inches tall? (What is P(X &gt; 75)?)
(c) What proportion of males are between 66 and 72 inches tall? (What is &lt;br&gt;P(66 &lt; X &lt; 72)?)</mattext></material>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">(a) Minitab provides:
Normal with mean = 69 and standard deviation = 2.8
x           P(X &#x2264; x)
65        0.0765637&lt;br&gt;
So roughly 7.65% of males are less than 65 inches tall.
&lt;br&gt;(b) Minitab provides:
Normal with mean = 69 and standard deviation = 2.8&lt;br&gt;
x           P(X &#x2264; x)
75        0.983938&lt;br&gt;
P(X &gt; 75) = 1 − 0.983938 = 0.016062, and so roughly 1.6% of males are more than 75 inches tall.
(c) Minitab provides:&lt;br&gt;
Normal with mean = 69 and standard deviation = 2.8&lt;br&gt;
x           P(X &#x2264; x)
66        0.141988&lt;br&gt;
x           P(X &#x2264; x)
72        0.858012&lt;br&gt;
and therefore P(66 &lt; X &lt; 72) = 0.858012 − 0.141988 = 0.716024
Roughly 71.6% of males are between 66 and 72 inches tall.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
