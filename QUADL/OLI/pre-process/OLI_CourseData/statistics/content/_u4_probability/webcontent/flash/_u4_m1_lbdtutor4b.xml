        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Consider the following two events:
     A - exactly one of the three children is a girl
     C - exactly one of the three children is a boy.

In the box below answer the following:     
     i.  What are the possible outcomes that each of these events consist of? 
     ii. Do they share any of the outcomes? (i.e., is there an overlap between the two events?) 
     iii Based on ii, are the events disjoint or not?</mattext></material>

       A={(GBB), (BGB), (BBG)}
       C={(BGG), (GBG), (GGB)}
ii. The two events do not overlap, they have no outcome in common.
iii. Based on ii, the events are disjoint - they can never occur together.
