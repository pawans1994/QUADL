What is the probability that this is the only sale that the salesperson will make within the first hour?  This is a bit tricky....Let's rephrase the question in a way that it will be easier to translate it to the language of probability. We are given that one sale has been made 10 minutes into the hour - this means that the number of sales that will be made within the hour, X, is at least one. In other words, we are given that X is greater than or equal to 1.   Given that information, we are asked to find what is the probability that this will be the only sale, i.e., that X=1.  Putting this together....the question asks you to find: P(X=1 | X &#x2265; 1).</mattext></material>          <response_str ident="Short answer 1">            <render_fib fibtype="String" prompt="Box">              <response_label ident="Res 1"/></render_fib></response_str></presentation>        <resprocessing>          <outcomes/>          <respcondition>            <conditionvar>              <other/></conditionvar>            <displayfeedback linkrefid="Feedback always"/></respcondition></resprocessing>        <itemfeedback ident="solution">          <solution>          <solutionmaterial>          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">We use the conditional probabilities definition P(B|A)=P(A and B)/P(A) to solve: </mattext>            <matimage label="" uri="../../../webcontent/flash/_u4_m3_lbdtutor2b_image1.jpg"/>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">(Note that we are treating "X=1" as event B and "X &#x2265; 1" as event A).
