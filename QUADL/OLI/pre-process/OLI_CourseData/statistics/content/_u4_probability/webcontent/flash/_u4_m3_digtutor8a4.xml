This random experiment consists of 1000 trials (1000 males), all having the same probability of being color blind ("success"), and X counts how many of the trials (subjects) ended up in a "success" (are color blind). Note that even though the selection here is without replacement, we can disregard the dependence problem, and regard the trials as independent, since the population (all males) is more than 10 times the sample size (10,000).	</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack1">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect.
