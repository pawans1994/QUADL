Let's see why X is not binomial. The random experiment consists of 6 trials (6 family members), where the outcome of interest (success) is having blue eyes. Even though X counts the number of "successes" among the 6 "trials", X is not binomial since eye color is hereditary, and therefore the 6 trials are not independent. Knowing, for example, that the father has blue eyes has an impact on the probability that the children have blue eyes.	</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack1">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Good Job.
