Note that you are sampling without replacement. 5 subjects out of 30, and therefore the 5 "trials" (selections), are not independent. Whether the first selected person is a male or a female has an impact on the second person being a female. Recall that the rule of thumb says, when you are sampling without replacement, you can ignore the dependence problem, as long as the population is at least 10 times as large as the sample size. In this case, the "population" consists of the 30 people in the party, and 5 of them were selected. 30 is less than 10*5, and therefore the rule of thumb is not satisfied.	</mattext></material></itemfeedback>        <itemfeedback ident="FeedBack1">          <material>            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Good Job!
