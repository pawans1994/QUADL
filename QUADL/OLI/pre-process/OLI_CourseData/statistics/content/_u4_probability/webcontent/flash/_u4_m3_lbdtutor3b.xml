Since the insurance company probably sells a lot of policies of this type, in the majority of them (99%) the company will gain money ($1350), and in the remaining 1% of the time, it will lose (either 1350-100000 or 1350-50000). Averaging over all such policies, the company is going to make about 750$ from each such fire insurance policy.			</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
