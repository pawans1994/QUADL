        <mattext texttype="text/plain">How many of your 10 samples had at least two people with the same birthday (i.e., how many yes's)?  What is the relative frequency of samples that had at least two people with the same birthday? (this is your estimated probability of at least one birthday match in a group of 30 people)</mattext></material></presentation>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Since this is a simulation exercise, different students might get different answers. The TRUE probability is about .70, so hopefully your estimated probability is around this number. Note that since we used only 10 repetitions, we cannot expect our estimated probability to be too close to the true answer, but just a rough approximation.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
