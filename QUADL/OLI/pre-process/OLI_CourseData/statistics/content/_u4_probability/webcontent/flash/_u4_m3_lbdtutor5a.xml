            <mattext texttype="text/plain">The cost to university for offering this course is 8000+45X: $8000 to the instructor, and $45 for each registered student, the number of which is expressed by the random variable X.  Note that the cost is an expression of the type a+bx, where a=8000 and b=45.  The first set of rules for means and variances tells us that: 
the mean of (a+bX) = a + b * (the mean of X)
the variance of (a+bX) = b squared * the variance of X</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
