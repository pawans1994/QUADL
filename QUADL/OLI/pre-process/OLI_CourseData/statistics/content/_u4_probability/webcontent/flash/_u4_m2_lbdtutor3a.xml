            <mattext texttype="text/plain">We are given the following:
• There is a 3% chance that the engine is overheating → P(H) = 0.03
• The probability of the warning light showing up when it should is 0.98. Another way to say this is, given that the engine is overheating, the probability of getting a warning light is 0.98. This, therefore, translates to P(W|H) = 0.98
• 1% of the time the warning light appears for no apparent reason. Another way to say this is: Given that the engine is not overheating, the probability of getting the warning light is 0.01. This, therefore, translates to P(W|not H ) = 0.01.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
