            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Since this is a simulation, everyone will get a slightly different histogram, but the following general features should be the same.
* The distribution is centered around 0.6. We thought that that would be the case, since the samples were chosen from a population with population proportion of 0.6, so we expect the samples to produce a sample proprotion close to that (some below, some above).
* The shape of the distribution is definitely very close to normal, where most of the sample proportions are in the middle (close to 0.6) and sample proportions far from 0.6 in either direction would be progressively less likely. We expected to see this.
* The distribution ranges from about 0.45 to 0.75 on the other side. Since we know that there are about 3 standard deviations on either side of the mean in a normal distribution, we can estimate that the standard deviation is about (0.75-0.6)/3 = 0.05 (same on the other side).</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
