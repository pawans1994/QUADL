        <mattext texttype="text/plain">When a driver notices that the warning light is on, how worried does he/she need to be? In other words, given that the warning light is on, how likely is it that the engine is really overheating? Use the definition of conditional probability, and the information you obtained in the previous question to find P(H|W).</mattext></material>

          <material>
            <mattext texttype="text/plain">By the definition of conditional probability, P(H|W)=P(H and W)/P(W).
In the first question we found that P(H and W)=.0294, and that P(W)=.0391.
Therefore: P(H|W)=.0294/.0391=.752
This means that when the warning light is on, there is about a 75% chance that the engine is indeed overheating, and therefore it is advisable for the driver to stop the car and let the engine cool down.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
