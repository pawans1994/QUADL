        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Good Job! Indeed, the probability distribution of Y has most of the weight (80%) on the larger values (3,4), while the distribution of X has most of the "weight" (70%) on the smaller values (0,1,2). Since the mean is a weighted average of the values weighted by their probabilities, we would expect the mean of Y to be larger than the mean of X which is 1.8</mattext></material></itemfeedback>

        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Incorrect. Note that the probability distribution of Y has most of the weight (80%) on the larger values (3,4), while the distribution of X has most of the "weight" (70%) on the smaller values (0,1,2). Recall the the mean of a random variable is a weighted average of it's values weighted by the corresponding probabilities, and try again.</mattext></material></itemfeedback>
