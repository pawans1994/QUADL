Setting the flags so that there is a probability of .8 between them (or the closest we can get to .5 using the applet which is .7994) we see that the deciles of any normal distribution lie approximately 1.28 standard deviation below and above the mean.</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
