<ul><li>Under each column of data (say, in row 102), type the following formula: <code style="inline">=average(A1:A100)</code>, substituting of course the correct column letter for subsequent columns.  Note that the easiest way to do this is type the formula in one cell and then copy it to all the other cells, letting Excel change the column letters for you.</li><li>Now you should have a row with 250 sample proportions of your 250 samples.</li><li>Finally, ask Excel to make a histogram of these 250 values:</li><li>Choose Tools -&gt; Data Analysis from the menubar.  In the pop-up window, choose <code style="inline">Histogram</code>.</li><li>In the next window, enter the range of sample proportions next to <code style="inline">Input Range</code>.  For example, if you calculated the sample proportions in row 102, you would enter <code style="inline">A102:IP102</code>.  If there is anything next to <code style="inline">Bin Range</code>, delete it (we will let Excel choose the bins for us).  Make sure that <code style="inline">Chart Output</code> is selected and click OK.</li><li>Excel will create a new worksheet with a histogram as well as a table with the underlying bins and frequency distribution.  You can click and drag the lower right hand corner of the graph to enlarge it.</li><li>Finally, if you want to get rid of the spaces that Excel leaves between the bars, you can right-click on any of the bars and choose <code style="inline">Format Data Series</code>.  In the pop-up window, click on the <code style="inline">Options</code> tab and change the Gap width to 0.</li></ul>
