            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Let C be the event that the person is pro-choice.  Let D be the event that the person is in favor of the death penalty.  We need to find P(C and D).

In this case it would be inappropriate to use the multiplication rule since C and D are not independent.

It is reasonable to argue that a liberal person who is pro-choice would be less likely to be in favor of the death penalty, while a conservative person who is pro-life would be more likely to be in favor of the death penalty. In other words, whether C occurs or not, affects the probability that D occurs, and thus C and D are not independent, and using our multiplication rule is inappropriate.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
