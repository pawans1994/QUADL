            <mattext texttype="text/plain">We are given that that document was delivered on time using service A, and we are wondering how likely is it that it will not be delivered on time using service B. We are therefore looking for P(not B|A).  Using the definition of conditional probability and the probability table, we get that:
P(not B|A)=P(A and not B)/P(A)=.15/.90=.167 
  
Let's summarize the results we got:
P(B|A)=.833
P(B|not A)=.50
P(not B|A)=.167.

Note that P(B|A)=1-P(not B|A), which tells us that P(not B|A) is the complement event of P(B|A).  Students sometimes tend to get confused and think that the complement event of P(B|A) is P(B|not A).  Please pay attention to that. The complement rule extends to conditional probabilities only when you condition on the same event!</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
