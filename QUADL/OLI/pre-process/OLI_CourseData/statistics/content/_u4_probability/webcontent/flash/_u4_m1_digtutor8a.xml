            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Let L1 be the event that the first person is pro-life, and let L2 be the event that the second person is pro-life.

We need to find P(L1 and L2). Since the two were chosen at random, L1 and L2 are independent and we may use the multiplication rule for independent events:

P(L1 and L2)=P(L1)*P(L2)= .47*.47=.2209.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
