            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Since the scores on the SAT-M in the population follow a normal distribution, the sample mean automatically also follows a  normal distribution, for any sample size (see comment 4). Therefore, the mean has a normal distribution with the same mean as the population, 507, and standard deviation </mattext>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">We find that while it is very common to find students who score above 600 on the SAT-M,  it would be quite unlikely (4.65% chance) for the mean score of a sample of 4 students to be above 600. </mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
