        <mattext texttype="text/plain">If the document has reached its destination on time using service A, what is the probability that it will also reach it's destination by service B?  When you answer, first write down the conditional probability we are looking for, and then find it using the definition of conditional probability: P(B|A)=P(A and B)/P(A).</mattext></material>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">We are given that the document has arrived on time using service A, and we are wondering what the probability is that it will also arrive on time using service B. We are therefore looking for P(B|A).
Using the definition of conditional probability and the probability table, we get that: P(B|A)=P(A and B)/P(A)=.75/.9=.833</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
