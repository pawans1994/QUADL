        <mattext texttype="text/plain">Recall that males' height follows a normal distribution with mean 69 inches and standard deviation 2.8 inches.
Using R, answer the following:
(a) How tall must a male be, in order to be among the shortest 0.5% of males?
(b) How tall must a male be, in order to be among the tallest  0.25% of males?</mattext></material>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">(a) Here we need to find the value x that satisfies P(X &lt; x) = 0.005. R provides:&lt;br&gt;
&gt; qnorm(0.005, mean=69, sd=2.8)
[1] 61.78768&lt;br&gt;
So, in order for a male to be among the shortest 0.5% of males, he needs to be less than 61.8 inches tall.&lt;br&gt;
(b) Here we need to find the value x that satisfies P(X &gt; x) = 0.0025, or P(X &lt; x) = 0.9975.  R provides:&lt;br&gt;
&gt; qnorm(0.9975, mean=69, sd=2.8)
[1] 76.8597&lt;br&gt;
So, in order for a male to be among the tallest 0.25% of males, he needs to be more than 76.9 inches tall.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
