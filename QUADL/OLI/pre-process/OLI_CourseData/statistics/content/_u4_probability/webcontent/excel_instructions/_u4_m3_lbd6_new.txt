To find probabilities of the type P(X=k) or P(X&lt;=k) in Excel, we'll use the following function: <code style="inline">=BINOMDIST(k, n, p, cumulative)</code> where:<ul><li>k is the number of successes in trials</li><li>n is the number of independent trials</li><li>p is the probability of success on each trial</li><li>cumulative is a logical value that determines the form of the function.  If cumulative is TRUE, then BINOMDIST returns the cumulative distribution function, which is the probability that there are at most k successes: P(X&lt;=k).  If FALSE, it returns the probability mass function, which is the probability that there are exactly k successes: P(X=k).</li></ul>
