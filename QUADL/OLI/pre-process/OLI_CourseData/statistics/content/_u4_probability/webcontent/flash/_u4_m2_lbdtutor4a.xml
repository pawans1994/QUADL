Either the engine is overheated and the warning light is on, or the engine is not overheated and the warning light is on)</mattext></material>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">The two possibilities that we need to consider here are:
P(W) = P(H and W) + P(not H and W) = 0.03*0.98 + 0.97*0.01 = 0.0294 + 0.0097= 0.0391
