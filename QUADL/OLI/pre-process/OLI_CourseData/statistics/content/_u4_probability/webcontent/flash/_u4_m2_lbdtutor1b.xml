        <mattext texttype="text/plain">If service A has failed to deliver the document on time, what is the probability that it will be on time using service B? (Again, as before, first write down the conditional probability that you are asked to find, and then apply the definition of conditional probability to find it.)</mattext></material>

            <mattext texttype="text/plain">We are given that that document was not delivered on time using service A (not A), and we are wondering how likely is it that it will be delivered on time using service B. We are therefore looking for P(B|not A).
Using the definition of conditional probability and the probability table, we get that: P(B|not A)=P(not A and B)/P(not A)=.05/.1=.50</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
