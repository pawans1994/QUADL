The company wants to keep the same annual gain from the policy ($750), and question is what should be the new premium N that will satisfy this. In other words, we need to solve the following equation for N: 750=(N-100000)*.006+(N-50000)*.024+N*.97=N-600-1200=N-1800. And therefore, N=750+1800=2550In order to account for the added risk that the insurance company is taking by continuing to insure the customer the premium changes from 1350 to 2550.</mattext></material>          </solutionmaterial>          </solution></itemfeedback></item>
