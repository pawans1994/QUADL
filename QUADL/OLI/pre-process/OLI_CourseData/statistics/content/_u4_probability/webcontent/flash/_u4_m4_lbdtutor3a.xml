            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Since this is a simulation, everyone will get a slightly different histogram, but the following general features should be the same. 
* The distribution is centered around 3.5. We thought that that would be the case, since the samples were chosen from a "population" whose mean is 3.5 ,so we expect the samples to produce a sample averages around that (some below, some above). 
* The shape of the distribution is somewhat normal in the sense that most of the averages are close to 3.5, and then averages far from 3.5 in either direction are progressively less likely. We expected to see this. 
* The distribution ranges from 1 to 6.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
