            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Since the Standard Deviation Rule applies the probability is approximately .997 that the sample proportion falls within 3 standard deviations of its mean, that is, between .1-3(.02) and .1+3(.02).  There is roughly a 99.7% chance, therefore that the sample proportion falls in the interval (.04, .16).</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
