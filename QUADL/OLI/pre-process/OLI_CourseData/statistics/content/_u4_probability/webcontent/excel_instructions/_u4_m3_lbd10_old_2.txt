<ul><li>To do this in Excel, we can use a table similar to the one we created above, but this time we're looking for: <code style="inline">z-score</code> and <code style="inline">X</code>  Basically, we're going to do the inverse of the procedure we described above.</li><li>This time, we're given the population mean and standard deviation, but instead of being given an X and asked to find the probability, we're given a probability and asked to find the corresponding X value.</li><li>To calculate the z-score given a probability, we'll use another Excel function called <code style="inline">NORMSINV</code>, that takes a probability and uses it to calculate a z-score.  This function is the inverse of the <code style="inline">NORMSDIST</code> function that we used previously, and takes the place of us having to look up the z-score in a normal table.  The formula we'll use is <code style="inline">=NORMSINV(0.98)</code>.  Excel tells us that the z-score is 2.053748.</li><li>To calculate the X value that corresponds to that z-score, we'll again use the equation z = (X - mean)/stdev.  In this case, we get X = 2.053748 * 111 + 507, or 734.966.</li></ul>
