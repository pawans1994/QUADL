            <mattext texttype="text/plain">Recall from the EDA section that salary distribution is typically skewed to the right.  Since 5 is a small sample size, and the Central Limit Theorem does not guarantee that the sample mean coming from a skewed population is approximately normal unless the sample size is larger. Thus, we do not have enought information to solve the problem.</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
