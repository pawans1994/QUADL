It is impossible for two events to be disjoint and independent. If they are disjoint, they MUST be dependent! Let me try to explain why.  If two events A and B are disjoint, then by definition they cannot both occur. In other words, if we know that A, say, occured than we know for certain that B cannot occur (since they are disjoint) which means that P(B)=0.  We therefore see that if two events are disjoint, knowing that one event occurs changes the probability that the other occurs to 0. This means that the two events are dependent!</mattext></material></solutionmaterial></solution></itemfeedback></item></questestinterop>
