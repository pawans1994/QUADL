<p>Now that we have an understanding of conditional probabilities and can express them with concise
            notation, and have a more formal understanding of what it means for two events to be
            independent, we can finally establish the General Multiplication Rule, a formal rule for
            finding P(A and B)
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T141347-0500"?>that<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T141345-0500" content="which"?>
            applies to any two events, whether they are independent or dependent.</p>
<p>We begin with an example that contrasts P(A and B) for
            <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T141407-0500" content="the "?>independent
            and
            <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T141413-0500" content="the "?>dependent
            case<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T141418-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>.</p>
<example>

<p>Suppose you pick two cards at random from four cards consisting of one of each suit: club,
                diamond, heart, and spade, where the first card is replaced before the second card
                is picked. What is the probability of picking a club and then a diamond? Because the
                sampling is done with replacement, whether or not a diamond is picked on the second
                selection is independent of whether or not a club has been picked on the first
                selection. Rule 5, the multiplication rule for independent events, tells us
                that<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T141447-0500"?>:<?oxy_insert_end?>
            </p>
<p>P(C1 and D2) = P(C1) * P(D2) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. </p>
<p>[Here we denote the event
                "club<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T141504-0500" content="s"?>
                picked on first selection" as C1 and the event
                "diamond<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T141507-0500" content="s"?>
                picked on second selection" as D2.] The display below shows that 1/4 of the time
                we'll pick a club first, and of these times, 1/4 will result in a diamond on the
                second pick: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 of the selections will have a club first and then a
                diamond.</p>

<example>

<p>Suppose you pick two cards at random from four cards consisting of one of each suit: club,
                diamond, heart, and spade, without replacing the first card before the second card
                is picked. What is the probability of picking a club and then a diamond? The
                probability in this case is not 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16; because the sampling is done
                without replacement,
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T141630-0500"?>so
                <?oxy_insert_end?>whether or not a diamond is picked on the second selection
                    <em>does</em> depend on what was picked on the first selection.

                As in the example above, 1/4 of the time we'll pick a club first. But since the club
                has been removed, 1/3 of these selections with a club first will have a diamond
                second. The probability of a club and then a diamond is 1/4*1/3=1/12; this is the
                probability of getting a club first, multiplied by the probability of getting a
                diamond second, given that a club was picked first. Using the notation of
                conditional probabilities, we can write</p>
<p>P(C1 and D2) = P(C1) * P(D2 | C1) = 1/4 * 1/3 = 1/12.</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image008.gif" alt="All of the suit possibilities of picking

        CD, CH, CS. Note that 1/4 of these have C picked first (the last 3, out of 12 total). Out of

</example>
<p>For independent events A and B, we had the rule P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Due to independence, to
            find the probability of both, we could multiply the probability of A by the simple
            probability of B, because the occurrence of A would have no effect on the probability of
            B occurring. Now, for events A and B that may be dependent, to find the probability of
            both, we multiply the probability of A by the conditional probability of B, taking into
            account that A has occurred. Thus, our general multiplication rule is stated as
