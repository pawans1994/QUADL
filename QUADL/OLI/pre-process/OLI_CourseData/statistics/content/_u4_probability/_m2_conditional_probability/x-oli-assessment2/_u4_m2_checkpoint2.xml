            <p>Dogs are inbred for such desirable characteristics as blue eye color, but an unfortunate
                by-product of such inbreeding can be the emergence of characteristics such as
                deafness. A 1992 study of Dalmatians (by Strain and others, as reported in <em

                <p>Two methods, A and B, are available for teaching a certain industrial skill.
                    There is an 80% chance of successfully learning the skill if method A is used,
