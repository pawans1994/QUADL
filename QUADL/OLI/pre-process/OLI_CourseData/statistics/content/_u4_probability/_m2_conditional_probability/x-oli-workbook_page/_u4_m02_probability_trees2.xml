<p>Now that we understand how to construct the probability tree, let's use the tree to answer some questions:</p>
<example>

<p>What is the overall probability that the sales rep
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T160652-0500"?>will
                <?oxy_insert_end?>take<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T160655-0500" content="s"?>
                the Bermuda vacation?</p>
<p>Notice that a V branch can be reached by either a C or a not C branch: either the sales rep gets the commission and takes the vacation, or he does not get the commission and he takes the vacation. Symbolically, V = (C and V) or (not C and V). Thus, the overall probability of taking the vacation is</p>
<p> P(V) = P( (C and V) or (not C and V) ). </p>
<p>Applying the
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T160732-0500"?>A<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T160731-0500" content="a"?>ddition

                to each term, we have</p>
<p> P(V) = P(C) * P(V | C) + P(not C) * P(V | not C) = .4<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T160822-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>*<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T160823-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>.9 + .6<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T160824-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>*<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T160825-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>.3 = .36 + .18 = .54.</p>
<p>The overall probability that the sales rep will take the Bermuda vacation is .54. The tree diagram below shows the probabilities obtained via the general multiplication rule, and then the addition rule.</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image011.gif" alt="A probability tree. We will be naming paths
through the tree with the notation &quot;{first branch-off: probability of branch-off; second branch-off:
probability of branch-off; ...}&quot;. Each branch-off represents the path we take when we need to take a
branch, and the probability for taking that branch is provided.
    {C: .4; V: .9};
    {C: .4; not V: .1};
    {not C: .6; V: .3};
    {not C: .6; not V: .7};
    
Now, focus on the {C: .4, V: .9} branch. From this branch we can conclude that P(C and V) = P(C) * P(V|C) =
.4 * .9 = .36 . Also, the other branch {not C: .6, V: .3} branch shows that P(not C and V) = P(not C) *
P(V | not C) = .6 * .3 = .18 . From these two, we can obtain P(V) = P(C and V) + P(not C and V) = .36 + .18
= .54 ."/>

<p>Following one branch to a connected branch, such as C then V, represents the occurrence of one event and then another, which requires multiplication of probabilities.  Including outcomes reached via either of two end-branches represents the occurrence of one event or another, which requires addition of probabilities.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate the background situation of either getting the commission or

                    with the follow-up circumstance of either taking the vacation or not, we can
                    draw a different sort of Venn diagram:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image012.gif" alt="The entire sample space is represented by a large
rectangle. This rectangle is divided into two pieces. One side is for C and the other side is for not C. In the
middle of the rectangle is a circle, which has one part in C and the other in not C. The circle represents V, and
the part of the circle in C represents C and V, and the other part (in not C) represents not C and V."/>
<p>The diagram shows that V = (C and V) or (not C and V), where (C and V) and (not C and V) are
                    disjoint. Applying first the

                    for Disjoint Events<?oxy_insert_end?> and then the
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T161128-0500"?>G<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T161128-0500" content="g"?>eneral

                    we have P(V) = P(C and V) + P(not C and V) = P(C) * P(V | C) + P(not C) * P(V |
                    not C), just as we saw in our tree diagram.</p>
<p>We can generalize our solution to obtain an expression for the probability of any event B, based on how B is impacted by the occurrence or non-occurrence of some other event A. We call this the <em>Law of Total Probability: </em>P(B) = P(A) * P(B | A) + P(not A) * P(B | not A).</p>

<example>

<p>Suppose the friend finds out that the sales rep has left for Bermuda. Is it likely that the
                commission came through? Find the probability that the commission came through,
                given that <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T161311-0500"?>the
                sales
                rep<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T161310-0500" content="he"?>
                went to Bermuda.</p>
<p>Here, we are asked to find the probability that the commission came through, given that the sales rep took his Bermuda vacation, P(C | V). Using the definition of conditional probability,</p>
<p> P(C | V) = P(C and V) / P(V)</p>
<p>and now, using the tree, and our result from part (a) (P(V) = .54)), we get that:</p>
<p> P(C | V) = P(C and V) / P(V) = .36/.54 = .67</p>
<p>Thus, if it is known that the sales rep left for the Bermuda vacation, it is more likely than not that the commission came through.</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image013.gif" alt="A probability tree. We will be naming paths
through the tree with the notation &quot;{first branch-off: probability of branch-off; second branch-off:
probability of branch-off; ...}&quot;. Each branch-off represents the path we take when we need to take a
branch, and the probability for taking that branch is provided.
    {C: .4; V: .9};
    {C: .4; not V: .1};
    {not C: .6; V: .3};
    {not C: .6; not V: .7};

From this tree, we observe that the branch {C: .4, V: .9} represents P(C and V) = P(C) and P(V|C) = 
.4 * .9 = .36. We also observe that the branch {not C: .6, V: .3} represents P(not C and V) = 
P(not C) and P(V|not C) = .6 * .3 = .18 . From these two we calculate P(V) = P(C and V) or P(not C
and V) = .36 + .18 = .54. We also know that P(C|V) = P(C and V)/P(V) = .36/.54 = .67, giving us our
answer."/>

<p>Ordinarily, when events occur in stages, the explanatory variable would be the occurrence or
                    non-occurrence of a certain event at the first stage, and the response
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T161428-0500"?>variable
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>would be the occurrence or non-occurrence of the next event
                    chronologically. In such
                    cases<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T161435-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    we would identify the probability of a certain response, given that the
                    explanatory variable took a certain value. However, there are sometimes
                    situations, as in the second example above, where what we know is the ultimate
                    outcome, and what we want to find
                    <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T161450-0500"?>out
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>is the probability that a certain event occurred previously.
                    Our solution to that example suggests a general formula for solving problems of
                    this form:</p>
