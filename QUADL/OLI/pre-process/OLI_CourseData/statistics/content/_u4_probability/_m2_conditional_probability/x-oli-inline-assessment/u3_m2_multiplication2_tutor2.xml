         <p>Express all the information that is given in the problem in terms of probabilities involving the events H and W (note that some of the information involves conditional probabilities).</p>

            <p>We are given the following:</p>
            
            <p>&#8226; There is a 3% chance that the engine is overheating, therefore P(H) = 0.03.</p>
            <p>&#8226; The probability of the warning light showing up when it should is 0.98. Another way to say this is, Given that the engine is overheating, the probability of getting a warning light is 0.98. This, therefore, translates to  P(W | H) = 0.98.</p>
            <p>&#8226; 1% of the time, the warning light appears for no apparent reason. Another way
                  to say this is, Given that the engine is not overheating, the probability of
                  getting the warning light is 0.01. This, therefore, translates to P(W | not H) =
                  0.01.</p>
