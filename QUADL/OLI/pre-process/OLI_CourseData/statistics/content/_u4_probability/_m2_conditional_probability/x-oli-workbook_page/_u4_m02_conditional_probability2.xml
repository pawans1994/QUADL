            of this conditional probability is provided by the two-way table:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image002.gif" alt="The same table of the data for piercings.
The column headings are &quot;Pierced,&quot; &quot;Not Pierced,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; The
Rows are &quot;Male,&quot; &quot;Female,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; The data in the cells is
given in &quot;Row, Column:
    Value&quot; format:
    Male, Pierced: 36;
    Male, Not Pierced: 144;

    In this table, the first row (Male) has been highlighted. The {Male, Pierced: 36} cell is
in dark green, and the rest is in light green, showing that we can use this row to calculate
the conditional probability.

            <p> Consider the piercing example, where the following two-way table is given,</p>
            <image src="../webcontent/dig001.gif" alt="The same table of the data for piercings.
The column headings are &quot;Pierced,&quot; &quot;Not Pierced,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; The
Rows are &quot;Male,&quot; &quot;Female,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; The data in the cells is
given in &quot;Row, Column:

        Total, Total: 500;"/>
            <p>Recall also that M represents the event of being a male
                    (<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T101841-0500"?>"<?oxy_insert_end?>not

                    represents being a female), and E represents the event of having one or both

<p>Another way to visualize conditional probability is
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T103225-0500"?>using<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T103223-0500" content="by"?>
            a Venn diagram:</p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image003.gif" alt="A Venn Diagram, in which a large rectangle
represents all of the sample space. There are two circles in the rectangle, labeled M (for Male) and E
(for Ear Pierced). Circle M and circle E overlap (but not totally). P(M) = 180/500 = .36, so this is
somewhat like the area of circle M. The overlap is the event M and E. P(M and E) = 36/500 = .072, which
is also like the area of the overlap area."/>
<p>In both the two-way table and the Venn diagram, the reduced sample space (comprised of only males) is shaded light green, and within this sample space, the event of interest (having ears pierced) is shaded darker green. The two-way table illustrates the idea via counts, while the Venn diagram converts the counts to probabilities, which are presented as regions rather than cells.</p>
<p>We may work with counts, as presented in the two-way table, to write</p>
<p>P(E | M) = 36/180. </p>
<p>Or we can work with probabilities, as presented in the Venn diagram, by writing</p>
<p>P(E | M) = (36/500) / (180/500). </p>
<p>We will want, however, to write our formal expression for conditional probabilities in terms of other, ordinary, probabilities and therefore the definition of conditional probability will grow out of the Venn diagram.</p>
<p>Notice that</p>
<p>P(E | M) = (36/500) / (180/500) = P(M and E) / P(M). Generalized, we have a formal definition of conditional probability:</p>

<p>1. Note that when we evaluate the conditional probability, we always divide by the probability of the given event. The probability of both goes in the numerator. </p>
<p>2. The above formula holds as long as P(A) &gt;
                    0<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T103526-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    since we cannot divide by 0. In other words, we should not seek the probability
                    of an event given that an impossible event has occurred.</p>
<p>Let's see how we can use this formula in practice:</p>
</body>
</section>
<example>

<p>On the "Information for the Patient" label of a certain
                anti<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T103607-0500" content="-"?>depressant<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T103605-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                it is claimed that based on some clinical trials, there is a 14% chance of
                experiencing sleeping problems known as insomnia (denote this event by I), there is
                a 26% chance of experiencing headache (denote this event by<?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T103707-0500" comment="remove bold -- no emphasis needed"?>
                <em>H</em>), and there is a 5% chance of experiencing both side effects (<em>I and
                    H</em>)<?oxy_comment_end?>.</p>
<p>(a) Suppose that the patient experiences insomnia; what is the probability that the patient will also experience headache?</p>
<p> Since we know (or it is given) that the patient experienced insomnia, we are looking for P(H<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T103723-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>|<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T103723-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>I). According to the definition of conditional probability:</p>
<p> P(H | I) = P(H and I) / P(I) = .05/.14 = .357.</p>
<p>(b) Suppose the drug induces headache in a patient; what is the probability that it also induces insomnia? </p>
<p> Here, we are given that the patient experienced headache, so we are looking for P(I | H). </p>
<p> Using the definition P(I | H) = P(I and H) / P(H) = .05/.26 = .1923.</p>
</example>

<p>Note that the answers to (a) and (b) above are

                    In general, P(A | B) does not equal P(B | A). We'll come back and illustrate
                    this point later in this module.</p>
