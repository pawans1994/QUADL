               o<?oxy_comment_end?>n time using service B? (Again, as before, first write down the
               conditional probability that you are asked to find, and then apply the definition of
               conditional probability to find it.)</p>

            <p>We are given that the document was not delivered on time using service A (not A), and
                  we are wondering how likely is it that it
                  <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T104953-0500"?>was<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T104952-0500" content="will be"?>
                  delivered on time using service B. We are therefore looking for P(B | not A).</p>
            <p>Using the definition of conditional probability and the probability table, we get
               that:</p>
            <p>P(B | not A) = P(not A and B) / P(not A) = .05/.1 = .50</p>
