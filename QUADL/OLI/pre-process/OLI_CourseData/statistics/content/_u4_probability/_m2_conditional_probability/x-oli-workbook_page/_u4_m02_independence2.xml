<p>Recall the pierced ears example. We checked the independence of the events M (being a male) and E
                    (having pierced ears) by comparing P(E) to P(E<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T115641-0500"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>|<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T115641-0500"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>M).</p>
<p>An alternative method of checking for dependence would be to compare P(E | M) with P(E | not M) [same as P(E | F)].  In our case, P(E | M) = 36/180 = .2, while P(E | not M) = 288/320 = .9, and since the two are very different, we can say that the events E and M are not independent.</p>
<p>In general, another method for checking the independence of events A and B is to compare <em>P(B
                        | A) and P(B | not A)</em>. In other words, two events are independent if
                    the probability of one event does not change whether we know that the other
                    event has occurred or we know that the other event

                    It can be shown that <em>P(B | A) and P(B | not
                    A)</em><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T120402-0500" content="."?>
                    would differ whenever P(B) and P(B | A) differ, so this is another perfectly
                    legitimate way to establish dependence or independence.</p>

<p>Before we establish a general rule for independence, let's consider an example
            <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T092929-0500"?>that<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T092928-0500" content="which"?>
            will illustrate another method that we can use to check whether two events are
            independent:</p>
<example>

<p>A
                <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101201T093757-0500"?>group<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101201T093755-0500" content="class"?>
                of 100 college students were surveyed about their gender and whether they had
                decided on a major. </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image004.gif" alt="A table. The column headings are
&quot;Decided,&quot; &quot;Undecided,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; The rows are
&quot;Female,&quot; &quot;Male,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; Here is the data in
the table in &quot;Row, Column: Value&quot; format.
    Female, Decided: 27;
    Female, Undecided: 33;
    Female, Total: 60;
    Male, Decided: 18;
    Male, Undecided: 22;
    Male, Total: 40;
    Total, Decided: 45;
    Total, Undecided: 55;
    Total, Total: 100;"/>
<p>Offhand, we wouldn't necessarily have any compelling reason to expect that deciding on a major would depend on a student's gender. We can check for independence by comparing the overall probability of being decided to the probability of being decided given that a student is female:</p>
<p>P(D) = 45/100 = .45 and P(D | F) = 27/60 = .45. </p>
<p><?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T102415-0500" comment="You are sying that the two must be exactly equal in order for the events to be independant, but with such a small sample size, I don&apos;t see why a small amount of &quot;inequality&quot; in those equations would necessarily imply any &quot;real&quot; dependence, even though it would imply mathematical dependence. In other words, if one less man were decided in the graph below, I don&apos;t think it would be fair to make the statement that men are less likely to have decided their majors. 

Should there be a note explaining the difference between &quot;not being able to prove mathematical independence&quot; and &quot;being able to prove real-world dependence&quot;?"?>The
                fact that the two are equal<?oxy_comment_end?> tells us that, as we might expect,
                deciding on a major is independent of gender.
                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T093306-0500" content="["?>Note from
                the comment that these must also equal P(D | M), which is 18/40 =
                .45.<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T093309-0500" content="]"?></p>
<p>Now let's approach the issue of independence in a different way: first, we may note that the overall probability of being decided is 45/100 = .45. </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image005.gif" alt="The same table as the previous. Cells will
 be named in &quot;{Row, Column: Value}&quot; format.
            The {Total, Decided: 45} and {Total, Total: 100} cells have been highlighted because they
are the cells used to derive the overall probability of being decided."/>
<p>And the overall probability of being female is 60/100 = .60. </p>
<image style="block" src="../webcontent/image006.gif" alt="The same table again except cells {Female, Total: 60} and
{Total, Total: 100} have been highlighted because those cells are used to calculate the probability of being
female."/>
<p>If being decided is independent of gender, then 45% of the 60% of the class who are female should
                have a decided major; in other words, the probability of being female and decided
                should equal the probability of being female multiplied by the probability of being
                decided. If the events F and D are independent, we should have P(F and D)<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T093438-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>=<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T093438-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>P(F)<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T093439-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>*<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101111T093439-0500"?>
                <?oxy_insert_end?>P(D).</p>
<p>In fact, P(F and D) = 27/100 = .27 = P(F) * P(D) = .45 * .60. This confirms our alternate verification of independence.</p>
</example>
<p>In general, another method for checking the independence of events A and B is to compare P(A and B) to P(A) * P(B).  If the two are equal, then A and B are independent, otherwise the two are not independent.</p>
<p>Let's summarize all the possible methods we've seen for checking the independence of events in one rule:</p>
<p>Two events A and B are independent if any one of the following hold:</p>
<p>P(B | A) = P(B)</p>
<p>P(A | B) = P(A)</p>
<p>P(B | A) = P(B | not A)</p>
<p>P(A and B) =

<p>These various equalities turn out to be equivalent, so that if one equality holds, all are equal,
                    and if one equality does not hold, all are not equal. (This is the case for the
                    same reason that knowing one of

            next activity is to practice checking the independence of two events using the four
            different possible methods that we've provided, and see that all of them will lead us to
            the same conclusion, regardless of which of the four methods we use.</p>
