               service A, what is the probability that it will also reach its destination
               <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T104616-0500" content="by"?><?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T104640-0500"?>through<?oxy_insert_end?>
               service B? When you answer, first write down the conditional probability we are
               looking for, and then find it using the definition of conditional probability: </p>
         <p>P(B | A) = P(A and B) / P(A).</p>

            <p>We are given that the document has arrived on time using service A, and we are
               wondering what the probability is that it will also arrive on time using service B.
               We are therefore looking for P(B | A).</p>
            <p>Using the definition of conditional probability and the probability table, we get
               that:</p>
            <p>P(B | A) = P(A and B) / P(A) = .75/.9 = .833</p>
