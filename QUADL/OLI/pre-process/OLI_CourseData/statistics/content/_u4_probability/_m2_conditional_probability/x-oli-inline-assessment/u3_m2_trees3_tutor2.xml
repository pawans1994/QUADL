               the engine is really overheating? Use the definition of conditional probability, and
               the information you obtained in the previous

         <explanation>
            <p>By the definition of conditional probability, P(H | W) = P(H and W) / P(W).  In the first question we found that P(H and W) = .0294, and that P(W) = .0391.  Therefore: P(H | W) = .0294/.0391 = .752.</p>
            <p>This means that when the warning light is on, there is about a 75% chance that the engine is indeed overheating, and therefore it is advisable for the driver to stop the car and let the engine cool down.</p>
