        <p>This module introduced you to the fundamental concept of

            probability of an event given that another event has occurred. We saw that sometimes the
            knowledge that another event has occurred has no impact on the probability (when the two

            and sometimes it does (when the two events are not independent).</p>
        <p>We further discussed the idea of independence and discussed different ways to check
            whether two events are independent or not.

                <p>Before you do the checkpoint activity, please evaluate your understanding of the learning
                    objectives for the Conditional Probability and Independence module and use the
                    first <em>My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about
                    the material that you would like the instructor to address. Your questions can
                    be for clarification of the material or further insight. Your self-evaluation
                    and questions may also shape the discussions in class.</p>
                <p>Your response will not be graded, but will be available for your instructor to
                    read.
