         <p>What is the probability that the warning light shows up, P(W)? (Recall from previous examples that you need to consider two possibilities here, since a W branch can be reached in two ways. Either the engine is overheated and the warning light is on, or the engine is not overheated and the warning light is on.)</p>

         <explanation>
            <p>The two possibilities that we need to consider here are:</p>
            <p>P(W) = P(H and W) + P(not H and W) = 0.03 * 0.98 + 0.97 * 0.01 = 0.0294 + 0.0097= 0.0391</p>
