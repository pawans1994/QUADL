            <p>Two methods, A and B, are available for teaching a certain industrial skill. There is
                an 80% chance of successfully learning the skill if method A is used, and a 95%
                chance of success if method B is used. However, method B is substantially more
                expensive and is therefore used only 25% of the time (method A is used the other 75%
                of the time). The following notations are suggested: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><em style="bold">A</em>—Method <em style="bold">A</em> is used. </li>
                <li><em style="bold">B</em>—Method <em style="bold">B</em> is used. </li>
                <li><em style="bold"> L</em>—The skill was learned
                    successfully. </li>
            </ul>

                <feedback>Incorrect. This is the probability that the die is less than four, but
