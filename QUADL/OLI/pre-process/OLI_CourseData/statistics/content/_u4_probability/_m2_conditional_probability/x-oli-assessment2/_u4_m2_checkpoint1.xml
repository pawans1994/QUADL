                <feedback>Incorrect. It does not make sense to compare P(L and D) to P(D | L).
                    Recall that being left-handed and being a Democrat are independent if a
                    president being a Democrat doesn’t change the probability that he is
                    left-handed.</feedback>

                <feedback>Incorrect. The president being a Democrat changes the probability
                    that he is left-handed. As a result, the two events cannot be
                    independent.</feedback>
