                                                section, whenever a situation involves more than one
                                                variable, it is generally of interest to determine
                                                whether or not the variables are related. In
                                                probability, we talk about independent events, and
                                                in the first module we said that two events A and B
                                                are <em>independent</em> if
                                                <?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T113406-0500" content="one"?>

                                                will

                                                Now that we've introduced conditional probability,
                                                we can formalize the definition of independence of
                                                events and develop four simple ways to check whether
                                                two events are independent or not. We will introduce
                                                these "independence checks" using examples, and then
                                                summarize.</p>
<example>

<p>Consider again the two-way table for all 500 students in a particular high school, classified according to gender and whether or not they have one or both ears pierced.</p>
    <image style="block" src="../webcontent/image001.gif" alt="The same table of the data for piercings.
The column headings are &quot;Pierced,&quot; &quot;Not Pierced,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; The
Rows are &quot;Male,&quot; &quot;Female,&quot; and &quot;Total.&quot; The data in the cells is
given in &quot;Row, Column:
        Value&quot; format:
        Male, Pierced: 36;
        Male, Not Pierced: 144;
        Male, Total: 180;
        Female, Pierced: 288;
        Female, Not Pierced: 32;
        Female, Total: 320;
        Total, Pierced: 324;
        Total, Not Pierced: 176;
        Total, Total: 500;"/>
<p>Would you expect those two variables to be related? That is, would you expect having pierced ears
                                                  to depend on whether
                                                  <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T110913-0500"?>the
                                                  <?oxy_insert_end?>student is male or female? Or,
                                                  to put it yet another way, would knowing a
                                                  student's gender affect the probability that
                                                  <?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T110934-0500"?>the<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T110934-0500" content="a"?>
                                                  student's ears are pierced? To answer this, we may
                                                  compare the overall probability of having pierced
                                                  ears to the conditional probability of having
                                                  pierced ears, given that a student is male. Our
                                                  intuition would tell us that the latter should be
                                                  lower: male students tend not to have their ears
                                                  pierced, whereas female students do. Indeed, for
                                                  students in general, the probability of having
                                                  pierced ears (event E) is P(E) = 324/500 = .648.
                                                  But the probability of having pierced ears given
                                                  that a student is
                                                  male<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T111011-0500" content=","?>
                                                  is only P(E | M) = 36/180 = .20.</p>
<p>As we anticipated, P(E | M) is lower than P(E). The probability of a student having pierced ears
                changes (in this case, gets lower) when we know that the student is
                male<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T111028-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
                and therefore the events E and M are dependent. (If E and M were independent,
                <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T115331-0500" comment="I understand that you&apos;re using this wording to provide a different way of looking at the issue, but be aware that it might give an impression of causality: the &quot;knowing&quot; wording implies that P(B) changes not because A happened, but because you know that A happened. In other words, it suggests that the fact that a student is male has no affect whatsoever on the probability that his ears are pierced. It is the fact that you know he is male that affects that probability.  "?>knowing

                                                  whether two events are independent is to compare
                                                  <em>P(B | A)</em> and <em>P(B)</em>.</p>
<p>If the two are <em>equal</em> (i.e., knowing or not knowing whether A has occurred has no effect
                                                  on the probability of B occurring) then the two
                                                  events are <em>independent</em>. Otherwise, if the
                                                  <em>probability changes</em> depending on whether
                                                  we know that A has occurred or not, then the two
                                                  events are <em>not independent</em>. Similarly,
                                                  using the same reasoning, we can compare <em>P(A |
                                                  B)</em> and <em>P(A)</em>.</p>

<example>

<p>Recall the side effects example. On the "Information for the Patient" label of a certain
                anti<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T112251-0500" content="-"?>depressant
                it is claimed that based on some clinical trials, there is a 14% chance of
                experiencing sleeping problems known as insomnia (denote this event
                <?oxy_comment_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T112324-0500" comment="remove bold -- no emphasis needed"?>by
                    <em>I</em>), there is a 26% chance of experiencing headache (denote this event
                by <em>H</em>), and there is a 5% chance of experiencing both side effects (<em>I
                    and H</em>).<?oxy_comment_end?></p>
<p>Are the two side effects independent of each other? </p>
<p>To check whether the two side effects are independent, let's compare P(H | I) and P(H).</p>
<p>In the previous part of this module, we found that <em>P(H | I)</em> = P(H and I) / P(I) =
                                                  .05/.14 = <em>.357</em>, while <em>P(H)<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T112411-0500"?>
                                                  <?oxy_insert_end?>=<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T112412-0500"?>
                                                  <?oxy_insert_end?>.26. </em>Knowing that a patient
                                                  experienced insomnia increases the likelihood that
                                                  he/she will also experience headache from .26 to
                                                  .357. The conclusion, therefore is that the two
                                                  side effects are not independent, they are
                                                  dependent.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could have compared P(I<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T112514-0500"?>
                                                  <?oxy_insert_end?>|<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T112515-0500"?>
                                                  <?oxy_insert_end?>H) to P(I). <em> P(I)<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T112518-0500"?>
                                                  <?oxy_insert_end?>=<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20101109T112519-0500"?>
                                                  <?oxy_insert_end?>.14</em>, and previously we
                                                  found that <em>P(I | H)</em> = P(I and H) / P(H) =
                                                  .05/.26 = <em>.1923</em>, and again, since the two
                                                  are not equal, we can conclude that the two side
                                                  effects I and H are dependent.</p>
