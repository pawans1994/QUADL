        <p>This module introduced you to the fundamental concept of

            probability of an event given that another event has occurred. We saw that sometimes the
            knowledge that another event has occurred has no impact on the probability (when the two
            events are <em style="emphasis"

            and sometimes it does (when the two events are not independent).</p>
        <p>We further discussed the idea of independence and discussed different ways to check
            whether two events are independent or not.

                    the material that you would like the instructor to address. Your questions can
