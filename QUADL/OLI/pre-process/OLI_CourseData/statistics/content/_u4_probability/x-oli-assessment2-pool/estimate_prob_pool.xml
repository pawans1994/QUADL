                <feedback>Incorrect. An event will always occur only if its probability is 1. Here,
                    P(A) = 0.99, which means that the event will almost always occur, but after
                    numerous repetitions, the event occasionally will not occur.</feedback>

            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. It is true that if P(A) = 0.99, then it will occur more often
                    than not. However, it is incorrect that it is not extremely likely. P(A) = 0.99
                    is very close to 1, which indicates that event A is extremely likely, but after
                    numerous repetitions, the event occasionally will not occur. </feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. Since P(A) = 0.99 is very close to 1, then event A is extremely
                    likely. In other words, event A will almost always occur, but occasionally, in a long sequence of trials, it will not occur.</feedback>

            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. An event will always occur only if its probability is 1. Here,
                    P(A) = 0.30 which is means that event A will not frequently occur. </feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. Since P(A) = 0.30 is less the 0.50, event A will occur less often
                    than not. Since the probability of 0.30 is not very close to 0, event A is not
                    extremely unlikely. </feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. It is true that since P(A) = 0.30 is less than 0.50, it will
                    not frequently occur. However, an event that occurs 30% of the time is not

        <part>
            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. By definition probabilities can not be less than zero or more
                    than one so this is not a <em style="italic">valid</em> probability. </feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. An event with a probability of 0 is impossible: it cannot
                    happen! </feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. You may have selected this choice because the probability is
                    very small. However, the event is still possible (while very unlikely) if the
                    probability is 0.0001. Note that the event described is <em style="italic">impossible</em>. </feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="D" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. An event with probability 1 is an event that is certain, that
                    is, it <em style="italic">always</em> happens. Note that the event described is
                        <em style="italic">impossible</em>. </feedback>

        <body>
            <p>Which of the following probabilities could describe an event that is likely but not
                certain?</p>

        <part>
            <response match="A" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. An event with a probability of 0.2 is less likely to happen
                    than one with an even chance (50-50), so it could not describe a likely
                    event.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="B" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. An event with a probability of 0.5 is equally likely to happen
                    or not happen, so it would not be a good way to describe an event which is
                    likely.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="C" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. An event with probability more than 0.5 and less than 1 is
                    considered to be likely. </feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="D" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. You may have selected this answer because an event with
                    probability 1 is certain, but the question specifies that the event is not
                    certain. There is a better answer. </feedback>
