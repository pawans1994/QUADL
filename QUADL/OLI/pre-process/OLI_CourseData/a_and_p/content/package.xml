  <title>Anatomy &amp; Physiology</title>
  <description>By taking this course, students will begin to think and speak in the language of the domain, at the same time integrating the knowledge they gain about anatomy to support explanations of physiological phenomena. The course focuses on a few themes that, when taken together, provide a full view of what the human body is capable of and the exciting processes going on inside. The themes are: I. Structure and function of the body, and the connection between the two; II. Homeostasis—the body’s natural tendency to maintain a stable internal environment; III. Levels of organization—the major levels of organization in the human organism, from the chemical and cellular levels to the tissues, organs and organ systems; and IV. Integration of systems, concerning which systems are subsets of larger systems, and how they function together in harmony and conflict. v1.7 20190731</description>
