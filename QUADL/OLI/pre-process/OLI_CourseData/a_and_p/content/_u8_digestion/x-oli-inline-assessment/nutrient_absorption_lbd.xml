                <response match="C" score="10">
                    <feedback>Correct. Proper protein digestion requires hydrochloric acid and proper vitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor, both produced by parietal cells in stomach.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. Gastric juice has no effect on the absorption of these two.</feedback>
                </response>
                <hint>There is a substance in addition to hydrochloric acid that becomes important in the proper absorption of something later in the small intestine.</hint>
