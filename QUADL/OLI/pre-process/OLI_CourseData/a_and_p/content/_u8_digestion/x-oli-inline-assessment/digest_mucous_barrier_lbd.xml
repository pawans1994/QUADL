Antibiotics would do this, not NSAIDs; however, as you will see later, this is one way to help prevent some types of gastric ulcers.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Antacids would do this, not NSAIDs; however, this is one way to reduce short-term the effects of too much gastric acid if someone has gastric ulcers.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. NSAIDS have their pain reducing effect by countering the effect of prostaglandins and resulting symptoms of inflammation anywhere in the body, but in the stomach this can also reduce the ability of the stomach lining to heal itself when damage starts.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. NSAIDs do just the opposite on contact; if they stimulated the mucus it would reduce the risk of gastric ulcers.</feedback></response><hint>Think about what is being countered when you take an anti-inflammatory drug for pain, swelling, or other infection.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
