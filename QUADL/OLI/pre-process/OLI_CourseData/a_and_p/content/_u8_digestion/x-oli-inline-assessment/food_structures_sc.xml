            <body>Some children are born with a birth defect called a cleft palate where the maxilla and palatine bone sutures donâ€™t fuse properly.  Why would this defect often cause trouble eating, frequent middle ear infections, and, if not corrected as a child, affect speech?</body>

                <explanation>Because of the gap in the hard palate, there is a connection between the nasal cavity and mouth.  Swallowed milk can pass out the nasal cavity, rather than down the oropharynx, laryngopharynx and esophagus.  Air can enter the nasal cavity from the mouth, resonating and creating a nasal sound when trying to speak. The Eustachian tube from the middle ear opening in the nasopharynx would not normally be exposed to food and liquid swallowed, but with cleft palate this is more likely to happen.</explanation>
