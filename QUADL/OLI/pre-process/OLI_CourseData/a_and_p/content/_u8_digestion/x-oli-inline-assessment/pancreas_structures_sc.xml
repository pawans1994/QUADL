            <body>Why is no storage structure (similar to the gall bladder for the liverâ€™s bile), needed for the pancreas and its pancreatic juice between meals?</body>

                <explanation>While the liver increases it production of bile when stimulated by hormones, the liver also produces some bile all the time as a part of its other metabolic functions, including destruction of red blood cells and removal of wastes such as biliverden and bilirubin.  The gall bladder stores that bile in-between meals, with hormones controlling the timing of its release into the small intestine. The pancreas is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system and hormones to produce pancreatic juice only as stimulated by steps in the digestive process.  This allows the fine-tuning of the amount of the different enzymes and bicarbonate produced to match the predominant composition of the chyme.</explanation>
