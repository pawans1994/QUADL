            <!--LO:digest_gastric_secretion_LO-->
            <body>The basal antiporter has receptors for gastrin, histamine and acetylcholine, working together.  By blocking histamine, the H2-blocker drug will prevent the movement of which ion to limit the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach?</body>

                <explanation>Chloride ions will be prevented from entering the basal side in exchange for bicarbonate ions.  If chloride doesn’t diffuse into the lumen, there will be less acid produced.</explanation>

            <!--LO:-->
            <body>The proton-pump inhibitors block an apical pump, also resulting in reduced amount of stomach acid.  Which ions are the “protons” that are being prevented from exchange?</body>

                <explanation>Both potassium and hydrogen are protons (positive ions).  Without the exchange, there will be fewer hydrogen ions moved into the lumen to produce hydrochloric acid.</explanation>
