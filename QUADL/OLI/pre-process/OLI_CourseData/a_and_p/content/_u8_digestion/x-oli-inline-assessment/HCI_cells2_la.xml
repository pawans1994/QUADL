            <body>What is the major difference between digestive system cells producing enzymes and those producing hormones?</body>

                <explanation>Those producing enzymes secrete them into a duct that leads to the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract as exocrine secretions.  Those producing hormones secrete them into the blood capillary as endocrine secretions and the blood carries them to a cell with a receptor for that specific hormone.  Both are involved in the digestive process: enzymes as catalysts for digestion in the lumen before absorption; hormones for regulation and coordination of the various digestive system processes, including enzyme production/release and smooth muscle movement.</explanation>
