                <hint>Think about where the chyme has just been before entering the first part of the small intestine.</hint>
                <explanation>Bacteria live in the large intestine and could enter the ilium through the ileocecal sphincter.  The chyme entering the duodenum has just come from the acidic environment of the stomach which will kill most bacteria.</explanation>
