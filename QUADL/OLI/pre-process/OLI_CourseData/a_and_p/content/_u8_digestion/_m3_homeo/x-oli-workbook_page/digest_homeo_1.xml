			<p>With the exception of oxygen from the respiratory system and sunlight (for vitamin D
			formation) from the integumentary system, we obtain all of the materials we need for
			growth and energy from the digestive system. It is through the digestive system that we
			obtain water, nutrients and other essential building blocks for metabolism. However, as
			you know from day to day eating habits, the input into the digestive system can change
			greatly in amount, frequency and content. So it is up to the digestive system to have
			complex processes in place that help maintain homeostasis at various levels in the
			body.</p>
