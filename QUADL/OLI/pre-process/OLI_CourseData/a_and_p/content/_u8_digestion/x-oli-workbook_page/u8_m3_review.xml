So it is up to the digestive system to have complex processes in place that help maintain homeostasis at various levels in the body. Hormonal control (for long distance regulation) and paracrine control (for short distance, or local, regulation) help maintain processes throughout the digestive system that regulate secretion of chemicals, mechanical changes and absorption of nutrients. </p><p id="d1c4c385ed9c4980b365d55313f0a127">The autonomic nervous system provides parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation to the GI tract. In general, parasympathetic nerves increase GI secretion and motility by stimulating neurons of the enteric nervous system, and sympathetic nerves decrease GI secretion and motility by restricting the activity of enteric nervous system neurons. </p><activity idref="_u8_m3_quiz" purpose="quiz" /></body></workbook_page>
