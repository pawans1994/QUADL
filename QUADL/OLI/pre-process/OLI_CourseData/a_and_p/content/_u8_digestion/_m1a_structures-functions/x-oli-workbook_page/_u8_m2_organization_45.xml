		<p>Digestion is accomplished both mechanically and chemically. Mechanical digestion
			physically breaks food into smaller pieces, increasing surface area for more efficient
			chemical digestion. Chemical digestion breaks large food macromolecules down into their
			chemical building blocks, which can then be absorbed through the intestinal wall and
			into the general circulation. </p>

		<p>Food is ingested in the mouth where it begins mechanical digestion from the grinding of
			the teeth and chemical digestion from enzymes in the saliva. Chemical digestion starts
			in the saliva and follows into the stomach. In the stomach material is broken down into
			smaller components by chemically strong acids, enzymes and mechanical churning. However,
			the small intestine is the site of most chemical digestion, and almost all absorption.
			Enzymes, bile, bicarbonate and other materials are mixed in from the pancreas and liver
			to promote chemical digestion and allow enhanced adsorption. Enzymes are
			responsible for the majority of this chemical digestion. The breakdown of fat also requires
			emulsification by bile, secreted by the liver and stored in the gall bladder.</p>
