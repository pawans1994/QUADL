Mucus helps to lubricate food to make it easier to swallow but won’t affect the pH.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Phosphate ions in intrinsic saliva as well as bicarbonate ions in exocrine saliva act as buffers to help maintain the basic pH of the mouth.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This antimicrobial enzyme plays a role in protection from pathogens, not maintaining pH.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Urea is a waste product of protein metabolism that is being eliminated through the saliva, not part of the buffer mechanisms maintaining salivary pH all the time; although urea will increase the pH of the saliva, it’s concentration depends on the production of wastes and is typically high only when there are kidney problems and can then cause gum problems.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
