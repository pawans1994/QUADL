		<p>The tongue is composed of skeletal muscle covered with a surface of nonkeratinized
			stratified squamous epithelium and a mucous membrane covering. The tongue and its
			associated muscles make up the floor of the oral cavity. A median septum extends the
			entire length of the tongue, dividing it into symmetrical halves. Inferiorly, the tongue
			is attached to the mandible, styloid process of the temporal bone, and hyoid bone.</p>

		<p>Each half of the tongue has the same number and type of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles.
			As you learned in your studies of the muscular system, extrinsic muscles of the tongue are the <em style="italic"
			>hyoglossus</em>, <em style="italic">genioglossus</em>, <em style="italic">styloglossus
				and palatoglossus muscles</em>. These muscles originate outside the tongue and
			insert into connective tissues within the tongue. They move the tongue from side to side
			and in and out, performing three important digestive functions: (1) moving food for
			optimal chewing, (2) shaping food into a bolus (rounded mass), (3)
			pushing food toward the back of the mouth to be swallowed and (4) elevates the posterior
			part of the tongue to assist in swallowing. Conscious control of the tongue also aids in
			speaking and other non-digestive processes.</p>
		<p>The intrinsic muscles are the <em style="italic">longitudinalis superior</em>, <em
				style="italic">longitudinalis inferior</em>, <em style="italic">transversus
				linguae</em>, and <em style="italic">verticalis linguae muscles</em> (lingua and
			lingual refers to the tongue). These muscles both originate in and insert into
			connective tissues within the tongue. They change the size and shape of the tongue to
			facilitate swallowing and speech. A fold of mucous membrane in the middle inferior
			region (underside) of the tongue, the <term>lingual frenulum</term>, attaches
			to the floor of the mouth and limits the tongue's posterior movement. People with a
			condition called <term>ankyloglossia</term> have a too short or too rigid
			lingual frenulum, which impairs their speech. As a result, they are sometimes referred
			to as "tongue-tied."</p>
		<p>The top and sides of the tongue are studded with <term>papillae</term>
			("nipple-shaped") extensions of lamina propria layer of mucosa, which are enshrouded in
			stratified squamous epithelium. Most of these papillae contain taste buds; those without
			taste buds have touch receptors to give a sense of foodâ€™s texture. The latter increase
			the amount of friction between the tongue and food, which helps the tongue move food
			around in the mouth. Lingual glands, are found on the anterior, inferior surface of the
			tongue, in the lamina propria of the tongue secrete mucus and a watery serous fluid that
			contains the enzyme <term>lingual lipase</term>, which begins the digestion of
			triglycerides.</p>
