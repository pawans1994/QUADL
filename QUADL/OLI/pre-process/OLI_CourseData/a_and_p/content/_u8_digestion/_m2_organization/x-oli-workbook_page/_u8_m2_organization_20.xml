		<p>Lying outside the oral mucosa are the three pairs of <term>major salivary
				glands</term>, which secrete the majority of saliva into ducts that open into the
			mouth. The <term>parotid glands</term> lie between the skin and the masseter
			muscle near the ears. They secrete saliva into the mouth through the <term>parotid duct</term>, which is located near the second upper molar tooth. The <term>submandibular glands</term>, which are in the floor of the mouth, secrete
			saliva into the mouth through the <term>submandibular ducts</term> near the
			lower central incisor. The <term>sublingual glands</term>, which lie below the
			tongue, use the <term>lesser sublingual ducts </term>to secrete saliva into the
			oral cavity.</p>

		<p>Different salivary glands secrete unique formulations of saliva according to their
			cellular makeup. For example, the parotid glands secrete a watery solution that contains
			salivary amylase. The submandibular glands have cells similar to those of the parotid
			glands, along with some mucous-secreting cells. So saliva secreted by the submandibular
			glands also contains amylase but in a liquid thickened with mucus. The sublingual glands
			contain mostly mucous cells, and they secrete the thickest saliva with the least amount
			of salivary amylase.</p>
			
	<example>
		<title>Homeostatic Imbalances of the Parotid Glands: Mumps</title>
		
			<p>Infections of the nasal passages and pharynx can attack any salivary glands. The
				parotid glands are the usual site of infection with the virus that causes mumps (<em
					style="italic">Paramyxovirus</em>). Mumps manifest with enlargement and
				inflammation of the parotid glands, causing the characteristic swelling between the
				ears and the jaw. Symptoms include fever and throat pain, which can be severe when
				swallowing acidic substances such as orange juice.</p>
			<p>In about one third of men who are past puberty, mumps also causes testicular
				inflammation, typically affecting only one testis and thus rarely resulting in
				sterility. The incidence of mumps has dropped considerably since 1967, when a
				vaccine was introduced.</p></example>
		
		<p>The autonomic nervous system regulates <term>salivation</term> (the secretion of
			saliva). An average of 1 to 1.6 quarts (0.9-1.5 liters) of saliva is secreted each day.
			In the absence of food, parasympathetic stimulation keeps saliva flowing continuously to
			moisten mucous membranes and lubricate tongue and lip movements when we talk; swallowed
			saliva moistens the esophagus. Most saliva is reabsorbed, preventing fluid loss. During
			times of stress, sympathetic stimulation takes over, reducing serous salivation and
			causing dry mouth. When you are dehydrated, salivation stops to conserve water, causing
			the mouth dryness that helps stimulate feelings of thirst. Having a drink restores body
			water homeostasis and moistens the mouth.</p>
		<p>Salivation from the major salivary glands is stimulated by both the taste and sensation
			of food. Food contains chemicals that stimulate taste bud receptors on the tongue, which
			send impulses to the <term>superior</term> and <term>inferior
				salivatory nuclei</term> in the brain stem. These two nuclei then send back
			parasympathetic impulses through fibers in the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves to
			stimulate salivation. Even after we swallow food, salivation is increased to cleanse the
			mouth and to dilute and neutralize any irritating chemical remnants -- such as that hot
			sauce in your burrito. Salivation can also be stimulated by simply thinking about,
			seeing, or smelling food.</p>
