		<p>Millions of deep <em style="bold">gastric pits </em>in the epithelium lead into <em
				style="bold">gastric glands</em>, which secrete <em style="bold">gastric juice</em>.
			The walls of the gastric pits are made up primarily of epithelial cells. The gastric
			glands are made up of different types of cells. Glands of the cardia and pylorus are
			composed primarily of mucus-secreting cells. Cells that make up the pyloric antrum
			secrete mucus and a number of hormones, including gastrin. The much larger glands of the
			fundus and body of the stomach, the site of most chemical digestion, produce most of the
			gastric secretions. These glands are made up of a variety of secretory cells, including
			mucous neck, parietal, chief, and enteroendocrine cells (G-cells).</p>
