Enzymes are proteins which are macromolecules and are bigger than an ion.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. HCL is a small acid, then bile salts are larger macromolecule that have a steroid structure, secretory cells are larger than just macromolecules and the small intestine is an organ that is larger than a single cell.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This order would be from largest to smallest. The stomach is part of the GI tract so is smaller than it.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Epithelial cells are larger than bile which is a macromolecule.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
