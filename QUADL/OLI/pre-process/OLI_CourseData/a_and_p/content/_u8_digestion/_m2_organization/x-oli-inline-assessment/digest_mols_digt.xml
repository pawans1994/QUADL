Although hydrolysis will release some energy during digestion, cellular energy is produced inside individual cells.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Hydrolysis may be catalyzed by enzymes, but it does not build them.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Hydrolysis is involved in the breaking of chemical bonds and can happen spontaneously.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Hydrolysis is the process that breaks macromolecules into smaller parts that can be absorbed by the small intestine.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
