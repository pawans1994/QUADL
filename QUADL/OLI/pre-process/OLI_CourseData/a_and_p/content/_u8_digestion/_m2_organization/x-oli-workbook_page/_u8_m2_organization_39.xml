		<p>The liver has three main components: hepatocytes, bile canaliculi, and hepatic sinusoids.
			Between adjacent hepatocytes, grooves in the cell membranes provide room for <em
				style="bold">bile canaliculi </em>("small canals"). These small ducts accumulate the
			bile produced by hepatocytes. From here, bile flows first into bile ductules and then
			into bile ducts. The bile ducts unite and form the larger <em style="bold">right
			</em>and <em style="bold">left hepatic ducts</em>, which themselves merge and exit the
			liver as the <em style="bold">common hepatic duct</em>. This duct then joins with the
			cystic duct from the gall bladder, forming the <em style="bold">common bile duct
			</em>through which bile flows into the small intestine. Bile production increases when
			fat-rich chyme stimulates the release of secretin from intestinal cells. Between meals,
			when most absorption is complete, the hepatopancreatic sphincter prevents bile flow into
			the duodenum, and bile backs up into the gall bladder, where it is stored until
			needed.</p>
