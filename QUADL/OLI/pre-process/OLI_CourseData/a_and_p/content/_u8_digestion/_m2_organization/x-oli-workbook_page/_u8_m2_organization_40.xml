		<p><em style="bold">Hepatic sinusoids </em>are specialized blood vessels, more like dilated
			channels, located between rows of hepatocytes. Branches of the hepatic artery deliver
			oxygenated blood to hepatic sinusoids; while branches of the hepatic portal vein deliver
			nutrient-laden blood. The hepatic sinusoids combine and send blood into a <em
				style="bold">central vein</em>. Blood then flows into the <em style="bold">hepatic
				veins</em>, which drain into the inferior vena cava. This means that blood and bile
			flow in opposite directions. The hepatic sinusoids also contain the immune cells called
				<em style="bold">Kupffer cells</em>. A distinctive arrangement in the liver called
			the <em style="bold">portal triad </em>includes three basic structures: a bile duct, a
			hepatic artery branch, and a hepatic portal vein branch.</p>
