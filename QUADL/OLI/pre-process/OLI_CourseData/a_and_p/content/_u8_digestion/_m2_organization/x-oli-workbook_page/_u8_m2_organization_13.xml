				<p>There are many species of bacteria that populate the large intestines. They
					digest food products for which we do not have enzymes (such as plant materials)
					and we absorb some of the nutrient products. They can also produce some vitamins
					like vitamin K and B vitamins. A byproduct of bacterial fermentation (digestion)
					is gas (flatus).</p>
				<p>Although the bacteria provide additional nutrients from the food we ingest, they
					can also infect us. Because of the large and diverse bacterial population that
					resides in the large intestine, the large intestine also contains plentiful
					lymphatic tissue to protect us from potentially harmful effects of resident
					bacteria.</p>
