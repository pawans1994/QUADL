		<p>The <term>gall bladder</term> stores and concentrates the bile produced by the
			liver. The green colored gall bladder lies in a shallow area on the posterior surface of
			the right lobe of the liver. This pear-shaped sac, which is about 3-4 inches (7-10 cm)
			long, usually suspends from the anterior inferior margin of the liver. The gall bladder
			is divided into three regions. The wide <term>fundus</term> runs inferiorly,
			past the inferior border of the liver. The central portion of the gall bladder is called
			the <term>body</term>, and the tapered portion the <term>neck</term>.
			These two areas project superiorly.</p>

		<p>The simple columnar epithelium of the gall bladder mucosa is organized in rugae, similar
			to those of the stomach. There is no submucosa in the gall bladder wall. The wall's
			middle, muscular coat is made of smooth muscle fibers. When these fibers contract, the
			gall bladder's contents are released into the <term>cystic duct</term>.
			Visceral peritoneum forms the outer coat of the gall bladder.</p>
