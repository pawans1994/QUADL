Proteins are denatured by the chemical HCl. This acid unfolds proteins.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. By breaking down the food into smaller pieces the enzymes of chemical digestion are able to more efficiently digest the food.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. HCl is an acid that is already in its active form.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The larger the molecules the smaller the surface area to volume ratio and the less effective the digestive enzymes are.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
