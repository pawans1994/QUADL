The amide is the molecule whose chemical bond is being broken. Water is the molecules that is being added to break it.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Water is added to break a chemical bond and results in the degradation of a large molecule.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Hydrolysis is the process of bond being broken by water and two smaller molecules being formed.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. In hydrolysis, water is broken into H+ and OH- . One of the smaller molecules receives the H+ and one receives the OH-.</feedback></response><hint>Hydro- means water and â€“lysed means broken.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
