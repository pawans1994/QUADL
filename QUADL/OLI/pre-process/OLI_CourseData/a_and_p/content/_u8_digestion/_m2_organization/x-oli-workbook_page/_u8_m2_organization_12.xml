			<title>Small Intestine Exocrine Function</title>
			<body>
				<p>The small intestine is primarily composed of simple columnar epithelial cells
					with microvilli facing the lumen for absorption of digested material.
						<term>Intestinal crypts</term> (also called the <term>crypts of
						Lieberk√ºhn</term>) are analogous to gastric glands of the stomach and are
					formed by invaginations of the epithelium. Within the crypts are <term>paneth
						cells</term>, which secrete multiple defensive proteins including lysozyme
					definsins and phospholipase to protect the small intestine from pathogens which
					have survived the stomach compartment. There are also <term>Goblet cells</term>,
					which secrete mucous for protection from the acids of the stomach and enzymes
					from accessory organs.</p>
			</body>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Small Intestine Endocrine Function</title>
			<body>
				<p>The small intestine also has <term>enteroendocrine cells</term> which secrete
					hormones for regulation of absorption of nutrients. <term>S cells</term> produce
					secretin to buffer intestinal pH. <term>I cells</term> (also called <term>CCK
						cells</term>) secrete <term>cholecystokinin</term>, which stimulates the
					release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and gall bladder in to the
					intestine. <term>K cells</term> secrete <term>gastric inhibitory peptide</term>
						(<term>GIP</term>; also called <var>glucose-dependent insulinotropic
						peptide</var>), which influences insulin levels</p>

			<title>Large Intestine Exocrine Function</title>
			<body>
				<p>Most of the mucosa of the large intestine is composed of simple columnar
					epithelial cells. An exception is the distal anal canal, which is composed of
					nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelial cells. The stratified epithelium
					is more durable to the abrasion that occurs when feces moves. The large
					intestine also has crypts, which contain both epithelial cells and goblet cells.
					Since most digestion and absorption occurs before the large intestine, the only
					significant secretion is mucus, which lubricates the passage of digestive
					residue.</p>
