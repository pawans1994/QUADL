			<title>Exocrine Function</title>

			<body>
				<p><term>Hepatocytes</term> are the liver's main functional cells (hepato – liver,
					cytes – cells). They play a role in a wide variety of secretory, metabolic, and
					endocrine functions. Hepatocytes account for around 80 percent of the liver's
					volume. Plates of hepatocytes called hepatic laminae (singular lamina) radiate
					out from the center of hepatic lobules. Hepatocytes continually secrete bile,
					but production and release accelerate when bile acid levels in the hepatic
					portal blood (blood coming from the small intestine) increase. This means more
					bile is secreted as digestion and absorption are proceeding in the small
					intestine.</p>

			<body>
				<p>The liver also contains star-shaped <term>Kupffer cells</term> that are found in
					the blood filled spaces (sinusoids) between <term>laminae</term>. These
					phagocytic cells remove dead or damaged red and white blood cells, as well as
					bacteria and other foreign material that potentially enter through the GI tract
					and travel to the liver in the hepatic portal vein.</p>
