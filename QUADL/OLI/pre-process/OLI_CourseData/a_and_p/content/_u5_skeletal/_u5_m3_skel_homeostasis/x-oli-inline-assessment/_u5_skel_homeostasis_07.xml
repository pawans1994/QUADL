      <body>How do you think common treatments for rheumatoid arthritis affect the rest of the body?</body>

<multiple_choice>
      <choice value="pain_joint">pain in the joints</choice>
      <choice value="infection">increased susceptibility to infection</choice>
      <choice value="broken">increased risk of broken bones</choice>
      <choice value="lupus">cause lupus, an autoimmune disorder</choice>

            <response match="pain_joint" score="0">
                  <feedback>Incorrect. Treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) usually try to reduce the symptom of joint pain.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="infection" score="10">
                  <feedback>Correct. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involves the body's own immune system attacking stressed cartilage. Thus, to treat RA, the immune system must be suppressed. With a weakened immune system, there is an increase risk of infection.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="broken" score="0">
                  <feedback>This is not quite right. Some hormonal therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can increase the risk of some types of fracture, but generally this is not an issue. </feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="lupus" score="0">
                  <feedback>Incorrect. Lupus is another autoimmune disorder, and many times rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lupus are treated the same way.</feedback>
