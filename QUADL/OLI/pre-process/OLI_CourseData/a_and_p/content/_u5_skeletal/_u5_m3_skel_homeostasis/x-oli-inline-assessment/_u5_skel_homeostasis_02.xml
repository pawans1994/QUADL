What impact, if any, would you expect hyperparathyroidism to have on the skeletal system? </p></body><multiple_choice><choice value="weak_bone">weak bones</choice><choice value="brittle_bone">very strong bones</choice><choice value="no_change">no change</choice><choice value="altered_artic">altered articulations</choice></multiple_choice><part id="i5d2f43c876d1490c9b6a52d57c2e9ed8"><skillref idref="skeletal_homeo_bone_SKILL" /><response match="weak_bone" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Hyperparathyroidism leads to excessive amounts of calcium being removed from bone, making them weak. It can also lead to problems in nervous and muscular function because of the high plasma calcium levels the result from this condition. </feedback></response><response match="brittle_bone" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Parathyroid hormone stimulates calcium loss from bone. This would not make them stronger</feedback></response><response match="no_change" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Parathyroid hormone levels can have significant impact on bones</feedback></response><response match="altered_artic" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Over a long period of time this might occur, but it is secondary to weaker bones, which often leads to fracture.</feedback></response><hint>Think about the effect that parathyroid hormone has on bone.</hint></part></question></assessment>
