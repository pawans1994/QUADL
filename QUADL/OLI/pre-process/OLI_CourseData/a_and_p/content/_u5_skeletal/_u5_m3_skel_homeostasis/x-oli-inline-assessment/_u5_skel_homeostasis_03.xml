It can be dangerous to alter calcium levels in the body, since they impact many organ systems. </feedback></response><response match="inhibit_clasts" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Regulation of the bone system, such as through parathyroid hormone and calcitonin, impacts osteoclast function. Osteoblasts are left to build and strengthen bone.</feedback></response><response match="inhibit_blasts" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Osteoblasts are often left unaffected in homeostatic regulation. Also, since osteoblasts are related to osteoclasts, they are difficult to regulate singularly.</feedback></response><response match="alter_calcitonin" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This hormone is difficult to produce synthetically.</feedback></response><no_response><feedback>You did not answer the question.</feedback></no_response><hint>Phosphonates act in a way that is similar to how the endocrine system acts.</hint></part></question></assessment>
