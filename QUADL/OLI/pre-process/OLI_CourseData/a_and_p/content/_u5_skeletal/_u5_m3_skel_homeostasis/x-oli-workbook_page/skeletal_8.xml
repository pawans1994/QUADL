From the time that we are born, our skeleton must be sufficiently robust to provide stature, protect our soft internal organs and provide a mechanical resistance for our muscles to pull on. However, in addition to the constant need for the skeleton to maintain its function, it must also constantly remodel, otherwise we could not grow. Even in adulthood we constantly develop microfractures that need to be repaired.</p></body></workbook_page>
