When you eat those proteins, your digestive system completely breaks them down. Clinical studies have shown no benefit to ingesting supplements or increased protein.</feedback></response><response match="rest" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Unfortunately, without invasive treatment (such as surgery) it just takes time for cells to secrete more extracellular matrix. It is important that the affected person not injure the articulation further during healing. </feedback></response><response match="gene" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.
