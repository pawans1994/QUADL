                        <p>After bone formation, bone <term>resorption</term> and bone <term>deposition</term> occur continually in a process called <term>bone remodeling</term> to allow for skeletal response to mechanical use, nutritional
            status and as part of the bone repair and healing process. In the absence of
            malnutrition or disease, this process maintains homeostasis of both total bone mass and
            inorganic substances such as calcium and phosphate.</p>
                        <p>As bones age, they tend to decrease in density and, as a consequence, decrease
                            in strength. In some people, especially women, the bones become very brittle and
                            easily broken. The result is a disorder called <extra><anchor><term>osteoporosis</term></anchor>
                                <pronunciation src="../../../webcontent/terms_audio/osteoporosis.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></pronunciation>
                            </extra>. Within bones affected by osteoporosis, bone mass and
                            mineral content decrease. As a result, the bones develop canals filled with
                            fibrous and fatty tissues. This leads to an increased risk of bone fracture
                            because the bone organization that is important to weight bearing is lost. </p>
