                <p>You can think of the hydroxyapatite in bones as being similar to concrete. The
            chemical structure of hydroxyapatite gives it a high mechanical strength under
            compression (squeezing force), but little strength under tension (pulling force). If our
            bones were made only of hydroxyapatite, they would be very fragile, like concrete. They
            would break easily under tension. The organic components of bone help to give it
            additional strength and flexibility. </p>
        <p>Collagen, a ropelike, fibrous protein, is the major organic component of bone. Like rope,
            collagen has significant mechanical strength under tension. Therefore, collagen provides
            tensile strength to the bones. The spiral arrangement of collagen in combination with
            its ECM

            matrix) <?oxy_insert_end?>components, such as water and specialized proteins, also makes
            bone more elastic and less brittle, so that it can absorb shock more easily.</p>
                <p>Bone matrix is a network of collagen fibers and hydroxyapatite. It is strong
                    under both tension and compression. Furthermore, the collagen contributes to its
                    ability to absorb sudden forces without breaking.</p>

                easily<?oxy_insert_end?>. Also, these stiff structures resist compression (squeezing
                force) but not tension (pulling force). Collagen is a ropelike material

                there are several fibers wrapped around one another. Like rope, you can pull on it
                and it's strong; it resists tension very well.

                if you push on a rope it easily bends. Collagen, like a

                rope, is also spongy and acts like a shock absorber. When you mix both of these
                materials together you get bone. It's strong under both tension and compression and
                can absorb sudden forces.<?oxy_comment_end?>
