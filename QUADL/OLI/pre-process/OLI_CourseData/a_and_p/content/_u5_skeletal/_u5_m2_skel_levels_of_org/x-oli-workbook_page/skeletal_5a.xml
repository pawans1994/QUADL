        <p>The skeletal system is organized into the following structural hierarchy, from
            microstructure to gross anatomy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em style="italic">Chemistry and molecular scale</em> - Water, minerals, collagen, and other proteins.</li>
            <li><em style="italic">Nanoscale</em> - Mineral crystals are embedded within collagen to form composite
                fibers.</li>
            <li><em style="italic">Submicron scale</em> - Mineralized fibrils are organized into a <extra>
                    <anchor><term>lamella</term></anchor>
                    <pronunciation src="../../../webcontent/terms_audio/lamella.mp3"
                        type="audio/mp3"/>
                </extra> (plural is "lamellae").</li>
            <li><em style="italic">Micron (micrometer) scale</em> - Lamellae form osteons in compact bone or trabeculae in
                spongy bone.</li>
            <li><em style="italic">Macroscale</em> - Compact and spongy bone combine together to form whole bones, and bones
                combine at articulations to form the skeletal system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bones constantly store and release calcium, phosphate, proteins, and other matrix
            components of bone. Within the matrix, the mineral crystals resist compression but are
            very brittle. The organic components, such as the collagen fibers and the cells, help
            give the bone some flexibility. The hierarchical organization of the skeletal system at
            different scales is important for its mechanical, biological, and chemical
            functions.</p>

            <title>Molecules and Macromolecules</title>
            <body>
            <p>The major components of bone tissue at the molecular scale are minerals, water,
                    collagen, and other proteins. At the next level of organization, small crystals
                    of hydroxyapetite made of calcium and phosphate embed within collagen fibers to
                    produce a composite (blended) material with high compressive and tensile
                    strength.</p>
                <p>The skeletal system protects and supports vital organs, allows our body to move,
                    stores important minerals, and produces blood cells. There are several chemical
                    elements and molecules required to maintain the many functions of the skeletal
                    system. The chemical properties of these components support bone structure and
                    function. On a chemical level, bone is divided into inorganic and organic
                    (carbon-containing) components.</p>
                <p>The primary inorganic components of bone are</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em style="bold">calcium</em>, which is required for many functions
                        throughout the body</li>
                    <li><em style="bold">phosphorus</em> (in the form of phosphate ions), which is a
                        component of buffer systems and energy-rich molecules</li>
                    <li><em style="bold">water</em>, which contributes to the compressive resistance
                        of bone and contributes to the fluid matrix of bone</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The primary organic components of bone are</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em style="bold">collagen</em>, the major structural protein (type I in bone
                        and type II in cartilage)</li>
                    <li><em style="bold">proteoglycans</em>, which are negatively charged
                        glycosylated proteins (glycosylated means to have carbohydrate sugar groups
                        modifying the protein)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Bone is approximately 60-70% inorganic mineral and 10% water by weight. The
                    remaining 20-30% of bone is organic matrix (osteoid), such as collagen and
                    proteoglycans. Your body contains 1 to 2 kg of calcium and nearly 600 g of
                    phosphorous. Nearly 99% of calcium and 86% of phosphorous is stored in stored in
                    your bones.</p>

            <title>I. Inorganic components of bone</title>
            <body>
                <p>Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are stored in bone tissue, but can be released
                    into the bloodstream when the values there fall below the homeostatic set point.
                    Blood calcium is important for muscle contractions, nerve impulses, and blood
                    clotting.</p>
                <p>In bone, phosphorous (P) is found in the form of phosphate ions
                        (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>). Outside of bone phosphorous plays roles in
                    energy storage (such as in ATP), and is required for the formation of DNA and
                    RNA. Therefore it is required for cellular growth, maintenance, and tissue
                    repair. </p>
                <p>When combined with hydrogen, phosphorous forms dihydrogen phosphate ions
                    (H2PO4-). Dihydrogen phosphate acts as a buffer to maintain constant pH by
                    acting as either a hydrogen ion donor (acid) or a hydrogen ion acceptor (base).
                    In all cells, a constant pH must be maintained to carry out cell functions. </p>
                <p>As mentioned in previous sections, hydroxyapatite is an inorganic calcium
                    phosphate mineral that is a primary component of bone. crystal Hydroxyapatite
                    has the chemical formula:
                        Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>. </p>
                <p>During bone formation, the collagen fiber matrix is first deposited.
                    Mineralization of the matrix occurs when calcium, phosphate, and water from the
                    extracellular fluids combine to form insoluble hydroxyapatite. The
                    hydroxyapatite incorporates into the small pores within collagen fibrils and
                    crystallizes into long, thin, nanosized plates within the collagen network. The
                    incorporation of hydroxyapatite within the collagen fibers contributes to the
                    overall compressive strength of bone. Because the crystals are nanosized, they
                    have a large surface area. The large surface area of the crystals makes it easy
                    to release ions into the extracellular fluids when necessary.</p>
                <p>Sometimes bones contain fluoride. Fluoride is similar to the hydroxyl ion in
                    charge and size. When fluoride replaces the hydroxyl ion in hydroxyapatite
                    crystals, it forms fluoroapatite. Fluoroapatite is a more compact and less
                    soluble crystal when compared with hydroxyapatite. Therefore, ion exchange at
                    the crystal surface is slower. The primary role of fluoride in bone is to
                    strengthen bone mineral.</p>
                <p>Water is an important molecular component of bone matrix. Water is initially
                    present in the spaces within the collagen matrix of the unmineralized bone
                    extracellular matrix (osteoid). As crystals fill in the spaces between collagen
                    fibrils, bone is mineralized and water is displaced. The final amount of water
                    in bone forms hydrogen bonds with polar, hydrophilic components of collagen.
                    Water also assists with the compressive resistance of bone due to osmotic
                    interactions caused by negatively charged proteoglycans .</p>
                <p>In addition to calcium, phosphorous, water, and fluoride, the inorganic phase of
                    bone also contains sodium, potassium, carbonate, and magnesium. Although these
                    molecules do not form their own crystals, they are bound to hydroxyapatite
                    crystals within bone mineral.</p>

            <title>II. Organic components of bone</title>
            <body>
                <p>Collagens are a class of fibrous proteins found in bone, cartilage, and other
                    connective tissues. The primary structure of collagen has repeats of
                    glycine-proline-X, where X can be any other amino acid. This repeated
                    arrangement gives collagen a unique left-handed helical form in its secondary
                    structure. The tertiary structure of collagen is a triple helix fibril, called
                    tropocollagen. In the presence of water, tropocollagen molecules form the
                    quaternary structure of collagen. The tropocollagen helices twist together in a
                    right-handed super coil to form a collagen fiber.</p>
                <p>Type-1 collagen is the primary form of collagen found in bone. The collagen
                    fibers in bone are approximately 300 nm long, and are arranged in a staggered
                    pattern. During bone formation, the collagen fiber matrix is first deposited.
                    Proteoglycans are a second class of organic components found in bone.
                    Proteoglycans are macromolecules composed of proteins with negatively charged
                    glycosylated modifications. There are a number of proteoglycans, which are
                    classified by the type of side chains on the core protein. The side chains on
                    the proteoglycans are linear carbohydrates. As with cartilage, the presence of
                    the negatively charged proteoglycans contribute to the resilience of the tissue
                    and retention of water within the matrix. Proteoglycans also bind and release
                    molecules for cell signaling.</p>

            <body>
                <p>Mineralization of the matrix occurs when calcium, phosphate, and water from the
                    extracellular fluids combine to form insoluble hydroxyapatite. The
                    hydroxyapatite incorporates into the small pores within collagen fibrils and
                    crystallizes into long, thin, nanosized plates within the collagen network. The
                    incorporation of hydroxyapatite within the collagen fibers contributes to the
                    overall compressive strength of bone. Because the crystals are nanosized, they
                    have a large surface area. Within the bone matrix, the minerals, water,
                    collagens, and proteoglycans function together to provide strength in tension
                    and compression. Additionally, this unique environment binds and releases
                    chemicals into the extracellular fluids for use throughout the body.</p>

                            style="italic">-</em>, meaning bone, and <em style="italic"
                                >genesis</em>, meaning production or beginning) is a congenital (genetic)
                        disorder that affects the structure and strength of bones. The condition is
                        primarily caused by genetic mutations that affect the structure and/or
                        quantity of type-I collagen produced by the body. Remember that collagen is
                        an important component of the extracellular matrix of bone tissue. In people
                        with osteogenesis imperfecta, the lack of collagen (or defective collagen)
                        prevents the extracellular matrix from forming correctly. The mineral
                        structure of the bone is weakened, and as a result, the bones are unusually
                        brittle.</p>
                    <p>The bones of people with osteogenesis imperfecta break extremely easily,
                        sometimes with only small amounts of pressure. Their brittleness reduces
                        their ability to support and protect the body. They also typically take
                        longer to heal and may be more prone to infection.</p>
                    <p>Bones become stronger and thicker when they are exposed to regular stress.
                        Conversely, bones that do not experience regular stress may lose extracellular
                        matrix and become less dense. In a person with osteogenesis imperfecta, bones
                        that break often (and therefore spend a lot of time immobilized in casts or
                        restraints) are exposed to much less stress. As a result, they may lose even
                        more extracellular matrix and become even more brittle.</p>
