                <p>The bones of your body are mineralized structures that make up a major portion of
                    your skeleton. In the broad sense, a bone is composed of bone tissue, cartilage,
                    ligaments, tendons, vasculature, and nervous tissue. Bone tissue is a collection
                    of specialized cells (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes), organic
                    extracellular matrix proteins (collagen and proteoglycans) and inorganic salt
                    crystals that work together to provide strength and flexibility. </p>
