            <feedback>Incorrect. Osteons are organized in the direction of force so that they can
               resist tension and compression in the direction of force. For example, standing puts compressive
               forces on the long bones of the legs. </feedback>

            <feedback>Correct. Spongy bone contains a mesh-like structure of trabeculae plates. The
               random orientation helps distribute forces in many directions and acts as a shock
               absorber.. It is not completely random as greater trabecular density generally occurs 
               in the directions experiencing the most force.</feedback>
