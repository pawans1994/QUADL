        <p>It's common to think of the skeletal system as being made up of only bones, and
            performing only the function of supporting the body. However, the skeletal system

            and performs a variety of functions for the body.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to bones, the skeletal system contains several important connective tissues:

            <p>Cartilage is a firm yet elastic substance that performs a 
            variety of functions: protection, shape maintenance and support, lubrication, and shock absorption. 
            
                <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/Gray332-cartilage-sm.png" alt="normal cartilage in elbow joint"></image>
                
            Cartilage is an important component of the vertebrae, many joints, and the trachea. Furthermore, 
            cartilage can serve as a template for bone formation during development and bone healing.</p>
        
        <p>Ligaments and tendons support and control the movement of your bones and muscles. Ligaments connect bones to one another; tendons connect bones to muscles. </p>
        <image style="block" src="../../webcontent/Gray358-tendon-lig.png" alt="tendons and ligaments in the ankle"></image>
       
            <p>The structures of ligaments and tendons are similar, in that both tissues are made of aligned fibrous proteins. The types of proteins and differences in 
                elasticity distinguish the mechanical behavior of ligaments and tendons. </p>
                <p>Importantly, these structures limit the range of motion of joints, so that joint movement is well controlled and skeletal injury does not occur. </p>
