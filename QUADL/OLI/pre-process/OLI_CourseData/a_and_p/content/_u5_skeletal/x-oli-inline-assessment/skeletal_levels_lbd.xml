The collagen fibers are aligned in parallel sheets to form lamellae.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Trabeculae are not formed from osteons and are not found in compact bone. They are found in spongy bone.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Mineral crystals are the smallest level and osteons are found in compact bone.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. One of the answers above is correct.</feedback></response><hint>Microstructure is the smallest part so the order should be smallest to largest. Starting with Nanoscale.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
