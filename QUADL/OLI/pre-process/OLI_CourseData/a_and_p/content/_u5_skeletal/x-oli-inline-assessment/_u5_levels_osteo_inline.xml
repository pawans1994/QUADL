Although true, this is not the best answer to this question.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="1"><feedback>Correct. The structure is affected at all levels. Mutations from glycine amino acids to other amino acids prevent the organization of the gly-pro-x (glycine-proline-X) into a left-handed helix (secondary structure) leading to &quot;coiled coil&quot; collagen tertiary and quaternary structures. This ultimately leads to bones that crack too easily because of poorly organized collagen. </feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.
