On a micron scale the lamellae form osteons which have a central canal that the blood vessels pass through. When the bone fractures the blood vessels break also. With a lack of blood bone cells begin to die which effects the bone structure. A fracture weakens the macroscale structure of the bone and if it heals improperly can change the ability of the bone to do its function.</explanation></part></question></page></assessment>
