The ligaments stabilize articulations. With ACL injuries, the knee is unstable and can even separate.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is the job of a tendon. Tendons connect bones to muscles; ligaments connect bone to bone, and stabilize articulations.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is the job of the cartilage. There are many examples of cartilage injury in the knee, but it is different than an ACL (ligament) tear.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.
