        <question id="_u5_m1_knee_inline1">
            <body>The knee allows movement independently front to back and by rotation. As such it is classified into two articulation types. What are they? </body>
            <multiple_choice shuffle="false" id="ans">
                <choice value="glide_hinge">gliding and hinge</choice>
                <choice value="pivot_saddle">pivot and saddle</choice>
                <choice value="pivot_hinge">pivot and hinge</choice>
                <choice value="hinge_ellipsoid">hinge and ellipsoid</choice>

                <response match="glide_hinge" score="0">
                    <feedback>That is not quite right. Hinge is correct but gliding moves out of plane; pivot is correct.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="pivot_saddle" score="0">
                    <feedback>That is not quite right. Saddle move in multiple directions, but are not as strong as hinges.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="pivot_hinge" score="1">
                    <feedback>Correct. The knee moves front-and-back and can rotate slightly. As such, it is a pivotal hinge joint.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="hinge_ellipsoid" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Hinge is correct but elliptical is not. The knee joint does seem like an ellipical joint since it seems non-symmetric, but anatomically it is not.</feedback>
                </response>
                <hint>Think about the types of joints which only go in one direction.</hint>
