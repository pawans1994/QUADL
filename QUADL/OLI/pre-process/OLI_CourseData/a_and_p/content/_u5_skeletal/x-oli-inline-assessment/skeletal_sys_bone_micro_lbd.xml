Osteons will add a lot of strength but they make the bone very brittle and do not handle bending pressure as well as the trabeculae.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The trabeculae are like beams in concrete. They add strength and allow for some flexibility, allowing bone to withstand stresses from different directions.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Compact bone is composed of osteons which add strength but make the bone brittle.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Spongy bone contains trabeculae which provides more flexibility and strength to bone. Decreasing this type of bone would make bone more likely to break when bent.</feedback></response><hint>Osteons make the bones stronger and more brittle, so they break more easily when bent.</hint><hint>Trabeculae are found in Spongy bone, Osteons are found in compact bone.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
