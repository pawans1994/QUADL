In children the bones are still being ossified. The cartilage template is not strong enough to bear the childâ€™s weight without being ossified properly. The results is rickets in children and includes symptoms such as bowed legs. In adults the cartilage template has already been ossified, so osteomalacia will not occur in the form of rickets. However, adult bones are constantly being remodeled and if there is a lack of calcium the bones can become brittle and painful.</explanation></part></question></page></assessment>
