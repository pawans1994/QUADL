However, by themselves, these minerals can make the bones brittle. These crystals can be embedded within the macromolecules, mainly collagen, which add flexibility to the bone. The cellular level of bone includes osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes, which build bone, resorb bone and sense forces, respectively. Together the minerals, macromolecules and cells for a tissue that provides structural integrity, responds to its surroundings, and stores minerals.</explanation></part></question></page></assessment>
