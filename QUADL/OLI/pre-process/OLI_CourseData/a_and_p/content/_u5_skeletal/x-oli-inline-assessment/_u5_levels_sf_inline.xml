Moving does not necessarily alter the material like compression does.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Correct. Pushing the ends together compress a bone along its axis, which puts compressive force on it.</feedback></response><response match="a" score="1"><feedback>Incorrect. In fact, squeezing can lead to some degree of compression along the short axis of a bone, it produces a mainly tangiential stress of fibers. Therefore this is not the best answer. </feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This describes a rotational stress, which is more complex than a compressive stress</feedback></response><hint>Compression is a stress that alters (or potentially alters) the material, and is typically used to describe a stress along the long axis of a structure.</hint></part></question><question id="_u5_levels_sf_inline2"><body>Tension is to collagen as compression is to _____________.</body><multiple_choice shuffle="false"><choice value="a">hydroxyapatite</choice><choice value="b">extracellular matrix</choice><choice value="c">calcium</choice><choice value="d">phosphate</choice></multiple_choice><part id="_u5_levels_sf_inline2_p1"><skillref idref="skeletal_levels_mols_b_SKILL" /><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This answer is not specific enough as some components of the extracellular matrix resist tension, while others resist compression.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. TCalcium by itself does not resist compression.</feedback></response><response match="a" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Microscopic hydroxyapatite crystals are embedded in collagen and organized to give bone its resistance to compression.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Phosphate by itself does not resist compression.</feedback></response><hint>Consider the role of extracellular matrix components in resisting tension and compression.</hint></part></question><question id="_u5_levels_sf_inline3"><body>A deficiency in which of the following would lead to an increased probability of fracture:</body><multiple_choice shuffle="false"><choice value="a">hydroxyapatite</choice><choice value="b">calcium</choice><choice value="c">collagen</choice><choice value="d">all of the above</choice></multiple_choice><part id="_u5_levels_sf_inline3_p1"><skillref idref="skeletal_levels_mols_b_SKILL" /><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.

Although true, this is not the best answer to this question</feedback></response><response match="d" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Defects in any aspect of the microscopic structure of bone can lead to decreased strength and increased risk of factures.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.
