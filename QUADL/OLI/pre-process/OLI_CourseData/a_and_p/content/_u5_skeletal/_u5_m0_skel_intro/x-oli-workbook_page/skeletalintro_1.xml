		<p>Did you know that there are approximately 206 bones in an adult body? The smallest bones
			are in your middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes) and the largest bone is in the thigh
			(femur). These bones form the bulk of the skeletal system and have many important
			functions. They are critical for maintaining our structure and body shape. Skeletal
			muscles insert on bones and pull them for movement. Bones protect vital organs such as
			the brain, heart and lungs. Bones are also a reservoir for calcium. Excess calcium is
			put into bones for storage and if blood calcium levels fall, calcium is removed from the
			bones. As discussed in the homeostasis unit, parathyroid hormone is mainly responsible
			for regulating calcium exchange between blood and bone.</p>
		<p>Bones are living tissues formed from cells, proteins (mainly collagen), and minerals
			(calcium and phosphate). The skeletal system consists of bones, but also cartilage and
			ligaments. Bones will grow longitudinally (lengthwise) until approximately ages 18 (for women) and 21 (for
			men), after that people generally wonâ€™t get any taller. But bone tissue is active and becomes
			stronger when stress is placed on it. Exercise stimulates a type of bone growth that causes thickening of the bones (appositional growth), which makes bones stronger. If you are a couch potato, your bones actually become
			weaker!</p>
