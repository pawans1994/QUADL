We also partnered with <link href="http://www.wordsandnumbers.com/" target="new" internal="false">Words &amp; Numbers</link>, through <link href="http://cnx.org/" target="new" internal="false">Connexions<sup>Â®</sup></link> for some of the content for this course. </p><p id="ed81feb86ac946ee9e7cf42ef3eb6555">The course is centered on the learning outcomes developed by the Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology Society (HAPS) Curriculum and Instruction Committee, and can be used independently by students or by faculty as a course supplement. The project attempts to meet the needs at the learner, instructor, and institutional levels by providing the student with individualized learning support, the faculty with customized teaching support, and the community college with assessment support.</p><p id="bce3b9cad945442ea0b2381fdca77d98">Aside from providing continuous practice opportunities to the students, the assessments and activities throughout the course are used to collect real-time, interaction-level data about how and what students are learning and use this data to drive positive feedback loops to students, instructors, course design teams, institutions, and learning science researchers.</p></body></workbook_page>
