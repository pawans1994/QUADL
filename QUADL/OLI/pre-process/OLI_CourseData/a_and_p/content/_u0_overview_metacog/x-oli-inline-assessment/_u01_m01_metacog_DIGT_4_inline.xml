            <body>Rudolfo anticipates a very busy semester, so he completes his entire C@CM course
                by the second week of the semester, passing each unit review test easily. While this
                frees up his time for other courses, he finds that when he goes to take the final
                exam five weeks later, he has forgotten a lot of what he learned. Rudolfo failed to

                    <feedback>Incorrect. Rudolfo successfully completed the work, so apparently he
                        assessed the task accurately. It was his plan to complete the work too far
                        in advance of the final exam that proved ineffective.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Correct. This could be one explanation, if Rudolfo overestimated his
                        ability to remember material he had studied weeks earlier. However, it was
                        primarily his plan to complete the work so far in advance of the final exam
                        that proved ineffective. </feedback>

                <response match="C" score="1">
                    <feedback>Correct. Rudolfo’s plan to complete the work so far in advance of the
                        final exam proved ineffective. Because he left five weeks between studying and
                        taking the final exam, the material was not fresh in his mind when he took
                        the final.</feedback>

                <response match="D" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. Rudolfo’s performance throughout the course was fine, so
                        monitoring his performance was not his problem. It was his plan to complete
                        the work too far in advance of the final exam that proved ineffective.

                    <feedback>Incorrect. By the time Rudolfo realized his approach was unsuccessful,
                        it was too late to adjust. This was because his plan to complete the work
                        too far in advance of the final exam proved ineffective.</feedback>

            <body>Penelope has worked her way through the entire C@CM course by skipping the text
                and jumping straight to the activities, which she enjoys. When she doesn’t get an
                answer right on one of the activities, she just tries other answers until she
                discovers the correct one. Unfortunately, she does not pass the final exam the first
                time it’s offered, and thus has to learn the material all over again in time for the
                next final exam date. “Oh well,” she sighs: “Back to the drawing board.” Once again,
                she opens the first unit, skips the text, and goes straight to the activities.

                    <feedback>Incorrect. From the story, we can’t really know whether Penelope
                        assessed the task inaccurately. What we do know is that she neither learned
                        from her experience nor adjusted her approach for the next time.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. This is possible, but not the best answer. True, if
                        Penelope had accurately assessed her strengths and weaknesses the first time
                        she worked through the course, she would have realized that she could not
                        pass without reading the explanatory text. However, it was her failure to

                <response match="C" score="0">
                    <feedback>Incorrect. This is true, but not the best answer. Penelope did not
                        plan an effective strategy for working through C@CM the first time. However,
                        an even bigger mistake was not reflecting on and adjusting her approach
                        after it failed.</feedback>

                    <feedback>Incorrect. While Penelope clearly did not monitor her performance
                        closely enough to know her initial approach to studying was not effective,
                        her bigger mistake was to employ the same approach the second time around.

                <response match="E" score="1">
                    <feedback>Correct. This is the best answer: Penelope is employing the same
                        unsuccessful approach the second time she takes the course, without learning
                        from her mistakes the first time.</feedback>

                    her past approach to this unit and find a more effective way to go through the

                all the activities, and completing the unit quiz. After acing the final exam, he
                complains to one of his friends: “I knew all that Responsible Computing stuff to

                        Responsible Computing unit objectives before beginning. What we do know is
                        that he missed the opportunity to assess his own abilities in relation to
                        those objectives. If he had done the pre-assessments and scored well, he
                        would have realized that he didn’t need to read the text or do the
                        exercises, and he could have saved time by skipping to the Exam-readiness Quiz

                    <feedback>Incorrect. While Trevor may not have planned an efficient strategy, he
                        lacked some key information to do so. If he had taken the pre-assessments –
                        and realized that he didn’t need to read the text or do the exercises – he
                        could have skipped ahead to the Exam-readiness Quiz and saved himself some

                    <feedback>Incorrect. If Trevor had monitored his own performance better, he
                        might have realized that the material was too easy for him and skipped
                        ahead. However, doing the pre-assessments would have told him that up front,
                        saving even more time.</feedback>

                        strategy for one unit may not be the best strategy for another unit. Thus,
                        Trevor would have had trouble adjusting his approach without evaluating his
