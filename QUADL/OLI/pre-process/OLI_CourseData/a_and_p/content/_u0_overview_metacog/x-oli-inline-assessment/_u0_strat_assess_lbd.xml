            <body>Joe has just started the Skeletal System unit. He wants to get through it as quickly as possible while still making sure he is prepared to do well on the Quiz in two weeks. He sees a bunch of text with some activities sprinkled throughout, and is trying to decide how to proceed. 
Indicate whether each of the following would likely be an effective and efficient strategy for Joe:

Jump straight to the activities without reading the text. For each activity, select different answer choices to see if theyâ€™re right or wrong and read the feedback that appears.</body>
            <multiple_choice id="qsub_0" shuffle="true">
                <choice value="A">Yes</choice>
                <choice value="B">No</choice>
            </multiple_choice>
            <part id="qpart_0">
                <response match="A" score="0">
                    <feedback>That is not quite right. Learning by doing can be a good idea. However, Joe should keep in mind that the feedback for correct and incorrect answers is not as complete as the preceding text, so he might be missing important information.</feedback>
                </response>
                <response match="B" score="10">
                    <feedback>Good job! Learning by doing can be a good idea. However, Joe should keep in mind that the feedback for correct and incorrect answers is not as complete as the preceding text, so he might be missing important information.</feedback>
                </response>
                <hint>Think about which of these different strategies will be most likely to give Joe (a) all the information he needs for the final exam and (b) opportunities to practice applying the information and checking his understanding.</hint>

                    <feedback>Good job! If Joe has some previous experience with psychology, this may be the most efficient and effective strategy for him. The good thing about this strategy is that Joe uses the activities as a way to assess his own capabilities and then adjusts his approach accordingly. Moreover, by deciding to go back to read the preceding text, Joe is giving himself a chance to practice independent learning.</feedback>
