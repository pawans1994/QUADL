		<p>The <term>hypodermis</term> (also called the subcutis or <term>subcutaneous layer</term>)
			functions to connect the integument (epidermis and dermis) to the underlying muscles and
			organs. The hypodermis is not considered part of the
			skin<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121125T195159-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
			but has several important functions. Like the dermis, the hypodermis is made up of
			areolar tissue, collagen, and elastic
			fibers<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121125T195218-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
			providing it
			<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121125T195223-0500"?>with
			<?oxy_insert_end?>some elasticity. Additionally, it contains <term>adipose
			tissue</term>, which functions as a mode of fat storage. The hypodermis is vascular and
			contains arteries, veins, and blood capillaries.</p>

			fat, which serves as an energy reserve, insulates the body, and prevents heat loss. The
			fat distribution changes as our bodies mature and age.

The women in my family, as well as many other women I&apos;ve seen, gain weight in the stomach and lower back, and not the buttocks and thighs, so to me, this sounds like a blanket statement that does not apply to anywhere near a large majority of the population (though it might apply to a simple majority)."?>It

			accumulation of fat provided an evolutionary advantage to our ancestors, who experienced
			unpredictable bouts of famine, it is now considered a major health threat. Improved diet
			and increased exercise are the best ways to control body fat accumulation, especially
			when it gets to levels that increase the risk of heart disease.</p>
