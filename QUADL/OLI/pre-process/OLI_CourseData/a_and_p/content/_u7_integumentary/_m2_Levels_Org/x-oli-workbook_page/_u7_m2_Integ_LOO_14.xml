		<p id="b069e86fa7994cb2aeeaffa3ce16b290">Accessory structures of the skin include hair, nails, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. Although these structures appear to be part of the dermis, they are actually derived from the epidermis. The hair shaft is made of dead, keratinized cells and gets its color from melanin pigments. Nails are also keratinized and protect the extremities of our fingers and toes from mechanical damage. Sweat glands and sebaceous glands produce sweat and sebum, respectively. Each of these fluids has a role to play in maintaining homeostasis. Sweat helps the body remove excess fluids and electrolyte wastes and also cools down the body surface when it gets overheated. Sebum acts as a natural moisturizer of the dead, flaky outer keratin layer of skin and hair. Sebum is also known for its microbicidal and microbiostatic properties.</p>
