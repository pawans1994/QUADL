The <term>nail body</term> is formed on the <term>nail bed</term>, and it is designed to protect the tips of our fingers and toes, as they are the farthest extremities and the parts of the body that experience the maximum mechanical stress. The epidermis in this part of the body has evolved a specialized structure upon which nails can form. The nail body forms at the <term>nail root</term>. Lateral <term>nail folds</term>, folds of skin that overlap the nail on its side, help anchor the nail body. The nail fold that meets the proximal end of the nail body forms the <term>nail cuticle</term>, also called the eponychium. The nail bed is rich in blood vessels, making it appear pink, except at the base, where there is a crescent-shaped region called the <term>lunula</term>. The nail body is composed of keratin-rich, densely packed dead keratinocytes. The area beneath the free edge of the nail, where debris gets lodged, is called the <term>hyponychium</term>.</p><wb:inline idref="nail_structure" purpose="learnbydoing" /><wb:inline idref="nail_structure_digt" purpose="didigetthis" /></body></workbook_page>
