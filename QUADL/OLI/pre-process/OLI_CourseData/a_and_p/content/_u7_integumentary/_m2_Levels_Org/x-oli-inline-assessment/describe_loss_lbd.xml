Male pattern baldness is carried on the X chromosome so a male would have to get it from his mother.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. A woman cannot inherit a gene on the Y chromosome because women do not have a Y chromosome.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Because women have two X chromosomes, they would need to have two copies of the recessive allele to exhibit the trait.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. A woman cannot inherit a gene on the Y chromosome because women do not have a Y chromosome; but she could inherit this disease if she gets an X chromosome with the gene from both her mother and her father.</feedback></response><hint>Men have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
