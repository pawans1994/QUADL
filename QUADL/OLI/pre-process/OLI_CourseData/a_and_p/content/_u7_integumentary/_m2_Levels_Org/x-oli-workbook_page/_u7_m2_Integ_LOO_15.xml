			surface is called the <term>hair shaft</term>, and the rest of the follicle is called
			the <term>hair root</term>. The bulge at the base of the hair root is called the
				<term>hair bulb</term>, which is made up of a layer of basal cells called the
				<term>hair matrix</term>. The hair matrix contains the cells that rapidly divide to
			form the hair. The hair bulb surrounds the <term>hair papilla</term> (made up of
			connective tissue, blood capillaries and nerve endings).</p>

		<p>Just as the layers of the skin form on the inner layers and get pushed out to the surface
			as the dead skin on the surface sheds, basal cells in the center of the hair bulb divide
			to form layers of keratinocytes that form the <term>medulla</term>, <term>cortex</term>,
			and <term>cuticle</term> of the hair bulb. These layers are visible in a longitudinal
			section of the hair follicle. Keratin formation starts in the cells of the medulla and the keratin
			continues to be produced in the cortex and cuticle. Keratinization is completed as the cells
			are pushed to the skin surface to form the shaft of hair that is externally visible. The
			external hair is composed entirely of keratin. </p>
		<p>Additionally, the hair follicle is made up of three concentric layers that make up the wall of
			the follicle
			<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T091358-0500"?>—<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T091357-0500" content="–"?>
			the <term>internal root sheath</term>, the <term>external root sheath</term>, and the
				<term>glassy membrane</term>. The cells of the internal root sheath are derived from
			the basal cells of the hair matrix. This layer does not surround the entire hair strand,
			but stops short at the base of the hair shaft. The external root sheath, which encloses
			the hair root, is made up of basal cells at the base of the hair root and tends to be
			more keratinous in the upper regions. The glassy membrane is a thick, clear connective
			tissue sheath covering the hair root and connecting it to the tissue of the dermis.</p>
		<p>Hair serves a variety of functions. For example, hair on the head protects it from the sun and
			<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T091710-0500"?>from
			<?oxy_insert_end?>heat loss; and hair in the nose and ears and around the eyes
			(eyelashes)
			defend<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T091723-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>
			the body by trapping dust particles that may contain allergens and microbes. Hair on the
			eyebrows prevents sweat and other particles from bothering the eyes. Hair also has a
			sensory function due to innervation of the hair papilla. Hair is extremely sensitive to
			changes in the environment, much more so than the skin surface. The hair root is
			connected to smooth muscles called <term>arrector pili</term> that contract in response
			to stimuli, making the external hair shaft “stand up.” This is visible in humans as
			goose bumps and even more obvious in animals, such as when a frightened cat’s fur puffs
			out. In many
			animals<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T092109-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
			the puffing out
			<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T092119-0500"?>makes the

			scare off a predator. Another advantage of this ability to cause the hair to stand up is
			that it can trap air and can act as an
			insulator<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T092220-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>

		<p>Hairs grow during a
			<?oxy_comment_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T092432-0500" comment="Should the phase names (anagen, catagen, telogen) be highlighted?"?>phase

			and <?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T092314-0500"?>they
			<?oxy_insert_end?>are eventually shed, only to be replaced by newer ones. When hair is
			naturally ready to be shed, the follicle becomes inactive during a phase called catagen.
			The follicle then becomes smaller, and becomes detached from the dermal papilla at the
			base<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T092335-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
			during the phase called telogen. The basal cells in the hair matrix then produce a new
			hair follicle during anagen. Hair typically grows at the rate of 0.3<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T092452-0500"?>
			<?oxy_insert_end?>mm per day and can continue growing for

			before being shed. About 50 hairs may be lost and replaced per day. Hair loss occurs if

		<p>Just like the skin, hair gets its color from the pigment melanin, produced by melanocytes
			in the hair matrix. Different hair color results from differences in the type of
			melanin, which is genetically determined. As a person ages, the melanin production
			decreases and hair tends to lose its color, becoming gray and/or white.</p>

			<title>Alopecia</title>
			<p>Many individuals can experience hair thinning and/or loss with advanced age. This is called
				alopecia. This can lead to complete hair
				loss<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T093149-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
				called baldness. Most baldness is caused by a genetic sensitivity of hair follicles
				to the androgen hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT causes the hair follicle to
				receive less blood
				flow<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T093236-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
				so that the hair follicle begins to atrophy and any hair that is produced is
				thin.</p>
			<p>A common form of baldness is male pattern
				baldness<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T093247-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
				which results from a mutation on the X chromosome. It is seen more often in men
				because men only receive one copy of the X chromosome. Many women may be carriers of
				this trait, having one normal X
				<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T093321-0500"?>chromosome
				<?oxy_insert_end?>and one X
				<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T093326-0500"?>chromosome
				<?oxy_insert_end?>that has the male pattern baldness gene.
				<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T093348-0500"?>Women<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T093350-0500" content="They"?>
				usually do not exhibit the balding patterns seen in men.</p>
