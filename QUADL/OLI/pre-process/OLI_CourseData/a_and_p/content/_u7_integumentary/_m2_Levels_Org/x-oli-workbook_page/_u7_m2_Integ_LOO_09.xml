		<p>The skin is composed of several layers of keratinocytes at the surface (the epidermis).
			The most superficial layer is dead and sheds periodically. It is progressively replaced by stem
			cells which divide in the basal layer (stratum basale). The dermis connects the
			epidermis to the hypodermis and provides strength and elasticity due to the presence of
			collagen and elastin fibers. The hypodermis is the name for the layer of connective
			tissue that connects the dermis to the underlying organs. It also harbors adipose tissue
			for fat storage and insulation.</p>
