		<p>The integumentary system is one of the main protective systems of the human body. It’s
			not a commonly known system. It contains your skin, hair, nails, and several glands. Did
			you know your skin is the largest organ in your body? It makes up approximately 7% of
			your body weight! The skin is also known as your integument or covering. Have you ever
			heard the expression that “beauty is only skin deep”? It’s an interesting statement
			because everything you see on another person’s appearance is dead! The layer of skin and
			hairs that are visible are actually dead epithelial cells!</p>
		<p>The skin is actually formed from two layers: the superficial epidermis layer which is
			composed of epithelial tissue and the deeper connective tissue layer known as the dermis. The hypodermis is below the dermis and composed of loose connective tissue.
			When you give a subcutaneous (or sub-Q) injection you inject the drug into the
			hypodermis layer. Subcutaneous means below the cutaneous membrane which is another term
			for your skin. One medication commonly given via this method is insulin.
