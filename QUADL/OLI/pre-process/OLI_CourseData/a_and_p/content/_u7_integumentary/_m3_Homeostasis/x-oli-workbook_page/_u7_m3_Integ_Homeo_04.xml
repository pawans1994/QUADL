		<p>The integumentary system regulates body temperature through several different means. Recall

			—<?oxy_insert_end?> excrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when it

			perspiration.<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T175704-0500"?>"<?oxy_insert_end?>
			Even if the body does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of
			sweat are secreted a day. If the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures,
			vigorous activity, or a combination of the two, the blood vessels in the integumentary
			system dilate and sweat glands produce large amounts of sweat<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121126T175828-0500"?>

		<p>When temperatures are cold, the adipose tissue of the hypodermis helps insulate the body.

			and the arrector pili muscles help to insulate by trapping air on the surface of the
			skin. Additionally, the dermal blood vessels constrict to decrease blood flow (and heat
			loss) at the skin.</p>
