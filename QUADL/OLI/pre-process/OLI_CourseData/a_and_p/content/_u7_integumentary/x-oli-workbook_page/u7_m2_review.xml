        <p>The most superficial layer of the skin is the epidermis, which is composed of stratified squamous epithelia that are keratinized at the 
            outermost surface, melanocytes, immune cells (Langerhans that modulate immune response) and sensory receptors (Merkel cells that detect 
            light touch). The function of the epidermis layer is "protection."</p>
        
        <p>The dermis lies beneath the epidermis and is composed of two layers of connective tissue: a loose layer (papillary) and a dense irregular
            layer (reticular). Both layers of the dermis contain connective tissue components (collagen, elastin, fibroblasts), plus blood vessels, 
            sensory receptors and lymphatics. The dermis is a "functional" layer.</p>
        
        <p>Beneath these two layers lies the hypodermis, composed of loose connective tissue (adipose and areolar). The hypodermis is the "connection" layer.
            It connects the integument (epidermis and dermis) to organs and muscles in the body. </p>
