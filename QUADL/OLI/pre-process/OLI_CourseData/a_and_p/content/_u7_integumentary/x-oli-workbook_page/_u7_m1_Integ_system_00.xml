        <p>Every time you look in the mirror, you get a glimpse at one of the body’s most essential
            and dynamic systems: the integumentary system. The integumentary system refers to the
            skin and its accessory structures, and it is responsible for much more than simply
            lending you your outward appearance. In the adult human body, the skin makes up about 16
            percent of the body weight and covers an area of 1.5–2 m<sup>2</sup>. In fact, the skin
            and accessory structures are the largest organ system in human anatomy. While we do not
            typically think of the skin as an organ, it is made up of tissues that come together as
            a single structure to perform unique and critical functions. This chapter will introduce
            you to the structure and functions of the integumentary system, as well as describe
            diseases, disorders, and injuries that can affect integumentary system.</p>
