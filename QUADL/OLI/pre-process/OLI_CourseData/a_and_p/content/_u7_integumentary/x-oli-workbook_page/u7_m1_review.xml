        <title>Integumentary System Introduction Review and Assessment </title>

        <p>The integumentary system is one of the main protective systems of the human body. It contains your skin, hair, nails, and several glands.
            The skin is formed from two layers: the superficial epidermis layer which is composed of epithelial tissue and the deeper connective tissue
            layer known as the dermis. The hypodermis is below the dermis and composed of loose connective tissue.</p>
        
        <p>The integumentary system is vital for our body’s homeostasis, as the skin is an important barrier for protection. The integumentary 
            system is also crucial for body temperature regulation. When we are too warm, blood vessels going to the skin open up (vasodilate) 
            and more blood flows to the surface of the skin to release heat to cool the body. Our skin is also tied into our nervous system. 
            One of our main senses – touch is dependent on numerous receptors located in our skin. We can feel and process information regarding 
            pressure, temperature, light touch, and pain through our skin.</p>
