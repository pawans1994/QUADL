Such foreign antigens may be viral proteins produced after a virus infects the cell, toxins produced from intracellular bacteria, or abnormal proteins synthesized by a cancerous cell. When a peptide fragment comes from a self-protein, T cells ignore the <input_ref input="two" />/epitope complex. However, if the peptide fragment comes from a foreign protein, T cells recognize the MHC-I/epitope complex and an immune response occurs.</p></body><fill_in_the_blank id="one" shuffle="true"><choice value="a">exogenous</choice><choice value="b">endogenous</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank id="two" shuffle="true"><choice value="a">MHC class I</choice><choice value="b">MHC class II</choice></fill_in_the_blank><part id="q1_p1"><skillref idref="lymph_CMIR_SKILL" /><response input="one" match="b" score="1"><feedback>Correct.
