It is true APCs can engulf and digest antigens but another answer may be more complete and therefore more correct.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Partially correct. It is true that APCs can process and present antigen with MHC class II, but another answer may be more complete and therefore more correct.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Partially correct. It is true that APCs can present antigen with MHC class II and migrate to lymphtic tissue to present the antigen to helper T cells, but another answer may be more complete and therefore more correct.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Partially correct. It is true that these cells are all can function as antigen presenting cells, but another answer may be more complete and therefore more correct.</feedback></response><response match="E" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Antigen presenting cells participate in the immune response in many ways.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
