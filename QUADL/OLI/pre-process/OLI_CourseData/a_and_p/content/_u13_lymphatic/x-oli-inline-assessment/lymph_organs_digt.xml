Lymph nodes and the spleen both are encapsulated and are more highly organized, but there are two significant differences between them. What are they?</body><multiple_choice select="single" shuffle="true"><choice value="A">The spleen has red and white pulp and is fed only by the lymph vessels.</choice><choice value="B">Because lymph nodes have one-way lymph flow they cannot filter the fluid, so they do not have an immune function.</choice><choice value="C">The lymph node has white cells while the spleen has red and white pulp; and the lymph node filters lymph while the spleen filters blood.</choice><choice value="D">The lymph node and spleen have contrasting immune functions, and only the spleen filters lymph.</choice></multiple_choice><part id="q1_p1"><skillref idref="lymph_organs_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.

Both organs provide immune and filtering functions, but one filters lymph and the other filters blood.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.
