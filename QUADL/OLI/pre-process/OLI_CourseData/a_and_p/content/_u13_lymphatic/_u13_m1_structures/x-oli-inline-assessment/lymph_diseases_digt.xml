Which pairing with disease and mechanisms is correct?</p></body><multiple_choice shuffle="true" select="single" id="b6e4535c227d42b5926a488e1f01e9d9" labels="false"><choice value="A">Diabetes results from immune cells no longer making insulin</choice><choice value="B">Allergic reactions happen when the cells of the immune system respond to normal environmental elements</choice><choice value="C">HIV infection causes the immune cells to make too much antibody</choice><choice value="D">Autoimmune diseases happen when T cells divide too rapidly</choice></multiple_choice><part id="q1_p1"><skillref idref="lymph_diseases_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback><p id="af85bb989db2744e9a34310bcf3e14d08">Diabetes occurs when the cells of the immune system attack the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin.</p></feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback><p id="ac15f9ea294aa4e95aa45798e02cbc780">Allergic reaction occurs when someone responds to something in the environment that should not stimulate a reaction normally</p></feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback><p id="aa99331699a2d4c3688fd7ed3b8b4809f">Incorrect.

It often becomes a downward spiralling circle. The autoimmune attack on the joint leads to degradation of the joint. Degradation of the joint stimulates the immune system even more so there is a further attack on the joint. What approach might be the best for getting this process under control?</p></body><multiple_choice shuffle="true" select="single" id="fc93bff2d32b44ae848bac479348d590" labels="false"><choice value="A">Give the patient antibiotics</choice><choice value="B">Look for a suitable donor to do a bone marrow transplant</choice><choice value="C">Give the patient antihistamines</choice><choice value="D">Give the patient some drugs which would temporarily reduce the activity of their immune cells.</choice></multiple_choice><part id="q2_p1"><skillref idref="lymph_diseases_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback><p id="af07bd5158ee24c6abebbd8644ea8521c">.
