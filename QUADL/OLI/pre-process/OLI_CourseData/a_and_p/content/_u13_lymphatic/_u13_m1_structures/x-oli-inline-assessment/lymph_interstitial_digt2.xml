The ground becomes saturated so water and some minerals leach out of the ground and collect in puddles. This would be analogous to <input_ref input="one" /> accumulating outside of the circulatory system and into the tissues. When this happens we often refer to the area with accumulated fluid as being <input_ref input="two" />. Eventually this excess fluid finds its way to the <input_ref input="three" />, which are pretty leaky and don’t really filter the fluid, much the same way a small stream will accumulate the run-off water after the rain. The fluid inside the lymph capillary is now called <input_ref input="four" /> and is pale yellow in color. The lymph fluid is propelled through the capillary when drains into larger lymph <input_ref input="five" /> much the same way a small stream empties into a larger creek. The larger creek usually empties into a river. In the case of this analogy the larger lymph <input_ref input="six" /> run parallel to the blood vessel. The lymph in the large vessels drains into the larger <input_ref input="seven" /> near the heart in the chest. Like a river with a beaver dam, along the way the lymph vessels while drain into <input_ref input="eight" /> which remove some of the debris and foreign matter found circulating in the lymph slowing down the fluid flow and allowing the cells of the immune system to do their job. </p></body><fill_in_the_blank id="one" shuffle="true"><choice value="a">blood serum</choice><choice value="b">interstitial fluid</choice><choice value="c">water</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank id="two" shuffle="true"><choice value="a">overhydrated</choice><choice value="b">squishy</choice><choice value="c">edematous</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank id="three" shuffle="true"><choice value="a">lymph capillaries</choice><choice value="b">arterioles</choice><choice value="c">kidney tubules</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank id="four" shuffle="true"><choice value="a">interstitial fluid</choice><choice value="b">water</choice><choice value="c">lymph</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank id="five" shuffle="true"><choice value="a">nodes</choice><choice value="b">vessel</choice><choice value="c">spleen</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank id="six" shuffle="true"><choice value="a">ducts</choice><choice value="b">nodes</choice><choice value="c">organs</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank id="seven" shuffle="true"><choice value="a">venous vessels</choice><choice value="b">arteries</choice><choice value="c">aorta</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank id="eight" shuffle="true"><choice value="a">kidney nephrons</choice><choice value="b">blood capillaries</choice><choice value="c">lymph nodes</choice></fill_in_the_blank><part id="q1_p1"><skillref idref="lymph_adaptive_SKILL" /><response input="one" match="a" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. When fluid leaves the capillary it is usually a bulk flow mechanism meaning that content of the fluid doesn’t appreciably change.</feedback></response><response input="one" match="b" score="1"><feedback>Correct. The space between cells is referred to as interstitial.</feedback></response><response input="one" match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Water is the largest single component but not the only component.</feedback></response></part><part id="q1_p2"><skillref idref="lymph_adaptive_SKILL" /><response input="two" match="a" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is a normal process and does not require overhydration.</feedback></response><response input="two" match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The tissue may feel squishy but that is not the correct term.</feedback></response><response input="two" match="c" score="1"><feedback>Correct. This is the term for tissue which has accumulated excess fluid.</feedback></response></part><part id="q1_p3"><skillref idref="lymph_adaptive_SKILL" /><response input="three" match="a" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Although confusing the smallest conduit of lymph is also termed a capillary.</feedback></response><response input="three" match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Arterioles are part of the blood distribution system leaving the heart.</feedback></response><response input="three" match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Kidney tubules filter blood, not lymph.</feedback></response></part><part id="q1_p4"><skillref idref="lymph_adaptive_SKILL" /><response input="four" match="a" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is the term for fluid in the tissues.</feedback></response><response input="four" match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. There is more to this liquid than water; it also contains proteins, electrolytes and other molecules.</feedback></response><response input="four" match="c" score="1"><feedback>Correct. The fluid inside a lymph vessel is referred to as lymph.</feedback></response></part><part id="q1_p5"><skillref idref="lymph_adaptive_SKILL" /><response input="five" match="a" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Lymph nodes are scattered along the paths of the lymph vessels but they are not the main recipient of fluid.</feedback></response><response input="five" match="b" score="1"><feedback>Correct.

The kidneys filter blood.</feedback></response><response input="eight" match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The blood capillaries carry blood.</feedback></response><response input="eight" match="c" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Transit time is high in the lymph nodes which facilitates debris removal and activity by immune cells.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
