B cells make antibodies that respond to a molecule, usually a protein found on the surface of a foreign invader.</p></feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback><p id="ac327b109f1d6458a95e8731ebd7eb8f3">Incorrect. T helper cells interact with other cells of the immune system to stimulate an adaptive immune response. They circulate freely within the entire body.</p></feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback><p id="ada3fb58306614f5d9fd8f1899f949c69">Incorrect. Cytotoxic T cells are capable of directly attacking foreign invaders; they do not do “garbage removal.”</p></feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback><p id="aa91647ec507f41ba865711e544efafb6">Incorrect. Memory B cells respond by clonal expansion followed by antibody production. T cells do not make antibodies.</p></feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
