Antigen is the general term for something which stimulates the immune system.</feedback></response><response input="antigens" match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Antibodies are the proteins made by your body in response to unknown antigen.</feedback></response></part><part id="q1_p2"><skillref idref="lymph_molecule_SKILL" /><skillref idref="lymph_antigens_SKILL" /><response input="activated" match="a" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Antibodies and T cells are designed to recognize a small segment of a protein. This small segment could be repeated in related proteins therefore broadening the response. This is why some people are allergic to related groups of plants. </feedback></response><response input="activated" match="b" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Many antigenic molecules are large complex molecules and it would be physically prohibitive for an antibody or T cell to bind the entire molecule.</feedback></response></part><part id="q1_p3"><skillref idref="lymph_molecule_SKILL" /><skillref idref="lymph_antigens_SKILL" /><response input="holes" match="b" score="1"><feedback>Correct.

Since antibodies and immune cells only recognize a small section of an antigen it makes sense that some antigens would have many segments that had the potential to stimulate the immune system. </feedback></response><response input="ecf" match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Most proteins are large and complex so it makes sense that there could be multiple sites that stimulate the immune reponse.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
