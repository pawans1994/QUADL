Opsonization does not require proteins from the damaged cell.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Leukotrienes are correct, but their secretion results in chemotaxis and increased adherence.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Activiated complement stimulates chemotaxis and can lead to opsonization.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="10"><feedback>Correct. There are many chemotactic signals and damaged tissue is one of them.</feedback></response><response match="E" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Microbes do not secrete chemical signals to which the immune system responds.</feedback></response><response match="F" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Damaged tissue cells are the signals for phagocytes, but they do not attack normal tissues.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
