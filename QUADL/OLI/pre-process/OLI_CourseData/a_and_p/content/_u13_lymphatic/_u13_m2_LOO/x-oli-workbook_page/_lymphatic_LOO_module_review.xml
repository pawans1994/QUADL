        <p>Before taking the quiz below, consider again the learning objectives for this module.
            Could you demonstrate each of these objectives? If so, you will be ready for the
            assessment below. If not, consider reviewing content related to these objectives before
            attempting the assessment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrate the levels of organization in the lymphatic system and their functional
                interconnections.</li>
            <li>Describe the basic structure and function of chemical molecules of the lymphatic
                system and correlate it to the overall functions of lymphatic system.</li>
            <li>Explain how interferons, complement and tranferrins function as antimicrobial
                chemicals.</li>
            <li>Describe how histamine, kinins, prostaglandins, leukotrienes and complement
                contribute to flammation.</li>
            <li>Define and describe location of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and
                their receptors (PRRs). </li>
            <li>Define and describe location of antigens and antigen receptors. Discuss the source
                of antigen receptor diversity. </li>
            <li>Define and describe location of major histocompatibility complex (MHC). </li>
            <li>Describe antibody structure, list the five classes of antibodies and functional
                features that distinguish each class.</li>
            <li>Define and describe the functional role of the important cytokines participating in
                the immune response.</li>
            <li>Define and describe the roles of various types of white blood cells in the innate
                and adaptive immune response and correlate them to the overall functions of the
                lymphatic system.</li>
            <li>Name the cells of the innate immune response and correlate their function to the
                overall functions of the innate immune response.</li>
            <li>Name the cells of the adaptive immune response and correlate their function to the
                overall functions of the adaptive immune response.</li>
            <li>Compare and contrast interstitial fluid and lymph. Describe the basic structure and
                cellular composition of lymphatic tissues and correlate them to the overall
                functions of the lymphatic system.</li>
            <li>Identify the lymphatic organs and correlate them to the overall functions of the of
                the lymphatic system. Identify and describe the gross anatomical and microscopic
                anatomy of each organ. Describe the location and function of each organ.</li>
            <li>Compare and contrast innate defenses with adaptive defenses. Analyze ways in which
                the innate and adaptive immunity cooperate to enhance the overall resistance to
                disease.</li>
            <li>Describe the types of defensive mechanisms of innate immunity such as barriers,
                phagocytosis, inflammation and fever.</li>
            <li>Name the barriers and describe their anatomic, chemical and microbiological
                mechanisms of defense.</li>
            <li>Describe the origin and roles of various white blood cells in innate immunity. </li>
            <li>Describe the steps involved in phagocytosis and give examples of phagocytic cells in
                the body. Describe the mechanisms of inflammation initiation. Summarize the cells
                and chemicals involved in the inflammatory process. List and explain the cause of
                the four cardinal signs of inflammation. Explain the benefits of inflammation. </li>
