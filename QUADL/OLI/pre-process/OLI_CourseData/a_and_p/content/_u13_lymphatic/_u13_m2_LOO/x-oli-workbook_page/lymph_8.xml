These cells are derived from a common precursor cell found in the red bone marrow called the hematopoietic stem cell. These pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells can divide and mature into one of a number of different types of cells. Therefore, they are termed pluripotent, or able to produce a broad variety of cells. This means that many different cells result from the same precursor cell. When cells divide, they mature into different cell types in a process called <term>differentiation</term>. As with all stem cells, the type of cells they differentiate into is controlled by signals in the environment where they reside. Hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into the red blood cells (erythrocytes), platelets and two categories of white blood cells (leukocytes), the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. These leukocytes participate in the immune response and further differentiate into mast-cells, granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils), monocytes (macrophages), dendritic cells and lymphocytes (natural killer cells, B-cells and T-cells)</p></body></workbook_page>
