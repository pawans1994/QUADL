The composition of electrolytes will be the same in both fluids.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. White blood cells are found in interstitial fluid and blood.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Lymph runs through the lymph ducts and interstitial fluid is found within the tissues.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Proteins found in the interstitial fluid may also be found in the lymph.</feedback></response><response match="E" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Red blood cells should only be present in the vessels of the cardiovascular system. Finding them in the lymph or interstitial fluid means there has been damage to the blood vessels.</feedback></response></part></question><question id="q2"><body>Lymph tissues serve two main function. They transport lymph and they house the cells that participate in the immune response.

This statement is true.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The spleen encounters only blood.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This statement is true. The MALT associated tissue are an important protection against antigens which we may ingest in our food.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Lymph immune tissues are generally quiescent unless stimulated by an antigen. The presence of germinal centers housing the appropriate stem cells allows for a rapid response.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
