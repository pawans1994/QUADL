Each lymphocyte has a receptor that recognizes only one epitope. This is like a lock and key system. The pathogen has a protein that is broken down into a protein fragment (peptide). This peptide is the epitope that acts like a <input_ref input="two" /> that only fits one lock. That lock is the <input_ref input="three" /> on the T or B cell. When the epitope is inserted into the matching receptor it initiates a series of events (turning the key) that causes the stimulated T or B cell to rapidly divide, producing many copies of itself. This process is termed <input_ref input="four" />.</p></body><fill_in_the_blank shuffle="true" id="one"><choice value="a">T and B</choice><choice value="b">G and M</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank shuffle="true" id="two"><choice value="a">gearshift</choice><choice value="b">key</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank shuffle="true" id="three"><choice value="a">receptor</choice><choice value="b">antigen</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank shuffle="true" id="four"><choice value="a">differentiation</choice><choice value="b">clonal expansion</choice></fill_in_the_blank><part id="q1_p1"><skillref idref="lymph_distinguish_SKILL" /><response match="a" score="1" input="one"><feedback><p id="aa0aa06ad78464aada8f25bab775fdb44">Correct.
