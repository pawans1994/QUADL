Which of the following mechanisms are ALL considered innate immunity?</p></body><multiple_choice shuffle="true" select="single" id="e2c16be6abff46288f7fee60b9886edd" labels="false"><choice value="A">Antibody production, fever, anatomical barriers, the inflammatory process</choice><choice value="B">Sequestering of pathogens, anatomical barriers, phagocytosis</choice><choice value="C">Fever, the inflammatory reaction, antibody production</choice><choice value="D">Inflammatory response, phagocytosis, fever</choice></multiple_choice><part id="q1_p1"><skillref idref="lymph_defenses_SKILL" /><skillref idref="lymph_innate_mechanisms_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback><p id="ac0bbd99168ad49f1afabc8b4837ab34e">Incorrect. Antibody production is part of the acquired immune response.</p></feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback><p id="ae8261a3dc0f94e60b09713d745a49db0">Incorrect. Pathogen sequestration may occur as part of either the innate or adaptive responses.</p></feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback><p id="ad7abef81e5314cf8b26206a3eb9c545e">Incorrect. Antibody production is an adaptive response.</p></feedback></response><response match="D" score="10"><feedback><p id="ad6f27714ee914e7f9992ce33f1e96011">Correct.

A low blood volume would impede movement of cells within the body but would not necessarily disrupt the innate immune response.</p></feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback><p id="ae73721d1130546a9bae1e2b2ed1b575e">Incorrect. Hypothermia would slow down many chemical reactions within the body, and the shivering would use up energy reserves, but the innate response would still function.</p></feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback><p id="ae6c03d75ec464c5ca70e683a1f500f3e">Incorrect. High blood glucose levels are damaging to many of the cells, tissues and organs in the body, but they would not have a specific impact on the innate immune responses.</p></feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
