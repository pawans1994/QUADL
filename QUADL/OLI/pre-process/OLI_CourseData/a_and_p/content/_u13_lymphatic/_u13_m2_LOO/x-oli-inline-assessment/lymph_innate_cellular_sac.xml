Entry through a cut in the skin allows for such access. When it enters, the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) found on the surface of the bacteria are recognized by the local immune cells. Mast cells begin to release chemicals to recruit other immune cells, then macrophages or neutrophils will phagocytize the bacteria and lyse it. The area of infection shows signs of infection. It will become hot, red, swollen, and become painful because of the influx of inflammatory cells.</explanation></part></question><question id="q2"><body>Why is it beneficial to have an innate immune response?</body><short_answer id="A" /><part id="q2_p1"><skillref idref="lymph_defenses_SKILL" /><skillref idref="lymph_innate_cellular_SKILL" /><response input="A" match="*" score="10" /><explanation>The innate immune response is very rapid. Signs of infection and inflammation are evident within minutes of exposure. The innate immune response will either prevent or diminish the potential damage that can result if a pathogen gained access to the body.</explanation></part></question></page></assessment>
