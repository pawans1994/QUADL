		<p>Take any anatomy and/or physiology textbook or course, and chances are that the chapter
			dedicated to the lymphatic system will be short and lacking detail when compared to its
			mighty and well known sibling, the cardiovascular system. Maybe because of the
			prominence and the romantic notions ascribed to the heart and blood, the cardiovascular
			system has been studied much more extensively. Since its original description by
			Hippocrates, the lymphatic system has been neglected by both scientific and medical
			communities because of its vagueness in structure and function. “Rediscovered” in the
			1600s as the venae albae et lacteae (“milky veins”), the lymphatic system was for long
			considered a secondary vascular system that supports the blood vascular system. </p>
		<p>In fact, the lymphatic system has important functions ranging from transport of fats,
			returning leaked fluids to the blood, to housing the cells and many organs of the immune
			response. </p>
