Magnesium, with its low electronegativity will tend to loose its 2 outer electrons, thus leaving an excess of protons. Positively charged ions are referred to as cations.</p></feedback></response><hint><p id="af6bf797ab3c54a10bcd16edae6a088dd">Magnesium has 12 electrons, so arrange them in orbital around nucleus with inner most orbital having maximum of 2, whereas subsequent orbitals hold maximum of 8 electrons</p></hint><hint><p id="aa1685c7cca9c4c7e981064e77288747b">How many electrons are in the outer most orbital, is easie to loose or gain electrons to obey the octet rule?</p></hint><hint><p id="ab3d3c60aca854b1d871c71988e3c933d">Magnesium has a low electronegativity thus it will be easier for it to lose electrons</p></hint><hint><p id="ba24bf56ba544812b74436d9a9fdbb15">Loss of electrons leads to an excess of positive charges.

Chlorine, with its high electronegativity will tend gain 1 electron, thus filling its outer orbital. This creates an excess of negative charges. A negatively charged ion is referred to as an anion.</p></feedback></response><response match="lost_cation" score="0"><feedback><p id="af1560e2efc574d92b86c66fbfad3c336">That is not quite right. Chlorine, having a high electronegativity will tend to gain electrons rather than loose them. Furthermore, gain of electrons leads to an excess of negative charges, forming a negatively charged ion called an anion, not an cation.</p></feedback></response><response match="lost_anion" score="0"><feedback><p id="ada2b770b45b64751ad209b132a1bd42e">That is not quite right.
