Serum is the portion of plasma that does not contain any blood-clotting proteins. Plasma consists of mainly water (90 percent). Other substances found in plasma include proteins, respiratory gases (O2 and CO2), electrolytes (sodium, chloride, calcium, and bicarbonate), nutrients, and waste products (e.g., urea and uric acid). The most abundant of the proteins is albumin, which helps retain water in the vascular compartment. The function of plasma is to transport dissolved nutrients and gases, regulate pH, and contribute to fluid and electrolyte balance. Make sure you understand the various plasma proteins and their functions. </p><p id="c33e891b255c461284b73fcf9e097015">is a protective process in which the body undergoes a cascade of steps in order to stop the bleeding from a damaged blood vessel.There are three main types of blood cells that flow through the blood stream, with each type serving specialized functions. Red blood cells primarily carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, white blood cells are immune cells that patrol the blood and body tissues for pathogens and platelets, are involved in hemostasis. Hematopoiesis, or the formation of blood cells, occurs in the red bone marrow of the body. </p><p id="febfce97e9d5472290090530f2f6e3bf">There are three types of cells that comprise the myocardium: the pacemaker, the conducting, and the myocardial cells. The pacemaker cells, also called the nodal cells, are the cells found within the sinoatrial (SA) and the atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Specialized conducting cells carry the action potentials at a high rate from the SA to the AV node, and then from the AV node to the rest of the ventricular cells. </p><activity idref="_u9_cardio_levels_of_org_quiz" purpose="quiz" /></body></workbook_page>
