        <p>Cardiac output is homeostatically maintained throughout our lifetime so that it constantly meets the needs of the bodyâ€™s tissues. 
            When the heart becomes damaged, such as after a heart attack, it may not be able to maintain adequate flow. This causes blood 
            pressure to fall, initiating homeostatic feedback loops to try to bring blood pressure (and cardiac output) back to normal.
            Autoregulation refers to a tissue's ability to meet its metabolic needs by automatically altering its blood flow. Autoregulation
            is particularly important in organs such as the heart and skeletal muscles, whose need for oxygen, nutrients, and the removal
            of wastes during exercise can be up to 10 times higher than when the body is at rest. </p>
