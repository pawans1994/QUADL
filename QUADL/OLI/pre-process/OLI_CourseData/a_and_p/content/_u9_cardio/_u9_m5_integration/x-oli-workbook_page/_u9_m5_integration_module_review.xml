Instead, flow is directed to those tissues that need it most, typically based on their metabolic state. If you are sprinting, your cardiac output might triple, but the flow to the muscles in your legs might go up six or eight fold, while flow to your digestive organs can actually decrease. Both the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) alter the cardiac output as necessary. The ANS modulates the heart rate and force of contraction (contractility) of the myocardium. </p><p id="b8c509425be646dfa0fab1599238dd0a">A number of hormones are involved in the regulation of blood flow and BP. They work by changing cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or total blood volume. Make sure you understand the mechanisms of these hormones, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ADH, and ANP, amongst others. </p><p id="f9aad5a1310940a48d0645db33abc9f0">Before taking the quiz below, consider again the learning objectives for this module.
