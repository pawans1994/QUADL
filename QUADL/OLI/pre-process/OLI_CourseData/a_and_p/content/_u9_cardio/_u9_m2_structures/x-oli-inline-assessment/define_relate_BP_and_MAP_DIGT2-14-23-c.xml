Although it can be approximated as diastolic pressure plus 1/3 the pulse pressure, it is most accurately determined by averaging the arterial pressure over time.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Because the heart spends more time in diastole than systole, a simple average of the two values is not a good approximation of mean arterial pressure.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This would, in fact, give you a mean pressure over the distance, but in the context of physiology, mean pressure indicates an average pressure at a single point over time.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
