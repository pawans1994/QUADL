Although a person with a very low blood pressure may have a “faint” pulse, this measurement is better at indicating a different variable.</feedback></response><response input="lbd2-i" match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The pulse does not provide much information about stroke volume.</feedback></response><response input="lbd2-i" match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Pulse is measured in the large arteries, which have little vascular resistance. Therefore pulse is not indicative of vascular resistance.</feedback></response><response input="lbd2-i" match="d" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Heart rate is determined by counting a person’s pulse over a specified time period.</feedback></response><hint>A pulse is created by the moving wave of pressure associated with expansion and recoiling of the arteries after every systole.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
