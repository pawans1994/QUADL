In this example, the heart will either have both or neither.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.

In this example, the heart will either have both or neither.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="1"><feedback>Correct. The AV node will take over the repeated spontaneous depolarization, such that both properties of the heart will be maintained. The rhythmicity will occur at a slower rate than if the SA node was still pacing the heart.</feedback></response><hint>Consider the situation of overdrive suppression.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
