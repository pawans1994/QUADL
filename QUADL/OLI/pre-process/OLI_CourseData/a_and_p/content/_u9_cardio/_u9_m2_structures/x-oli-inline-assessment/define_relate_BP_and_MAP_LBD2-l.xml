    <body>A single kidney is estimated to have approximately 500,000 afferent arterioles, meaning that approximately 0.001 ml of blood flows through each of these arterioles per minute. The pressure change (drop) across the afferent arteriole is typically 15 mmHg. How would you calculate the resistance of a single afferent arteriole? <input_ref input="lbd2-l"/></body>

        <response input="lbd2-l" match="*" score="1"></response>
        <hint>Apply equation 4 to this situation.</hint>
        <explanation>The resistance is given by the pressure drop divided by the flow rate. In this case it would be 15 mmHg divided by 0.001 mL/min. Thus the resistance of a single arterial is quite large! The kidney can only handle its flow rate because it has hundreds of thousands of these arterioles in parallel (many different flow paths), which greatly reduces the overall resistance. </explanation>
