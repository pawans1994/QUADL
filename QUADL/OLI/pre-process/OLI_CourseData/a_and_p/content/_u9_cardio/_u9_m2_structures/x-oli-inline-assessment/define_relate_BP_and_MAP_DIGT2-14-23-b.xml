    <!-- LO: define_relate_BP_and_MAP_OBJ-->
    <body>The reason that sound can be heard from a partially occluded artery during the measurement of blood pressure is because the change in blood vessel geometry causes the blood flow to convert from laminar, where all the fluid flows in a straight line along the length of the vessel, to turbulent, where flow can occur in a randomized fashion (like water flowing through rapids in a river).  In what way would this turbulent flow lead to the generation of sound waves?<input_ref input="DIGT2-14-23-b"/></body>
<short_answer id="DIGT2-14-23-b"/>
    <part>
        <response input="DIGT2-14-23-b" match="*" score="1"></response>
        <explanation>The turbulent flow causes some of the blood to “bump” into the walls of artery, displacing them slightly. This displacement is carried through the tissues as a sound wave.</explanation>
