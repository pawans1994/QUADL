Although both of these contribute to blood pressure, they can each be divided into more factors.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although each of these factors can affect blood pressure, the list is not comprehensive.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Blood pressure is determined by multiplying cardiac output with vascular resistance. Cardiac output is calculated as stroke volume times heart rate and vascular resistance is determined by vessel diameter (radius), vessel length and the viscosity of the fluid.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although this list is quite comprehensive, hematocrit helps determine blood viscosity, but they are not separate factors.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
