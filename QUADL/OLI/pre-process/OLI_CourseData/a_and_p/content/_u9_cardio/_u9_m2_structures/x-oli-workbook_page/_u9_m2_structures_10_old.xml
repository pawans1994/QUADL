      <!--				<p>Learning Objectives:</p>
				<p>CV2.24 Describe how blood vessel length impacts vascular resistance.</p>-->
      <p>There is a direct correlation between the length of a blood vessel and the
         amount of resistance (Equation 5). As length increases, so does resistance.
         This may be obvious if we consider the pulmonary circulation versus the
         systemic circulation. Each circulation receives the same amount of blood flow,
         but the pulmonary circulation requires much less pressure to maintain this flow
         rate. A major reason for this is that the path length for blood flow is much
         shorter through the pulmonary circulation than it is through the systemic
         circulation.</p>
      <p>Resistance to blood flow increases in people who are overweight because even a
         kilogram or two of excess fat requires miles of additional small vessels to
         supply it with blood. This increased vessel length dramatically increases the
         amount of peripheral resistance. A common consequence of obesity is
         hypertension.</p>
