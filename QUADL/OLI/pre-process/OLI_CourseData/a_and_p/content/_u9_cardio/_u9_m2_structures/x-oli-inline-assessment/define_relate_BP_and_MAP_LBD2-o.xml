This involved collecting red blood cells and re-injecting them several weeks later as a way of increasing their hematocrit (red blood cell concentration). What effect would blood doping have on vascular resistance?</p></body><multiple_choice><choice value="a">none</choice><choice value="b">increases it</choice><choice value="c">decreases it</choice></multiple_choice><part id="q1_p1"><skillref idref="define_viscosity_SKILL" /><response match="a" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Doping has an effect on the viscosity of blood.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Doping increases the viscosity of blood, which increases its resistance to flow.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Doping makes the blood more viscous, which increases resistance.</feedback></response><hint>Consider whether or not increasing hematocrit will have an effect on any properties of blood.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
