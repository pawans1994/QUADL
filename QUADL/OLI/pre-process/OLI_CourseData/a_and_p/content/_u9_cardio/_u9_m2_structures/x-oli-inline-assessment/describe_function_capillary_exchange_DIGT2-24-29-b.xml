The forces moving fluid out of the capillary include BHP, IFCOP and, in this case the IFHP because it is negative. These add up to 30 mmHg. The opposing force is the 26 mmHg BCOP, leaving a NFP of 4 mmHg out of the capillary.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Your math seems correct, but your direction does not.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. You may have made an error with the IFHP, which is negative in this case. That means it is actually pulling fluid out of the capillary.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Both the math and direction are incorrect.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
