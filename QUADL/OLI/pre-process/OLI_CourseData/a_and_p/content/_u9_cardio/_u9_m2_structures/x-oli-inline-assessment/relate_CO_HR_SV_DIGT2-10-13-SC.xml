<question id="q1">
    <body>During exercise, most of us have a maximum heart rate at or below 200 beats per minute (approximated by 220 â€“ age). If your maximum heart rate is 200 bpm and your resting stroke volume is 60 ml, what would your maximum cardiac output be without also adjusting your stroke volume? What is the benefit of also being able to adjust stroke volume? <input_ref input="DIGT2-10-13-SC"/></body>
<short_answer id="DIGT2-10-13-SC"/>
    <part>
        <response input="DIGT2-10-13-SC" match="*" score="1"/>
        <explanation>Your maximum cardiac output would be 12 L/min (60 mL/beat x 200 beats per minute) if you could not also adjust your stroke volume. The benefit of being able to also increase stroke volume is that we can reach a higher cardiac output, which benefits us during exertion.</explanation>
