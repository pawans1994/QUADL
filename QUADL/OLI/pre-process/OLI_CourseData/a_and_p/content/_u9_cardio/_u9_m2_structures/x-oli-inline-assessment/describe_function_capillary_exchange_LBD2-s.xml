            <body>There is typically lots of collagen in the interstitial space. If there is so much
                of this large protein there, why is the interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure
                so low? <input_ref input="lbd2-s"/></body>
            <short_answer id="lbd2-s"/>

                <response input="lbd2-s" match="*" score="1"/>
                <hint>Remember the role of collagen in connective tissue around these capillaries.</hint>
                <explanation>Because these large collagen molecules are not dissolved in the fluid,
                    so they don’t contribute to osmotic pressure. Instead they are structural
                    proteins that would stay in place if you were able to “dump off” the water from
                    this space, whereas dissolved proteins would move with the water.</explanation>
