            <body>In most instances, if the main artery delivering blood to tissue is occluded, the
                tissue will die. If, however, the draining vein is occluded, blood can still return
                to the heart. How can this be? <input_ref input="lbd2-w"/></body>
            <short_answer id="lbd2-w"/>

                <response input="lbd2-w" match="*" score="1"/>
                <hint>The artery and arterioles are typically going directly to target tissue or organ, the capillaries spread out in a network and the venules have to collect from these many branches. </hint>
                <explanation>There are typically more venous pathways returning blood to the heart
                    from a tissue than there are arteries delivering the blood. This provides
                    alternate routes for the blood during occlusion or removal of the veins. For
                    example, people with varicose veins in their legs commonly have the affected,
                    superficial veins removed. This can be done because deep veins are still
                    available to return blood from the feet and lower legs.</explanation>
