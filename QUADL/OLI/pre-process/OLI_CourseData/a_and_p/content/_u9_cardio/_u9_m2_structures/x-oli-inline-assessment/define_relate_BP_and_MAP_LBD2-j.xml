            <body>During exercise, cardiac output (CO) might increase three-fold. Would you expect
                the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to also increase three-fold? <input_ref
                    input="lbd2-j"/></body>
            <short_answer id="lbd2-j"/>
            <part>
                <response input="lbd2-j" match="*" score="1"/>
                <hint>During exercise the vessels supplying blood to the skeletal muscles dilate to
                    provide needed oxygen; this would decrease total peripheral resistance or
                    systemic vascular resistance.</hint>
                <explanation>No. During strenuous exercise blood pressure may only increase
                    slightly, if at all. This is because the large increase in cardiac output (CO)
                    is offset by a large decrease in peripheral vascular resistance during
                    exertion.</explanation>
