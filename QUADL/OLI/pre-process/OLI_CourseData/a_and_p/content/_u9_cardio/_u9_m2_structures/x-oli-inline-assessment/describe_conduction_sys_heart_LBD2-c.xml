A heart rate decrease would be associated with the parasympathetic nervous system and epinephrine is released with activation of the sympathetic nervous system.</feedback></response><response match="same" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Heart rate would likely change significantly.</feedback></response><response match="increase" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Epinephrine will increase the depolarization rate of the SA node, leading to a higher heart rate.</feedback></response><hint>Consider the conditions that typically activate the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
