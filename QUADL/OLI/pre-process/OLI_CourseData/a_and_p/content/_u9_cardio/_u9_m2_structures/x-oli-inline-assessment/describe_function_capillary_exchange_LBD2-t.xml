    <body> Many Americans have high blood pressure (hypertension). Do a majority of these individuals also have edema? <input_ref input="lbd2-t"/></body>
<short_answer id="lbd2-t"/>
    <part>
        <response input="lbd2-t" match="*" score="1"/>     
        <explanation>No. Although they have high blood pressure in their large arteries, this high pressure is not transmitted to the capillaries. In fact, edema is often much worse in people with certain forms of heart failure, where their arterial pressure is quite low.</explanation>
