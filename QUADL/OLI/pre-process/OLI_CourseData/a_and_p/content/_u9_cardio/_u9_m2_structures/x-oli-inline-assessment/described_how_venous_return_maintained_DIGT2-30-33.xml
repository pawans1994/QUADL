The valves are necessary to maintain one way flow as these two systems affect venous pressures.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although the skeletal muscle pump is functional in the standing position, the respiratory pump can be effective even while lying down.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. These pumps help generate the venous pressure; however, it does not have to be high initially for the pumps to work.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
