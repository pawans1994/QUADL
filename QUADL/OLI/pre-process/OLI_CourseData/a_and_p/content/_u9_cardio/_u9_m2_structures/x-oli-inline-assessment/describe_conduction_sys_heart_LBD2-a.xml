The AV node paces the heart more slowly than the SA node, and has less ability to generate high heart rates. This limits the amount of blood being pumped by the heart and decreased our ability to exert ourselves.</feedback></response><response match="same" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Because the AV node paces the heart more slowly than the SA node, this has an effect on exercise tolerance.</feedback></response><response match="increase" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Because the AV node paces the heart more slowly than the SA node, it does not aid us during exercise.</feedback></response><hint>Consider how heart rate contributes to our ability to exert ourselves.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
