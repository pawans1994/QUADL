How would the resistance between the two vessels compare?</body><multiple_choice><choice value="a">The resistance of vessel B would be 3 times that of vessel A.</choice><choice value="b">The resistance of vessel B would be 1/3 that of vessel A.</choice><choice value="c">There is no difference because their diameters are the same.</choice></multiple_choice><part id="q1_p1"><skillref idref="describe_vessel_length_impact_resistance_SKILL" /><response match="a" score="1"><feedback>Correct. The resistance of a vessel is directly proportional to its length.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Making a vessel longer does not decrease its resistance.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Even though diameter (radius) is the most important factor in determining resistance, vessel length and the viscosity of the fluid also play a role.</feedback></response><hint>In the equation for the resistance of a single vessel, determine the relationship, if any, of vessel length to resistance.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
