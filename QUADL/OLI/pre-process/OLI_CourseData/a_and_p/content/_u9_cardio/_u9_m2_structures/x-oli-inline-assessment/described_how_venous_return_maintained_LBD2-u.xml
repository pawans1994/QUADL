Preload is the amount of blood in the heart at the end of diastole (end diastolic volume), which is determined by venous return.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Afterload is the pressure that the ventricle pumps into and is not generally associated with venous return.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Stroke volume is determined by venous return via the Frank-Starling relationship; however, stroke volume itself is not the best answer here.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. End systolic volume is mainly determined by contractility and not necessarily venous return.</feedback></response><hint>Venous return refers to the volume of blood in the systemic veins that is flowing back to the heart.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
