People with hypertension (high blood pressure) often take medications that slightly decrease their blood volume. By what mechanism does the decrease in blood volume lead to a decrease in cardiac output?</body><multiple_choice><choice value="a">The decrease in blood volume leads to a decrease in contractility.</choice><choice value="b">The decrease in blood volume leads to a decrease in heart rate.</choice><choice value="c">The decrease in blood volume decreases stroke volume through the Frank-Starling mechanism.</choice></multiple_choice><part id="q1_p1"><skillref idref="explain_frank_starling_law_SKILL" /><response match="a" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. But contractility is mainly affected by the sympathetic nervous system, which only becomes more active with large changes in blood volume.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. But heart rate is mainly affected by the sympathetic nervous system, which only becomes more active with large changes in blood volume.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="1"><feedback>Correct. A decrease in blood volume leads to a decrease in preload (end-diastolic volume). According to the Frank-Starling mechanism, this will lead to a decrease in stroke volume with a corresponding decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
