    <!-- LO: define_relate_BP_and_MAP_OBJ-->
    <body>Organs regulate flow to themselves based on their metabolic needs. In what way can organs adjust their own flow? <input_ref input="lbd2-n"/></body>
    <short_answer id="lbd2-n"/>
    <part>
        <response input="lbd2-n" match="*" score="1"></response>
        <hint>Think about the blood vessel going to the organ and how its diameter might be changed to adjust the flow.</hint>
        <explanation>Organs can adjust their own flow by either dilating or constricting the blood vessels that deliver flow to them. This is likely done with local signaling molecules or the end products of metabolic processes, such as carbon dioxide or lowered pH.</explanation>
