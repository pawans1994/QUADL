				<p>CV2.35 Describe the path of the blood from the heart through the cardiovascular system.</p>-->
      <p>The two pumps of the heart are in series, meaning that the blood flows in one
         direction from one pump to the other. Starting from the left heart, the blood
         flows through the peripheral circulatory system, which provides the body with
         the nutrients it needs, such as oxygen, and removes metabolic waste, such as
         carbon dioxide. As blood moves through this circulation, it follows a path of
         blood vessels that change in their anatomy and function. Upon leaving the heart
         blood enters the major arteries. <term>Arteries </term>are the vessels in the
         circulatory system that carry blood away from the heart. These arteries branch
         and divide into <term>arterioles </term>that are smaller in diameter. These
         arterioles continue to branch out to create even smaller capillaries. These
            <term>capillaries</term>, which are found within each organ, are the site of
         gas and nutrient exchange. Once blood has perfused the organ, the capillaries
         begin to coalesce into larger <term>venules </term>that combine to create
         larger veins, ultimately returning blood to the heart through either the
         superior or inferior vena cava.</p>
