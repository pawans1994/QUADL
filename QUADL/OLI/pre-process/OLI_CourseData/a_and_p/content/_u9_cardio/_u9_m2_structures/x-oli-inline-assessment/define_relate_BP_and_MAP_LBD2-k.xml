It is not the pressure change times the flow rate that provides the resistance value.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. It is not the flow rate divided by the pressure change that provides the resistance value.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Resistance is determined by dividing the pressure change by the flow rate.</feedback></response><hint>Resistance is associated with the factors that oppose, or impede, blood flow.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
