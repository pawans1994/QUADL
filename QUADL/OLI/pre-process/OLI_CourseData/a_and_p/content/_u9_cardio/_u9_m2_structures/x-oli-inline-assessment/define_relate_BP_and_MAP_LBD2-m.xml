When the radius of the lumen increases, resistance does not increase.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although it does decrease, it is a much larger effect.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. When the radius of the lumen increases, resistance does not increase.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Resistance changes are inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius. A doubling of the radius decreases resistance significantly.</feedback></response><hint>Consider the effect of a larger blood vessel radius on resistance.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
