				<p>CV2.23 Define viscosity, and describe the blood constituents that impact blood viscosity.</p>-->
      <p><term>Viscosity </term>is a measurement of a fluid's internal resistance (how
         easily the fluid particles can slie past each other), which determines its
         ability to flow. Viscosity depends on the thickness or stickiness of a fluid. A
         fluid with a low viscosity flows quickly; a fluid with a high viscosity flows
         slowly. When the viscosity is high, it is hard to maintain fluid movement, and
         molecules cannot freely slip past each other. The viscosity of blood is mostly
         dependent on the ratio of red blood cells to blood plasma. The more red blood
         cells in a given volume of blood, the more viscous the blood. If blood
         viscosity increases, resistance increases proportionally as indicated by
         equation (5). If blood flow stays the same, an increased viscosity requires
         that the heart generate more pressure to move the flow through the system.</p>
