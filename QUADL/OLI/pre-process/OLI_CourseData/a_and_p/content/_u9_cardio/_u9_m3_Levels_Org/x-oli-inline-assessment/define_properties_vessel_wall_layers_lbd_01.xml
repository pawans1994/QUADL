The as the aorta receives blood fom the left ventricle, it absorbs most of that blood by passively expanding during systole. During diastole, the aorta passively recoils, “pushing” the blood down the arterial tree.</feedback></response><response match="choice2" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The femoral artery is a conducting artery that delivers blood under high pressure, but that does not need to absorb a large volume of blood in a rapid fashion like another vessel on this list.</feedback></response><response match="choice3" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The renal artery is a conducting artery that delivers blood under high pressure, but that does not need to absorb a large volume of blood in a rapid fashion like another vessel on this list.</feedback></response><hint>Elastin provides the ability for passive stretch and recoil of vessels.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
