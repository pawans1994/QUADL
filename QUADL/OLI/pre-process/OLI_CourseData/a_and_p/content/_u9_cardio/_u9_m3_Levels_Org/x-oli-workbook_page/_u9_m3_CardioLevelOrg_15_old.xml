		<p><term>Blood</term> is a liquid connective tissue. Connective tissues are defined as
			tissues with multiple cell types and a large extracellular matrix component. The blood
			cells, described above, serve different functions and the plasma acts as the
			extracellular matrix. Blood is a unique, complex fluid with various physical
			characteristics and functions needed to maintain a stable internal environment in the
			body. <term>Blood volume </term>is the combination of hematocrit (45 percent) and
				<term>plasma volume</term> (55 percent). <term>Hematocrit (hct) </term>is the
			fraction of blood that is composed of red blood cells (RBCs). Besides RBC, leukocytes
			(white cells) and platelets make up the rest of the formed elements. The process of
			producing blood cells is called <term>hematopoiesis</term>. <term>Stem cells </term>are
			nascent cells in the bone marrow that differentiate into various types of formed
			elements in blood.</p>
