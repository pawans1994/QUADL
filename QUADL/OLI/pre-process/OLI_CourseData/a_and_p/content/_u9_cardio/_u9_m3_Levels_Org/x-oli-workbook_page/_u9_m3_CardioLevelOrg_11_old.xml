		<title>Cells of the Vessels: Smooth Muscle Cells</title>

	</head>
	<body>
		<p>Smooth muscle tissue is found throughout the body, including around organs in the digestive, respiratory, and reproductive tracts and around blood vessels. In the cardiovascular system, smooth muscle cells wrap around the endothelial cells to provide strength to blood vessels and provide a mechanism for vessel adaptation.</p>
		<p><em style="highlight">[NOTE: link to smooth muscle cell anatomy and physiology in muscular unit]</em></p>
		<p>Smooth muscle cells contract via the actin-myosin contraction mechanism described in the muscular unit. Smooth muscle cells adjust their contraction with high levels of stretch and with chemical factors. For example, hormones related to exercise or anxiety can cause vessel constriction and nitric oxide can cause vasodilation.</p>
