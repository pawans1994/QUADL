                <p>Varicose veins are sometimes removed for either cosmetic or health-related
                    purposes. Why does their removal not have a significant impact on the venous
                    return from the legs to the heart?</p></body>

                <explanation>Varicose veins occur when the venous valves in the superficial veins
                    become incompetent, and allow backflow and venous pooling. As long as the deep
                    veins are not obstructed, they will carry all of the venous flow from the legs
                    back to the heart.</explanation>
