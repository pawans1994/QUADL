The extrinsic pathway begins after exposure of tissue factor (TF), an integral membrane glycoprotein. Damaged or ruptured endothelial blood lining activates the intrinsic pathway.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although the extrinsic pathway does use calcium, the intrinsic pathway also requires calcium ions. </feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways have enzyme cascade, although it is slower in the intrinsic pathway. </feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways both lead to clot formation.</feedback></response><hint>The extrinsic pathway is also known as the “tissue factor pathway,” and the intrinsic pathway is also known as the “contact activation pathway.”</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
