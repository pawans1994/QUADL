Clots in the coronary arteries form secondary to atherosclerotic plaque in those vessels, not ruptured chordae tendinae, which help hold some of the valve leaflets in place.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. If chordae tendinae tear, there might be a decrease in cardiac output because of altered flow within the heart.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The aortic valve is not held in place by chordae tendinae.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="10"><feedback>Correct. If the chordae tendinae holding the mitral valve leaflets tear, there is likely to be backflow (regurgitation) through the valve during ventricular systole.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
