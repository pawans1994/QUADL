            <body>There are many forms of thalassemia, but they tend to be most concentrated in
                places where malaria was/is common. What would explain this relationship between
                malaria and thalassemias? <input_ref input="RBC_disorders_LBD_5"/></body>

                <hint>The same principle applies to sickle cell anemia, where having one copy of the gene offers some protection called heterozygous advantage.</hint>
                <explanation>Thalassemias are thought to provide protection against malarial
                    infections, similar to sickle cell anemia. Thus thalassemia minor was a
                    beneficial condition, although thalassemia major would likely cause death by
                    itself.</explanation>
