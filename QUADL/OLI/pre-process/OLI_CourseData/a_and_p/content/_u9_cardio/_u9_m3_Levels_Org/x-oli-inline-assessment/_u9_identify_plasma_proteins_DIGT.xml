            <body>
                <p>Based on their functions, why are a-globulin and b-globulin produced in the liver and g-globulin is produced by immune cells?</p></body>

                <response input="identify_plasma_proteins_reflect" score="1"/>
                <explanation>a- and b- globulins transport hydrophobic materials through the blood stream whereas g-globulins are involved in immunity, so it makes sense that they are secreted by immune cells.</explanation>
