The stenotic valve causes the right atrial pressure to rise. This causes venous pressures to rise and because of the external jugular veins location relative to the skin, distension is often noticed in this vein.</feedback></response><response match="choice2" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The sagittal sinuses are found within tough connective tissue of the skull and would not distend.</feedback></response><response match="choice3" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. There is no anastomotic connection between these vessels.</feedback></response><response match="choice4" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The carotid arteries are fed from the left side of the heart. Right valve dysfunction does not have any direct effect.</feedback></response><hint>Consider what happens to the pressure in the right atrium with a narrowed atrioventricular valve.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
