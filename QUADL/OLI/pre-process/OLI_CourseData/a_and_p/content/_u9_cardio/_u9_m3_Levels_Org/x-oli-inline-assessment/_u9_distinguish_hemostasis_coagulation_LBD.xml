Blood clotting (coagulation) is the third step of hemostasis, a process that functions to impede blood loss.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Coagulation, the process by which blood forms clots, is an important part of hemostasis, a physiological response to vascular injury which impedes the loss of blood.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. While they both occur in the cardiovascular system, they are related. Hemostasis is a physiological process that impedes blood loss. It consists of three major steps: vasoconstrinction, temporarily blocking a break using a platelet plug, and coagulation, also known as blood clotting.</feedback></response><hint>Hemostasis is the normal physiological response following vascular injury.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
