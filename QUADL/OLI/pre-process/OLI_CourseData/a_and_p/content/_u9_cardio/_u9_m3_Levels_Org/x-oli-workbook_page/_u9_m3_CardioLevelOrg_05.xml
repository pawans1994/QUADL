			<title>Anemia</title>
			<body>
				<p>Anemia is a condition in which the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is
					reduced. It is indicated by a low hemoglobin concentration, and typically
					presents with a decrease in the number of red blood cells.</p>

			<title>Thalassemia</title>
			<body>
				<p><term>Thalassemia </term>is an inherited blood disorder in which the body makes
					an abnormal form of hemoglobin. The disease is most common among individuals of
					African, Asian, Greek, Italian, and Middle Eastern descent. The disorder results
					in excessive destruction of red blood cells, which leads to anemia. Adults
					hemoglobin is made of two proteins, alpha globin and beta globin. Thalassemia
					occurs when there is a defect in a gene that helps control production of one of
					these proteins.</p>
				<p>There are two main types of thalassemia: alpha thalassemia and beta thalessemia.
					Alpha thalassemia occurs when a gene or genes related to the alpha globin
					protein are missing or changed (mutated). Beta thalassemia occurs when similar
					gene defects affect production of the beta globin protein. Both alpha and beta
					thalassemia include thalassemia major and thalassemia minor. The defective gene
					must be inherited from both parents for a person to develop thalassemia major
					(it is a homozygous condition). Thalassemia minor occurs if the defective gene
					is inherited from only one parent. Persons with this form of the disorder are
					carriers of the disease and usually do not have symptoms, even though they have
					microcytic (small) red blood cells. Beta thalassemia major is also called
					Cooley's anemia. The most severe form of alpha thalassemia major causes
					stillbirth. Children born with thalessemia major (Cooley's anemia) are normal at
					birth but develop severe anemia during the first year of life. Other symptoms
					can include bone deformities in the face and growth failure. Persons with the
					minor form of alpha and beta thalassemia have small red blood cells visible
					under a microscope, but no symptoms.</p>
				<p>Treatment for thalassemia major often involves regular blood transfusions and
					folate supplements. Persons who receive significant numbers of blood
					transfusions need a treatment called chelation therapy to remove excess iron
					from the body. A bone marrow transplant may help treat the disease in some
					patients, especially children. Severe thalassemia can cause early death due to
					heart failure, usually between ages 20 to 30. Less severe forms of thalassemia
					usually do not result in a shortened lifespan.</p>
