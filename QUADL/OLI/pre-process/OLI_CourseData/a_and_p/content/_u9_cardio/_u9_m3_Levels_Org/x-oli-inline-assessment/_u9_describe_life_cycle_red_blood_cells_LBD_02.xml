Transferrin is an iron-binding transport protein in the bloodstream so new hemoglobin can be produced by red blood cells developing in the bone marrow.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Ferritin is an iron-binding protein, but it stores iron in tissues and cells, not circulating in the blood.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="10"><feedback>Incorrect. Hemosiderin is an iron-binding protein, but it stores iron in tissues and cells, not circulating in the blood.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Iron is a structural part of the hemoglobin molecule for oxygen transport, but hemoglobin is not &quot;transporting&quot; the iron to other tissues through the blood.</feedback></response><hint>Iron serves several vital functions and is vital for survival.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
