             <choice value="choice1">Elastic arteries</choice>

            <response match="choice1" score="10"> 
                <feedback>Correct. The elastic arteries are comprised of extensive elastic sheeting and are able to expand and retract passively based on the pressure inside of the vessels.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="choice2" score="0"> 
                <feedback>Incorrect. The muscular arteries, or distributing arteries, have a higher percentage of smooth muscle that allows them to actively dilate and/or contstrict to regulate blood flow.</feedback>
