A patent foramen ovale is between the atria, not the pulmonary artery and aorta.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This condition could be caused by a patent ductus arteriosus.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The shunt is between the two atria, and because pressure is typically higher in the left atrium, blood shunts from there, through the opening, and into the right atrium.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Because under most circumstances pressure is higher in the left atrium than the right, the blood shunts from left to right.</feedback></response><hint>This condition leaves a small opening between the atria.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
