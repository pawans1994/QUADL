            <body>Blood donations are typically restricted to once every six weeks, while plasma
                donations can occur much more frequently (some places will allow you to donate twice
                a week). Why should you donate blood less frequently?</body>

                <response match="blood_donation" score="10"/>
                <hint>Think about the difference between "whole" blood and only plasma and how you body produces the various components of blood.</hint>
                <explanation>When donating blood, you are donating the plasma and the cell fraction.
                    It takes much longer to replenish the cell fraction than it does the plasma
                    fraction, which is mostly water and proteins.</explanation>
