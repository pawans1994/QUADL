			<title>Elastin</title>
			<body>
				<p>Blood vessels need an ability to constrict or dilate, and the extracellular
					matrix of most vessels is called the elastic laminae. The elastic laminae has a
					high concentration of the elastin protein. Elastin, when combined with other
					extracellular components helps blood vessels and other tissues, including skin,
					to return to their original shapes after dilation or is deformation. Elastin
					molecules are disorganized, entangled and crosslinked. When stretched, these
					fibers straighten out, but will recoil back to normal when force is released on
					the tissues.</p>

			<title>Collagen</title>
			<body>
				<p><term>Collagen </term>is a stiff, filamentous extracellular protein found in most
					connective tissues. Collagen filaments are composed of twisted protofilaments,
					and protofilaments themselves are also twisted. Thus, collagen has ropelike
					qualities that provide stiffness. In blood vessels, collagen is found in the
					tunicia externa and provides stiffness to the blood vessel to prevent rupture.
					Arteries contain blood at higher pressure than veins so they have a thicker
					layer of collagen than veins.</p>
