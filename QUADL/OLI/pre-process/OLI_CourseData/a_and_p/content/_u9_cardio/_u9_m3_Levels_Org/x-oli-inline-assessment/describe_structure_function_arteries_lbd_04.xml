The iliac artery runs along the ilium of the hip bone. The femoral artery runs along the femur and continues as the popliteal artery behind the knee and then the tibial artery along the tibia. Finally the plantar artery is in the ankle.</feedback></response><response match="choice2" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The femoral artery runs along the femur, but prior to blood reaching that artery it has to get from the abdominal aorta to the femoral artery by traversing an artery that runs along the ilium. The popliteal artery is also proximal to the tibial artery.</feedback></response><response match="choice3" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This would be the order of vessels if we were moving distal to proximal.</feedback></response><response match="choice4" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The plantar artery is most distal, the next most distal is the tibial, followed by popliteal, femoral and iliac.</feedback></response><hint>Proximal is where the blood is flowing from (abdominal aorta) and distal is where the blood is flowing to (ankle).</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
