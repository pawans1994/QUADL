Although the shunt pathway is between the atria, the higher pressure of the left atrium (under normal conditions) causes the blood to move from the left atrium to the right atrium.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The shunt pathway is between the two atria, with the higher pressure in the left atrium pushing blood into the right atrium.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. In this condition, the shunt pathway is between the atria, not between an atrium and ventricle.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although with this condition blood from the pulmonary vein may move into the right atrium instead of passing through the systemic circulation, the blood does not pass directly from the pulmonary vein into the right atrium.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
