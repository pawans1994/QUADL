            <body>Why does chemotherapy often lead to neutropenia?</body>

                <hint>Stem cells and cancer cells have something in common.</hint>
                <explanation>Neutrophils are generated at a fairly high rate in the bone marrow,
                    where they are produced through mitosis of bone marrow stem cells. Because many
                    chemotherapy drugs target cells with a high mitotic rate, neutropenia, along
                    with anemia and thrombocytopenia, are common side effects of many anticancer
                    drugs.</explanation>
