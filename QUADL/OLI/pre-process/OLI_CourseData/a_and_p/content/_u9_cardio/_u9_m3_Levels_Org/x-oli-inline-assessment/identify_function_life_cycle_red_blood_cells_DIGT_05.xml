Because type O blood does not contain A or B cell surface antigens, and also lacks the D antigen of the Rh factor, there are no antigens on these cells to react with antibodies in a personâ€™s plasma.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although type O blood does not contain A or B cell surface antigens, the positive indicates that it does contain the D antigen of the Rh group. Even though most people will not have antibodies against the D antigen unless they were previously exposed to it, there is a risk that they will carry these antibodies, leading to a transfusion reaction.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Type AB blood contains both A and B antigens, so anyone that has either anti-A or anti-B antibodies in their plasma cannot be transfused with this type of blood.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Type AB blood contains both A and B antigens, so anyone that has either anti-A or anti-B antibodies in their plasma cannot be transfused with this type of blood.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
