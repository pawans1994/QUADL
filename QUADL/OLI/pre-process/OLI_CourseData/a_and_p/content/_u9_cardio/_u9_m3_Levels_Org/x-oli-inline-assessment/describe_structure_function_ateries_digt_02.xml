            <body>Pressure on the neck near one of the carotid sinuses can cause unconsciousness because:</body>
         <multiple_choice shuffle="true">
             <choice value="choice1">It physically blocks blood from flowing to the brain.</choice>
             <choice value="choice2">It mimics high blood pressure and results in vasodilation.</choice>
             <choice value="choice3">It mimics high blood pressure and results in vasoconstriction.</choice>
             <choice value="choice4">It causes the heart to stop beating.</choice>

            <response match="choice1" score="0"> 
                <feedback>Incorrect. The blood supply to the brain is redundant help to prevent a single blockage from stopping all flow.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="choice2" score="10"> 
                <feedback>Correct. The carotid sinuses have receptors that sense blood pressure.  If external pressure is place on them it cause a reflex vasodilation to lower the blood pressure. Blood pressure can become so low a person could become dizzy and lose consciousness.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="choice3" score="0"> 
                <feedback>Incorrect. The carotid sinuses have receptors to sense blood pressure, if external pressure mimics high pressure they will react to lower blood pressure through vasodilation not vasoconstriction.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="choice4" score="0"> 
                <feedback>Incorrect. Pressure to the carotid sinuses will not signal the heart to stop beating, although it may slow the heart rate.</feedback>
