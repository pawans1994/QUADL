Why does the thorax not need many veins carrying blood to the vena cava?</p></body><short_answer id="number_veins_thorax" whitespace="trim" case_sensitive="false" /><part id="e45c51e485ad415e80d4bc7574d1384d"><hint><p id="aab5d8fe0eb7f4f05888a337124d1c3b8">Think about the blood flow from the major thoracic organs back to the heart.</p></hint><explanation><p id="aaffd6e5de0d248608b9ca4926ed037c8">The thoracic space is mainly taken up by the lungs and the heart. The lungs drain into the left side of the heart via the pulmonary veins and the heart drains directly into the right atrium via the coronary sinus. That leaves the mammary and wall tissues that do drain into the vena cava via the brachiocephalic veins or azygos system.</p></explanation></part></question></page></assessment>
