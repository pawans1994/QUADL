In DIC, clotting factors are consumed after a significant body insult, leaving the person at risk for excessive bleeding.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Hemophilia A (most common type of hemophilia) is a genetic deficiency in clotting factor VIII, which leads to excessive bleeding, not because the clotting factors have been overconsumed.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Hemophilia B (second most common type of hemophilia) is a genetic deficiency in clotting factor IX (also known as Christmas disease), which leads to excessive bleeding, not because the clotting factors have been overconsumed.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Factor VII deficiency is caused by a genetic deficiency in a clotting factor and/or vitamin K deficiency, which leads to excessive bleeding, not because the clotting factors have been overconsumed.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
