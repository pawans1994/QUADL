The plaque prevents the coronary arteries from dilating so that they cannot deliver as much blood (and therefore oxygen) to the downstream myocytes.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. At rest, the heart cells are not receiving too much blood, they get just enough. But signs do develop when the activity level of the cells increases and supply cannot meet this demand.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Plaques grow slowly and do not acutely change size.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. There are few anastomoses in the heart at any time and it doesn’t change with exertion.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
