There is more blood flowing into the heart with a greater venous return.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although there is more blood flowing into the heart, this does not directly affect the coronary perfusion, which determines the amount of oxygen the myocytes receive.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The actin and myosin overlap decreases with greater dilation of the ventricles. This leads to less crossbridge formation and a lower force of contraction.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Afterload is the pressure the heart pumps into (for the left ventricle, this is aortic pressure), which is not significantly increased with an increase in venous return.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
