That is, a tissue is a group of cells with a similar shape and function. In turn, organs (which make up the body) are comprised of various tissues. Broadly speaking, there are only four types of tissues: muscle tissue, nerve tissue, connective tissue and epithelial tissue. </p><p id="edb72d2b7b174cabbfac34066ef5878e">An organ is made up of tissues that work together to perform a specific function for the body as a whole.
