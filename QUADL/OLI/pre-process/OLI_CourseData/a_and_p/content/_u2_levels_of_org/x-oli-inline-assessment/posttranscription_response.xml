        <body>
            <p>If cytoplasmic mRNA from a eukaryote were allowed to form a hydrogen-bonded RNA-DNA hybrid structure with the melted chromosome from the same organism, would it be possible to identify the introns? On which strand would you expect to see loops of single stranded nucleotides?</p>

            <explanation>
                <p>Yes, the introns would still be present in the DNA, forming single-stranded DNA loops.</p>
