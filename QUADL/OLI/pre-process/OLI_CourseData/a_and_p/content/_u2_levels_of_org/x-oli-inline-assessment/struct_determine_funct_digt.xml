If a cell was long and branched it would have difficulty moving in blood vessels to travel throughout the body.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. A circular, compressible cell would not have good leverage or strength to move proteins.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. A long, branched cell structure would allow this cell to connect to many other cells at once for communication</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. A cell that is already packed with protein would not be good for storing fat.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
