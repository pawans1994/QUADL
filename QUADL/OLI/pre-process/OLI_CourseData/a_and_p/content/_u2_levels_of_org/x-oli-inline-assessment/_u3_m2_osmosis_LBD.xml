Water tends to move down its own concentration gradient.

Water tends to move down its own concentration gradient. But in an isotonic solution, there is no gradient: solute concentrations outside and inside the cell are equal. </feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Solute concentrations are equal inside and outside the cell. There will be no net flow of water; water molecules will move at equal rates both into and out of the cell. </feedback></response><hint>Water moves from high concentration to low concentration.</hint><hint>The cell and external environment are equal concentrations.</hint><hint>Therefore water will not have a net movement in either direction.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
