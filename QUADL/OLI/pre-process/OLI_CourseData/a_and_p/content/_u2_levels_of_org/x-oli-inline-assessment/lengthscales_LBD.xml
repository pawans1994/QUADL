Insulin is 44x larger than calcium and pancreatic beta cells are 4000x larger than insulin.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Atoms and ions are smaller than proteins. Insulin is made up of more than a thousand atoms.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Cells are larger than ions, but cells are much larger than proteins.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Cells are the largest of these choices</feedback></response><hint>Insulin is a protein made of 51 amino acids, and each amino acid has about 20 atoms.</hint><hint>In most cells, are more than a billion proteins.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
