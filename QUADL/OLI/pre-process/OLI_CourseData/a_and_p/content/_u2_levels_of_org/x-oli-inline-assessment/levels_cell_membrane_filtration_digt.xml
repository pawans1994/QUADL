Filtration does not require ATP, it is an example of a passive process.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Since it is a passive process, it does require a gradient but not a concentration gradient like diffusion.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. It is nonselective â€“ this means it cannot determine what passes, remember molecules only pass based on size and pressure.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Even though filtration is a passive process and does not require ATP it does need some sort of gradient to move the molecules.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
