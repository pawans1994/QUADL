               <!--<hint>What are the geometric properties of a carbon that forms four single bonds, is it planar or tetrahydral?
               </hint>-->
            <explanation>
                <p>All amino acids have a hydrogen atom, a carboxyl and an amino group attached to the central alpha-carbon.  If the fourth group (side chain) on the alpha carbon is also a hydrogen, a carboxyl or an amino group, the amino acid will have no enantiomers.  In nature, glycine has two hydrogen atoms and is achiral (not chiral).  </p>
