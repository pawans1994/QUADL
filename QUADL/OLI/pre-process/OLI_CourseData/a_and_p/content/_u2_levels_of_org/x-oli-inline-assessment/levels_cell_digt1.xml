A cardiac muscle cell is packed with protein fibers and interconnected with other cardiac muscle cells in the heart to ensure that the heart muscle contracts as a unit to propel blood.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. A red blood cell lacks most organelles, including the nucleus. It is a sac of hemoglobin to transport the respiratory gasses oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2).</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. A nerve cell, or neuron, is a highly branched cell that is able to rapidly communicate with other cells within and between the nervous system and the body.</feedback></response><hint>Think about what shape the cell would need to accomplish its role - this one lacks most organelles, including the nucleus.</hint><hint>Its purpose is for transportation of oxygen and carbon dioxide.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
