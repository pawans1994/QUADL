Pneumonia is a lung infection which results in an accumulation of pus and mucus around the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. What do you think will happen to the diffusion rate of O2 in such a patient?</body><multiple_choice select="single" shuffle="true"><choice value="A">It would increase</choice><choice value="B">It would decrease</choice><choice value="C">There would not be a change</choice></multiple_choice><part id="i551b8c2b9a2344bcb12ea55d6a80d783"><skillref idref="levels_cell_membrane_diffusion_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Think about the thickness of the medium that the O2 would have to diffuse through and how that affects diffusion rate.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The increased secretions increase the distance the O2 must travel and slows diffusion.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.
