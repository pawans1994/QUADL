Although molecules can contain more than 1 element, many, such as oxygen (O2) contain the same element.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although molecules may be made of more than one atom of the same element (such as O2), many molecules (such as H2O) contain atoms of different elements.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Molecules are neutral, which aids in their stability.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Molecules are stable bonds between atoms of the same or differing elements.</feedback></response><response match="E" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Molecules are not charged</feedback></response><hint>Molecules are commonly found in the environment because these are stable configurations.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
