Ionic bonds can also be stable in air, such as table salt.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Covalent bonds can also be stable in air, such as glucose.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Ionic bonding involves a complete transfer of one electron to another, so that sharing is not occurring. Covalent bonds do share valence electrons.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although ionic bonds occur between atoms of differing electronegativities, covalent bonds can occur between atoms of similar, or differing, electronegativities.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
