Remember carbohydrates are associated with membrane proteins to form glycoproteins for cell recognition.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The bulk of the membrane is formed by a double layer of phospholipids.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Remember integral and peripheral proteins are critical for the passage of molecules across the membrane that wouldn’t pass through the phospholipid bilayer.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Cholesterol is found in the membrane and contributes to it’s fluidity.</feedback></response><response match="E" score="10"><feedback>Correct. A cell membrane is mainly composed of a double layer of phospholipids with cholesterol, proteins, and glycoproteins found in and on it.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
