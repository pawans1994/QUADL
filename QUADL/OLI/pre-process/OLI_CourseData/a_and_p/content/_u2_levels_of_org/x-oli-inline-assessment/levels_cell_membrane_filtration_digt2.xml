If a patient complains of back pain, has a fever, and a urinalysis shows protein (plasma protein albumin) in the urine, why might this be significant?</body><multiple_choice select="single" shuffle="true"><choice value="A">It is not significant; the protein in the urine is normal. The patient&apos;s symptoms are probably not a result of kidney problems, a pulled muscle perhaps.</choice><choice value="B">It is significant because protein in the urine is abnormal. The patient may have a problem with their kidney.</choice></multiple_choice><part id="i1d797805bd454535873525099ca2bce7"><skillref idref="levels_membrane_filtration_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Proteins are large molecules and too big to leave the blood by filtration.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Proteins are large molecules which should not pass through a cell membrane via filtration.</feedback></response><hint>Think about if it makes sense that plasma proteins would be filtered from the blood, passing through a cell membrane and enter the kidney.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
