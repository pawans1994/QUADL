A cardiac muscle cell must connect closely with other cells in the heart to ensure the heart muscle contracts as a unit to pump blood.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. A red blood cell lacks most organelles, including the nucleus. It is a sac of hemoglobin to transport the respiratory gasses oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2).</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct.
