Although 5 kcal/mol seems low, the sum of all hydrogen bonds at the surface of water is very large.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Hydrogen bonding does stabilize the three-dimensional structure of water-soluble macromolecules.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Polar molecules are able to integrate into the hydrogen bonding network of water.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="10"><feedback>covalent bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds. Usually a covalent bond is considered a ‘permanent’ linkage and a hydrogen bond is used for stabilization.</feedback></response><hint>Hydrogen bonds are used for inter-molecular interactions: water-water, water-macromolecule, etc.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
