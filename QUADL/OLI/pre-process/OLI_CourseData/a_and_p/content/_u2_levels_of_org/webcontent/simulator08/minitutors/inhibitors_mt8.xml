substrate concentration on the inhibition by competitive inhibitors.

&lt;b&gt;Using the radio dials at the right, select a substrate concentration of  [S]=50.

The observed decrease in the velocity for the reaction in the presence of the inhibitor is almost the same as the unihibited reaction because:
