using the same binding site that would be used by the substrate.  The blue balls are &lt;b&gt;competing&lt;/b&gt; for the substrate binding site, and are therefore will be &lt;b&gt;competitive inhibitors&lt;/b&gt;.
               
The black curve represents the velocity versus substrate obtained in the absence of any inhibitor.

&lt;b&gt;Using the radio dials at the right, select substrate concentrations of  [S]=2 or [S]=4.
The observed decrease in the velocity for the reaction in the presence of the inhibitor is lowered because:
