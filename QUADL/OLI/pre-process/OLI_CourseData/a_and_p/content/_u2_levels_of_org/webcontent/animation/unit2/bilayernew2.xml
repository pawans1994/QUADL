        <text>&lt;html&gt;The lipids in the membrane are in random bulk flow moving about 22 Âµm (micrometers) per second. Phospholipids freely move in the same layer of the membrane and rarely flip to the other layer. Flipping of phospholipids from one layer to the other rarely occurs because flipping requires the hydrophilic head to pass through the hydrophobic region of the bilayer.&lt;/html&gt;
