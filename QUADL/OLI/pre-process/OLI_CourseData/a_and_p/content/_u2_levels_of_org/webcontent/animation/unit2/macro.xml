<text>&lt;html&gt;Many macromolecules are taken into the cell by a process described as endocytosis. The macromolecules do not pass through the membrane directly to the cytoplasm but instead are taken up by the cell, processed by cell and then delivered to the cytoplasm. For many of the endocytic processes, the uptake of the molecule is very specific and is controlled by recognition of the molecule by a specific receptor on the surface of the cell. This process is called Receptor Mediated Endocytosis.
  
Another form of directed but not receptor mediated uptake of large and small molecules is Protein Transduction. In this case the "cargo" to be imported carries a positively charged peptide fragment that ionically interacts with negative regions of the membrane. This binding initiates endocytosis to deliver the "cargo" in a vesicle to the inside of the cell.&lt;/red&gt; &lt;/html&gt;

        <text>&lt;html&gt;Once inside the cell and encapsulated in a vesicle, the "cargo" can be delivered to organelles such as the Golgi for further processing by the cell. In some cases the processing follows a retrograde endomembrane transport system for post-translational modification.
