<BR>

<P>
The <B>left</B> graph
shows rat movement as a function of time (min) after injection of PCP<sup>*</sup> (3mg/kg PCP).
Approximately 20 minutes after receiving PCP the rats become very agitated and
remain so for the next hour.

<P> The <B>right</B> graph shows how injection of one equivalent of anti-PCP
antibody prevents the effects of PCP. The antibody is injected 30 minutes
after the PCP injection and rapidly reverses the effects of PCP.

<P><sup>*</sup>Long arrows indicate injection of PCP. Shorter arrows indicate
injection of either saline (left graph) or antibody (right graph). Saline is
essentially salt water.
