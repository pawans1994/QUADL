        <text>&lt;html&gt;Many macromolecules are taken into the cell by a process described as endocytosis. The macromolecules do not pass through the membrane directly to the cytoplasm but instead are taken up by the cell, processed by cell and then delivered to the cytoplasm. For many of the endocytic processes, the uptake of the molecule is very specific and is controlled by recognition of the molecule by a specific receptor on the surface of the cell. This process is called Receptor Mediated Endocytosis.
            This simulation describes the process of &lt;b&gt;Receptor Mediated Endocytosis&lt;/b&gt; that involves all of the components illustrated on the stage in the lower right panel. Each component is labeled and will be introduced as the simulation proceeds. The lower left panel provides a breakdown of the steps involved and the green play arrow advances the animation through the separate steps providing a simulation of each step. It is possible to repeat a step by clicking on the name of that step in the lower left panel.&lt;/red&gt; &lt;/html&gt;

        <text>&lt;html&gt;Starting with the detail of the plasma membrane and the binding of the LDL particle to the LDL receptor, the animation will not focus on the process of endocytosis. To bring all of the players to the same scale we will successively zoom in from the plasma membrane with the full lipid bilayer illustrated to simplified symbols for each of the components.
