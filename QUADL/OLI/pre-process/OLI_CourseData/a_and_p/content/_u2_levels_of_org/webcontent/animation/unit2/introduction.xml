        <text>&lt;html&gt;In general endocytosis, a molecule or particle encounters the cell surface and randomly causes the membrane to create first a pit in the membrane, followed by a further invagination of the plasma membrane and finally the pinching off of the plasma membrane around the molecule or particle resulting in the formation of a vesicle in the cytoplasm of the cell &lt;/html&gt; </text>

        <text>&lt;html&gt;Pinocytosis and phagocytosis are both types of endocytosis. Pinocytosis is cellular drinking and phagocytosis is cellular eating. 
Receptor mediated endocytosis is a process by which cells internalize specific molecules recognized by complimentary membrane associated receptors. The process follows a typical endocytic uptake into newly formed internal vesicles.&lt;/html&gt; </text>
