     <text>&lt;html&gt;Phospholipids bilayers undergo a cooperative phase transition or melting that is similar to protein denaturation. The high degree of cooperativity is due to extensive interactions between the non-polar acyl chains in the center of the bilayer. The overall structure of the lipid bilayer is not changed by this transition. However, the disorder of the non-polar hydrocarbon chains increases dramatically after melting.&lt;/html&gt;

        <text>&lt;html&gt;At low temperatures the saturated acyl chains are able to pack close to each other as extended chains. This is very stable configuration because of the favorable van der Waals interactions between the chains. This causes the membrane to be solid-like below the melting temperature. As the temperature rises, clusters of phospholipids melt, followed by melting of the entire bilayer. At temperatures above the melting temperature the acyl-chains are disorder or fluid. 
&lt;br&gt;The following shows the melting of a pure phosphatidylcholine membrane with myristic fatty acids (C14).&lt;/html&gt;
