nucleus=The nucleus-A double membrane bound organelle that contains the DNA and the nucleolus.&golgi=Golgi apparatus-Proteins are processed in the Golgi apparatus. They are sorted for packaging and secretion.&er=The Endoplasmic Recticulum-Membrane bound and secreted proteins are processed in the ER.&lysosome=The Lysosome-A place of degradation in the cell. Many of the enzymes of the lysosome are active only at a low pH. The lysosome maintains a pH less than 5 by proton pumps in the membrane.&cytoplasm=The Cytosol-The is the matrix of the cell that supports all the constitutent parts.&nucleolus=The Nucleolus-This organelle resides in the nucleus and is the site of ribosome assembly. The nucleolus is not membrane bound.&mitochondria=The Mitochondria-This double membrane organelle is the site of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation and thus ATP synthesis. The inner membrane is highly folded forming the cristae.&vessicles=The vessicles-These are small membrane bound carriers of protiens and other compounds.&actin=Actin-The actin forms the cytoskeleton or scaffold that gives the cell shape. The actin also provide "tracks" for cargo movement through out the cell.&cell_membrane=The Cell Membrane-The cell membrane provides the barrier between the cell and the local environment.
