In the case of eukaryotic organisms, they also contain the steroid cholesterol. The phospholipid component of the biological membrane is responsibile for the key property of membranes, they act as an impermeable barrier towards most molecules. Many molecules can only cross the membrane with the aid of proteins within the membrane.  Therefore, membranes define the boundary of cells as well intra-cellular organelles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;red&gt;Click the play button to advance through the next scenes.&lt;/red&gt; &lt;/html&gt;        </text>    </step>    <step stepURL="swfs/introduction.swf"  menustep="Introduction">        <text>&lt;html&gt;When fatty acids or phospholipids are added to water they self-assemble into aggregates such that the charged or polar heads groups make contact with the water and the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails are restricted to water-free areas.
