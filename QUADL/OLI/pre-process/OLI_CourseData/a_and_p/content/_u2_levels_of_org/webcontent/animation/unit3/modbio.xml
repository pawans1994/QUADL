        <text>&lt;html&gt;The enzymatic and structural features of DNA replication in all organisms are very similar.  These animations illustrate the processes involved in the replication of the Eschericia coli chromosome.  The names of the DNA sites, enzymes, and other protein factors differ in viruses and in eukaryotic organisms, however, the basic features have been highly conserved in evolution.
In E. coli, DNA replication begins at a single site on the chromosome called "OriC".&lt;/html&gt;

    <step stepURL="DnaReplication/swfs/initiation2.swf" menustep="        DnaA binding">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;DnaA protein, complexed with ATP, binds to several specific sites at the E. coli origin of replication (OriC).&lt;/html&gt;
        </text>
    </step>

    <step stepURL="DnaReplication/swfs/initiation3.swf" menustep="        Open Complex formation">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;Following ATP hydrolysis, a ~50 base pair region in OriC DNA is melted, i.e. unwound to form a single-stranded region called the "open complex". &lt;/html&gt;
        </text>
    </step>

    <step stepURL="DnaReplication/swfs/initiation4.swf" menustep="        Prepriming Complex">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;Assembly of the two replication forks begins with the addition of the DnaB (helicase) protein.  DnaC is a helper protein that is required to load DnaB into the "prepriming complex". &lt;/html&gt;
        </text>
    </step>

    <step stepURL="DnaReplication/swfs/initiation5.swf" menustep="        Helicase & Gyrase">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;Helicase is required to extend the melted region of the open complex.

DNA gyrase is bound at many sites on the E. coli  chromosome (only two are shown here); it uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to introduce negative supercoiling into the DNA.
            
In addition to its essential role in DNA replication, DNA gyrase is also required for keeping the chromosome in a compact state and for modulating the expression of several genes.&lt;/html&gt;
        </text>
    </step>

    <step stepURL="DnaReplication/swfs/initiation6.swf" menustep="        SSB protein">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;Extension of the melted region requires the binding of single-stranded binding protein (SSB).  Coating the otherwise exposed DNA strands with SSB prevents reformation of the double stranded DNA.  

SSB is required at all stages of the replication process.

In the following segments we will depict events at only one of the two replication forks.  The steps at both of the bidirectional forks are identical.  It is also likely that both forks proceed from closely-linked locations near the center of the mother cell.&lt;/html&gt;

    <step stepURL="DnaReplication/swfs/initiation7.swf" menustep="        Replisome at one fork">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;The final steps in the assembly of the "replisome" involve the binding of DnaG (primase) protein next to the helicase, and the loading of two DNA polymerase III holoenzymes at each fork.

RNA primers (red) are synthesized on both strands at the fork.
            
DNA Pol III is a large multisubunit enzyme.  The Î²-subunit is shown as a blue ring attached to the rest of the enzyme; it is the "essential processivity factor"&lt;/html&gt;
        </text>
    </step>

    <step stepURL="DnaReplication/swfs/elongation.swf" menustep="Elongation of leading & lagging strands">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;The RNA primers are extended by DNA Pol III (continuously on the leading strand and discontinously on the lagging strand).  Synthesis of the daughter strands requires the unwinding of parental DNA by DnaB helicase (with ATP hydrolysis).  The positive supercoiling that results from replication fork movement is removed by DNA gyrase (with ATP hydrolysis).
            Each DNA Pol III synthesizes DNA at about 1000 nucleotides per second.  (This animation is a "super-slow motion" version of the real events, i.e. ~15 nucleotides/min.) &lt;/html&gt;

    <step stepURL="DnaReplication/swfs/later_elongation.swf" menustep="Later Elongation: DNA PolI & DNA ligase">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;After a segment of DNA has been replicated, the ~1 kbase DNA-RNA fragments (Okasaki fragments) on the lagging strand are modified by removal of the RNA segments and joining of the fragments to produce a continuous DNA strand.  The 5'-->3' exonuclease activity of Pol I removes the RNA primers. The nucleotide monophosphates are released and recycled. 
            The resulting small gap is filled-in by the 5'-->3' polymerase activity of Pol I. When Dna Pol I dissociates, all base pairs are formed, but there is still an unformed phosphodiester bond. DNA ligase binds to this "nick" and "seals" it using energy from ATP (or NAD+) hydrolysis.&lt;/html&gt;
