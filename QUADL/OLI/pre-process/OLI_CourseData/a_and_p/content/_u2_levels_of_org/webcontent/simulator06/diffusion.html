This prototype molecule remembers the properties and also contains the variables used to keep track of how many of these objects there are and in what state. Then the designated instances of each of the molecules is create and turn loose into the environment.<br />    Once the motion begins, the molecules move within the box following the  rules they have been given: <br />    If a molecule is of behavior ligand it can pass through the walls of the inner ligand box approximately 50% of the time. Molecules of behavior molecule never can.  We will need to change this so that we provide a size to a molecule or just a property.<br />    An additional rule is that if a molecule&rsquo;s current behavior is that of a ligand, whenever it moves, it needs to check to see if  it has collided with the binding pocket of a molecule it can bind with.  If so, they will bind. <br />    Whenever a ligand moves, it needs to see if it&rsquo;s clock has expired so that it needs to decide if it should unbind from it&rsquo;s molecule. At this point we also check to see if the ligand should become a product.<br />    Whenever a moleule moves, if an equilibrium clock is set it needs to check to see if it is to change state.<br />    Whenever a molecule is created or deleted or binds or unbinds, counter changeVal messages are sent through the system.  If there are display boxes on the stage listening for these messages, they will update their displays.<br />    We are also moving towards allowing a binding action to either be mostly a temporary where we just need to display a different view of the bound ligand for a short period of time, or a more complicated change where we will &ldquo;kill&rdquo; either or both of the bound molecules and create the appropriate new object(s) with their embedded behaviors.  This will allow us to model a ligand going to product as well as two molecules binding (semi-permanently) to form a new molecule with different properties. </span></p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <p>    <object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=7,0,0,0" width="500" height="333" id="simulator" align="middle">      <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain" />      <param name="movie" value="simulator.swf?mypath=&Myfile=XMLS/diffusion.xml" />      <param name="quality" value="high" />      <param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" />      <embed src="simulator.swf??mypath=&Myfile=XMLS/diffusion.xml" quality="high" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="500" height="333" name="simulator" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="sameDomain" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" />        </object>    </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left"><span class="style2">First, prototype molecules are created for each of the molecules specified under the initialize action.
