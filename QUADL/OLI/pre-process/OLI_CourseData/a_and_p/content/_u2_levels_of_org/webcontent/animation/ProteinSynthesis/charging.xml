        <text>&lt;html&gt;The correct charging of tRNAs by the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aa-RS) is essential to the cell because once it is attached to a tRNA, an amino acid will be incorporated into protein strictly on the basis of the codon-anticodon interaction at the ribosome.       
         &lt;/html&gt;

        <text>&lt;html&gt;In this reaction the correct amino acid is joined to the 3' CAA sequence of the tRNA. This is a two-step reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase:

In the &lt;b&gt;FIRST STEP&lt;/b&gt; in this reaction, ATP and the amino acid bind to the aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase. This is followed by activation of the amino acid by hydrolysis of the bound ATP and attachment of the resulting adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to the carboxy-terminus of the amino acid.

        <text>&lt;html&gt;In the &lt;b&gt;SECOND STEP&lt;/b&gt;, the specific tRNA binds to the synthetase and the amino acid is transferred to the 3'-OH group of the tRNA. Upon bond transfer from AMP to tRNA, the complex dissociates and the charged tRNA is released into solution. Bioselective binding of the tRNA and the amino acid to the appropriate synthetase ensures the charging of the tRNA with the correct amino acid.
