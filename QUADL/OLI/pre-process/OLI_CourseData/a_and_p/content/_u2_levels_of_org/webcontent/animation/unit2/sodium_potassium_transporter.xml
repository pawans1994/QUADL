        <text>&lt;html&gt;The energy that cells use is chemical bond energy, the shared electrons that holds atoms together in molecules.Cell movements require energy and chemical reactions are the font of energy in every living cell. Most cell processes use the same energy source: adenosine tri phosphate ATP. The ATP contains three phosphate groups. The bond between the second and third phosphate groups can be broken to release a small amount of energy. &lt;/html&gt;</text>

    <text>&lt;html&gt;This is an example of an antiport transporter than uses the energy of ATP to transport 3 Na+ ions outside of the cell in exchange for the influx of 2 K+ ions into the cell. The main features of the cycle are:
   1) Binding of 3 Na+ ions
   2) Phosphorylation of a carboxylic group by ATP, causing an allosteric change in the enzyme, allowing the Na+ to cross.
   3) Two K+ bind to the external face of the transporter.
   4) Dephosophorylation of the enzyme causes another allosteric change, bringing the K+ into the cell&lt;/html&gt;</text>
