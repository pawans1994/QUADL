        <text>&lt;html&gt;The RNA primers are extended by DNA Pol III (continuously on the leading strand and discontinously on the lagging strand).  Synthesis of the daughter strands requires the unwinding of parental DNA by DnaB helicase (with ATP hydrolysis).  The positive supercoiling that results from replication fork movement is removed by DNA gyrase (with ATP hydrolysis).
            Each DNA Pol III synthesizes DNA at about 1000 nucleotides per second.  (This animation is a "super-slow motion" version of the real events, i.e. ~15 nucleotides/min.) &lt;/html&gt;

        <text>&lt;html&gt;After a segment of DNA has been replicated, the ~1 kbase DNA-RNA fragments (Okasaki fragments) on the lagging strand are modified by removal of the RNA segments and joining of the fragments to produce a continuous DNA strand.  The 5'-->3' exonuclease activity of Pol I removes the RNA primers. The nucleotide monophosphates are released and recycled. 
            The resulting small gap is filled-in by the 5'-->3' polymerase activity of Pol I. When Dna Pol I dissociates, all base pairs are formed, but there is still an unformed phosphodiester bond. DNA ligase binds to this "nick" and "seals" it using energy from ATP (or NAD+) hydrolysis. &lt;/html&gt;
