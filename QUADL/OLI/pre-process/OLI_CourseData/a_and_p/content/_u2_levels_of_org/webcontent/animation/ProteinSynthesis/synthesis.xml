        <text>&lt;html&gt;This animation depicts the stages of translation (protein synthesis) in prokaryotic organisms. The basic steps are the same in eukaryotic organism. The actual synthesis of a polypeptide involves three distinct phases:
    &lt;b&gt;Initiation:&lt;/b&gt; The mRNA, f-Met charged tRNA, and the 30s subunit form an initiation complex.  This complex then recruits the 50s subunit to form the 70s particle.
    &lt;b&gt;Elongation:&lt;/b&gt; Additional amino acids are added to the growing polypeptide chain.
    &lt;b&gt;Termination:&lt;/b&gt; The presence of a stop codon in the mRNA signals termination of the process and release of the completed polypeptide chain.&lt;/html&gt;

    <step stepURL="swfs/initiation1.swf" menustep="   Initiation 1">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;Formation of the 30S initiation complex starts with the mRNA, an &lt;b&gt;Initiation Factor&lt;/b&gt; and the small (30S) subunit of the ribosome. In prokaryotic organisms the alignment for specific binding of the mRNA to the small (30S) subunit of the ribosome is accomplished through the recognition of the &lt;b&gt;Shine-Dalgarno sequence&lt;/b&gt; on the mRNA and coordinate binding with an initiation factor.&lt;/html&gt;

    </step>
    <step stepURL="swfs/initiation2.swf" menustep="   Initiation 2">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;GTP hydrolysis provides the energy for the binding of the fMet-tRNA complex through its anti-codon sequence to the complementary start codon on the mRNA that is bound to the 30S subunit of the ribosome. This is accompanied by the loss of the initiation factor. This completes the formation of the &lt;b&gt;"30S initiation complex"&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;
        </text>
    </step>
    <step stepURL="swfs/initiation3.swf" menustep="   Initiation 3">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;The initiation factors function to prevent the association of the large (50S) and small (30S) subunits of the ribosome when translation is not occurring With the loss of the initiation factor in the previous step, the 50S ribosomal subunit joins the complex to form the &lt;b&gt;"70S initiation complex"&lt;/b&gt;. The fMet-tRNA is hydrogen bonded to the start codon on the mRNA and occupies the P or peptidyl site on the 70S complex. This complex is now ready to bind the second charged aminoacyl-tRNA.&lt;/html&gt;

    <step stepURL="swfs/elongation1.swf" menustep="   Elongation 1">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;Using energy from the hydrolysis of GTP, the second charged tRNA whose anticodon is complementary to the second triplet codon on the message (mRNA) binds to the mRNA and occupies the A (Aminoacyl-tRNA site or Acceptor site) on the 70S complex. &lt;/html&gt;
        </text>
    </step>
    <step stepURL="swfs/elongation2.swf" menustep="   Elongation 2">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;With fMet-tRNA in the P site and the next charged aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site, peptidyl transfer occurs without any additional energy input, e.g. ATP or GTP hydrolysis. Peptidyl transfer involves exchange of the ester bond attaching the fMet amino acid to the fMet-tRNA in the P site to form a peptide bond with the alpha amino group of the amino acid attached to the charged aminoacyl-tRNA occupying the A site. After this process, the newly formed peptide chain is found in the A-site.&lt;/html&gt;
        </text>
    </step>
    <step stepURL="swfs/elongation3.swf" menustep="   Elongation 3">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;The next step involves the &lt;b&gt;translocation&lt;/b&gt; of the mRNA along the ribosome moving the newly formed peptide chain to the P site. Translocation requires the action of several specific proteins and the hydrolysis of GTP. The result is the movement of the newly-formed peptidyl-tRNA to the P-site and the corresponding movement of the uncharged tRNA to the E-site, from which it quickly dissociates. The complex now has an open A-site which binds the next charged-tRNA corresponding to the next triplet codon on the mRNA.&lt;/html&gt;

        <text>&lt;html&gt;This process continues until the stop signal is reached.  The addition of each amino acid requires the hydrolysis of two GTP molecules, one for loading of the charged tRNA and one for translocation, or moving, of the ribosome.&lt;/html&gt;

    <step stepURL="swfs/termination1.swf" menustep="   Termination 1">
        <text>&lt;html&gt;A protein called the release factor binds to the stop codon on the mRNA.&lt;/html&gt;</text>

    <step stepURL="swfs/termination2.swf" menustep="   Termination 2">
        <text>The &lt;b&gt;release factor&lt;/b&gt; allows water to hydrolyze the bond between the finished peptide and the last tRNA molecule.  Then the entire complex dissociates, releasing the completed peptide.&lt;/html&gt;</text>
