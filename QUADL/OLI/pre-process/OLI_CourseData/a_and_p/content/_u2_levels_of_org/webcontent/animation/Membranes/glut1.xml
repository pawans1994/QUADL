        <text>&lt;html&gt;Glucose is an essential substrate for the metabolism of most cells. Because glucose is a polar molecule, its transport through biological membranes requires specific transporter proteins. Down here the structure of the glut1 transporter from diffrent views.&lt;/html&gt;

        <text>&lt;html&gt;The Glucose molecules in this example are too large to freely pass through the membrane.  This Glucose Transporter allows them through the specific channel through the protein. &lt;/html&gt;
