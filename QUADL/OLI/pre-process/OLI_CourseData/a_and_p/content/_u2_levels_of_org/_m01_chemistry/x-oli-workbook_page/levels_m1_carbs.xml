        <p>Carbohydrates, also called saccharides, are the simplest macromolecules. All
            carbohydrates are comprised of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms, with the
            chemical formula C<sub>m</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub> (hence carbon plus
            hydrate). This represents a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms (as in water), but in this case, they are attached to a carbon backbone.
            The constituent atoms of carbohydrate can be configured in virtually endless
            configurations, so carbohydrate molecules come in a multitude of different
            shapes and sizes. Carbohydrate modifications (called glycosylations) are present
            on lipid membranes and proteins for specialized finction and recognition. Unique
            carbohydrate conformations allow even more specificity to a protein, beyond just
            the amino-acid code. The outer membrane of the cell is dotted with carbohydrate
            chains, which differ according to cell type. These carbohydrate glycosylations
            provide a "signature" of the cell and, whe expressed transiently, can also act
            as a signal. Thus, glycosylations are important in immune response and general
            cell-cell communication.</p>
        <p>Carbohydrates are best known as energy storage molecules. Cells readily convert
            carbohydrates into usable energy. Table sugar, or sucrose, is the best-known
            carbohydrate. However, the body does not need dietary carbodydrates for energy.
            Proteins and fats can meet the bodyâ€™s energy needs, and the body can convert
            molecules into carbohydrates needed for other cellular functions. But
            carbohydrates require minimal processing for use as energy. For example, a
            simple enzymatic reaction converts sucrose into blood sugar, or glucose, which
            can be used directly as a source of cellular energy.</p>
