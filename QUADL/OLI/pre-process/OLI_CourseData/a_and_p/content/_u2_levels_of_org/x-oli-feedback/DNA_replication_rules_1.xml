      <prompt><em>Question:</em> Examine the illustration of the end of the chromosome with the
        different length strands resulting from the replication. If the rules for DNA polymerase
        directed synthesis are observed, to which strand would DNA polymerase want to add dNTPs?
        What would it need to satisfy the substrate requirement for DNA polymerase to conduct the
        synthesis?</prompt>
