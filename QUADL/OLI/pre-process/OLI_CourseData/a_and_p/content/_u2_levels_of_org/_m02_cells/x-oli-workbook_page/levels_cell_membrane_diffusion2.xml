To allow these molecules, which are not soluble in the lipid bilayer, to pass across the hydrophobic barrier it is necessary to provide ports, channels or holes through the membrane. The molecules will still move spontaneously down a concentration gradient from high to low concentration. Some of these channels can remain open at all times, allowing the molecules to move freely according to the concentration gradient. Others can be gated channels that open and close in response to the needs of the cell. In most cases these channels are very discriminatory and will only allow specific molecules to pass. The process of moving impermeable molecules across a membrane (down their concentration gradients) using channels or pores is referred to as facilitated diffusion. Because the molecules are moving down a concentration gradient, the process is driven by simple diffusion and does not require the input of additional energy from the cell. </p><wb:inline idref="_u3_m2_facilitated_diffusion_DIGT" purpose="didigetthis" /></body><bib:file /></workbook_page>
