        <p>Without metabolism, life would not be able to divert energy to overcome entropy –
            the tendency to disorder. Broadly speaking it is the entire set of chemical
            reactions that allow organisms to maintain homeostasis. One of the key roles of
            metabolism is to harvest energy from food. The body uses this energy to drive
            chemical reactions necessary for various cellular processes. Digestive processes
            convert food into the simple sugar glucose, which is then broken down via a
            complex chemical process – the citric acid cycle. At various points in the
            cycle, oxygen is used from respiration to incorporate the energy from glucose
            into a nucleotide molecule, adenosine triphosphate or ATP. The ATP produced via
            this process of glycolysis is the molecular currency that runs the cellular
            economy. Catabolism, the breakdown of complex molecules, provides the energy for
            anabolism, synthesizing of complex molecules from simple precursors, and hence
            the continuation and cycles of life.</p>
