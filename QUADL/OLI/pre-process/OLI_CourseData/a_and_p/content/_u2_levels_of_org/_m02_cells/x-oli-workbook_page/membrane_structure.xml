It is a dynamic structure that allows for the lateral movement of phospholipids and proteins. Fluidity is a term used to describe the ease of movement of molecules in the membrane and is an important characteristic for cell function. Fluidity is dependent on the temperature (increased temperatures increase fluidity and decreased temperatures decrease fluidity), and the concentrations of saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids make the membrane less fluid while unsaturated fatty acids make it more fluid. The correct ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids keeps the membrane fluid at any temperature conducive to life. For example, winter wheat responds to decreasing temperatures by increasing the amount of unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes to prevent the cell membrane from becoming too &quot;stiff&quot; in the cold. In animal cells, cholesterol helps to prevent the packing of fatty acid tails and thus lowers the requirement of unsaturated fatty acids. This helps maintain the fluid nature of the cell membrane without it becoming too liquid at body temperature. </p><p id="afc82843124ab4a61b383c475c8fcf480">Membranes are not static sheets of molecules locked rigidly in place. The lipids in the membrane are in random bulk flow moving about 22 Âµm (micrometers) per second. Phospholipids freely move in the same layer of the membrane and rarely flip to the other layer. Flipping of phospholipids from one layer to the other rarely occurs because flipping requires the hydrophilic head to pass through the hydrophobic region of the bilayer.</p><section id="acfeae3d3d9545e5ae518e4905c892e1" purpose="learnbydoing"><title> </title><body><wb:inline idref="bilayer_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing" /></body></section></body><bib:file /></workbook_page>
