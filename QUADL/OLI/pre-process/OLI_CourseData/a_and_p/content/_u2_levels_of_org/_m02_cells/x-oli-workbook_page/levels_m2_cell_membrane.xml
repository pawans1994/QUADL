        <p>The plasma membrane is the boundary of the cell; it determines what enters and exits the cell, and how it interacts with its environment.  Cells are surrounded by fluid, termed extracellular or interstitial fluid.  This fluid contains thousands of substances and the cell needs to be choosy about what it allows in and out through its cell membrane.  Cell membranes only allow some molecules through.  This characteristic is why cell membranes are selectively permeable.  They are not impermeable (they don’t let anything pass) nor are they freely permeable (everything can pass).  This quality allows a cell to control what enters and exits it.  </p>
        
        <p>The phospholipid bilayer is the main fabric of the membrane. The bilayer's structure causes the membrane to be semi-permeable. The hydrophobic core blocks the diffusion of hydrophilic ions and polar molecules. Small hydrophobic molecules and gases, which can dissolve in the membrane's core, cross it with ease.
            
            Other molecules require proteins to transport them across the membrane. Proteins determine most of the membrane's specific functions. The plasma membrane and the membranes of the various organelles each have unique collections of proteins. For example, to date more than 50 kinds of proteins have been found in the plasma membrane of red blood cells.</p>
        <!--<p>The diversity of life began when membranes enclosed packets of self-replicating
            molecules, thus providing a protected medium buffered against environmental changes
            outside. Besides enclosing the cell, membranes act as guardians of the cell, permitting
            passage of molecules in and out. Membranes also serve within the cell as the structural
            components of organelles. Membranes are typically comprised of two layers of lipid fat.
            Most proteins interact with membranes in some way. Within the layers, often stretching
            across, are embedded proteins and other macromolecules. These proteins govern much of
            the cell’s interaction with its environment. Malfunctions in membrane proteins can have
            severe consequences. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by a gene mutation that
            impairs functioning of a chloride ion channel protein. Membranes also harbor other
            molecules, such as carbohydrates, which play a role in immune responses.</p>-->

                <p>The cell membrane provides a
                    semi<?oxy_delete author="michellemyers" timestamp="20120416T120245-0400" content="-"?>permeable
                    barrier between the inside and the outside of the cell. This barrier provides
                    control for transport of nutrients, ions and signals between the highly variable
                    outside environment and the relatively well-defined interior of the cell. This
                    section of the course will explore the ways in which molecules can pass across
                    the membrane (diffusion and active transport), can be transported into the cell
                    without passing across the membrane (endocytosis), and can send signals for
                    actions within the cell without actually passing across the membrane themselves
                    (signal transduction).</p>
