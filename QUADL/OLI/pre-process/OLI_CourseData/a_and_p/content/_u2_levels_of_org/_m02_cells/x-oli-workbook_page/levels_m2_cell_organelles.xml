        <p>The diversity of life began when membranes enclosed packets of self-replicating
            molecules, thus providing a protected medium buffered against environmental
            changes outside. Besides enclosing the cell, membranes act as guardians of the
            cell, permitting passage of molecules in and out. Membranes also serve within
            the cell as the structural components of organelles. Membranes are typically
            comprised of two layers of lipid fat. Most proteins interact with membranes in
            some way. Within the layers, often stretching across, are embedded proteins and
            other macromolecules. These proteins govern much of the cellâ€™s interaction with
            its environment. Malfunctions in membrane proteins can have severe consequences.
            For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by a gene mutation that impairs
            functioning of a chloride ion channel protein. Membranes harbor other molecules,
            such as carbohydrates, which play role in immune responses.</p>
