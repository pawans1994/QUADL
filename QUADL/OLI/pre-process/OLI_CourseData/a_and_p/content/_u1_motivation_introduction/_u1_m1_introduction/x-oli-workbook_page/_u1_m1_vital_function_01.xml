        <p>In this section, you will be introduced to the major organ systems of the body. To put
            these systems in context, we will first discuss vital functions of life.</p>
        <p>Within any organism, there are a multitude of functions taking place at any given time.
            Humans, for example, can breathe, talk, digest food, process visual images, and move
            their bodies all at the same time. While all of these activities are important, some are
            essential to the survival of the human body itself. They are <extra><anchor><term>vital
                functions</term></anchor> <p>Our body's anatomy and physiology works together to perform the vital functions that keep us alive</p></extra> - processes or actions of the body on which life is directly dependent.
            You will examine four main vital functions in this course: exchange
            with the environment; transport within the body; structure, support, and movement; and
            control and regulation.</p>
        
        <p>For human life, there are several vital functions. </p>
