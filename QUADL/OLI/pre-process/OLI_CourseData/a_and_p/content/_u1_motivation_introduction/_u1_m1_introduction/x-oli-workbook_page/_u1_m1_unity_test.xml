        <p>In this course, you will encounter a number of 3-D interactive models. These were created
            for this course by graphics design students from the Fayetteville Technical Community
            College in North Carolina for the purpose of increasing your practice and retention of
            course terminology and concepts. In order to take advantage of these models, your internet browser
            must have the Unity plugin. If you haven't already, visit the course Test and
            Configure page.  Doing so will ensure that you have all of the software needed for this
            course. </p>
        <p>A specific set of instructions will be provided as you encounter these models throughout
            the course, but for now, if you can see and interact with the image below, you are ready
            to advance to the following pages to begin your journey into Anatomy and Physiology.</p>
