This section will discuss the structures the human body needs to compartmentalize and protect these vital components and the structures that enable the body to move to obtain nutrients and avoid predators. Organ systems are required to coordinate these many efforts.</p><p id="bf9fb3b01f25453db2b6277f53d384bd">Maintenance of a consistent physical structure is important for the body to function efficiently. Support and structure are among the primary functions of the <term>integumentary</term> system, the <term>skeletal</term> system and the <term>muscular</term> system. These organ systems also allow the body to move in response to internal and external stimuli.</p></body></workbook_page>
