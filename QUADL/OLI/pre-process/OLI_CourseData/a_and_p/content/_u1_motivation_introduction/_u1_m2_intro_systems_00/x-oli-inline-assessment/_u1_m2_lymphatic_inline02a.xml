Immune cells and other blood cells originate in red bone marrow; some mature in red bone marrow while others move to thymus to mature before moving to other structures in the body.</feedback></response><response match="maturation" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Secondary lymphoid organs, such as nodes and spleen, have this function. </feedback></response><response match="lymph_fluid" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Lymph fluid collects from tissue fluid and moves to secondary lymph organs through lymph vessels.</feedback></response><response match="no_function" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Red bone marrow has a very important function in producing immune cells.</feedback></response><hint>People taking anti-cancer drugs often have greatly decreased bone marrow activity, leading to a poorly functioning immune system. </hint></part></question></page></assessment>
