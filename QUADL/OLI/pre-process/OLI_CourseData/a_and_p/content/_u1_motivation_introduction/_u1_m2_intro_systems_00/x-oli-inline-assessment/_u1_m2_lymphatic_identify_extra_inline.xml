The spleen is the largest lymphatic organ in the body and filters cell debris from blood.</feedback></response><response input="spleen" match="lymph_node" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Lymph nodes are similar in structure to this organ, but are much smaller than the organ you are asked to identify, and they are distributed throughout the body. </feedback></response><response input="spleen" match="thymus" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The thymus is in the upper part of the body.</feedback></response><response input="spleen" match="tonsils" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The tonsils are superior to the organ you are asked to identify.</feedback></response><hint targets="spleen">This is the only major immune organ in the abdomen.</hint><hint targets="spleen">Immune and lymph organs tend to be small, except for the spleen. The tonsils, adenoids and thymus are all in the upper part of the body. </hint></part><part id="I_u1_m2_lymphatic_extra_spleen_p2" score_out_of="1"><skillref idref="_u1_describe_lymphatic_function_SKILL" /><response input="lymphocytes" match="lymphocytes" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Lymphocytes (white blood cells) are stored in the spleen, ready to defend the body against particular foreign microorganisms.</feedback></response><response input="lymphocytes" match="red_blood_cells" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The spleen removes aged and damaged red blood cells (erythrocytes) from the blood.</feedback></response><response input="lymphocytes" match="lymph_fluids" score="0"><feedback>Not quite. Lymph fluids pass through the spleen, but are not stored there.</feedback></response><hint targets="lymphocytes">These mature in the primary lymphatic organs: the red bone marrow and the thymus.</hint></part><part id="I_u1_m2_lymphatic_extra_spleen_p3" score_out_of="1"><skillref idref="_u1_describe_lymphatic_function_SKILL" /><response input="specific_immunity" match="specific_immunity" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Lymphocytes collect in the spleen to provide specific immunity for pathogens in the blood.</feedback></response><response input="specific_immunity" match="pathogens" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Pathogens are disease-causing microorganisms (germs) that are destroyed by lymphocytes clustered in the spleen.</feedback></response><response input="specific_immunity" match="red_blood_cells" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Lymphocytes are white blood cells. Old red blood cells are removed from the blood by phagocytes resident in the spleen.</feedback></response><response input="specific_immunity" match="non_specific_immunity" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Lymphocytes in the spleen defend the body against particular antigens. </feedback></response><hint targets="specific_immunity">This describes the bodyâ€™s defense against particular diseased or foreign microorganisms. </hint></part></question></page><page><question id="I_u1_m2_lymphatic_extra_tonsils"><body><image alt="Diagram of Lymphatic System" src="../webcontent/Lymphatic_1C.jpg" width="156" height="350" /><p>The arrow in the image above points to which organ? <input_ref input="tonsils" /></p><p>Classified as a <input_ref input="secondary" /> lymphoid organ, this organ traps antigens entering the body through the mouth and nasal cavity, where <input_ref input="mature" /> lymphocytes destroy the invading microorganisms.</p></body><fill_in_the_blank id="tonsils"><choice value="adenoids">adenoids</choice><choice value="spleen">spleen</choice><choice value="tonsils">tonsils</choice><choice value="thymus">thymus</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank id="secondary"><choice value="primary">primary</choice><choice value="hard_working">hard-working</choice><choice value="secondary">secondary</choice></fill_in_the_blank><fill_in_the_blank id="mature"><choice value="colorful">colorful</choice><choice value="mature">mature</choice><choice value="new">new</choice></fill_in_the_blank><part id="I_u1_m2_lymphatic_extra_tonsils_p1" score_out_of="1"><skillref idref="_u1_describe_lymphatic_structure_SKILL" /><response input="tonsils" match="tonsils" score="1"><feedback>Correct. The tonsils are masses of lymphoid tissues that form a ring at the back of the nose and mouth cavity where the pharynx connects. </feedback></response><response input="tonsils" match="adenoids" score="0"><feedback>Not quite. The adenoids work together with the tonsils to filter ingested and inhaled material. </feedback></response><response input="tonsils" match="spleen" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The spleen is in the abdomen.</feedback></response><response input="tonsils" match="thymus" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The thymus is near the organ you are asked to identify, but is located near the trachea.</feedback></response><hint targets="tonsils">Some children who have lots of infections in their throat have to have these organs removed.</hint></part><part id="I_u1_m2_lymphatic_extra_tonsils_p2" score_out_of="1"><skillref idref="_u1_describe_lymphatic_function_SKILL" /><response input="secondary" match="secondary" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Fully developed white cells collect in the tonsils ready to defend the body against infectious and foreign microorganisms.</feedback></response><response input="secondary" match="primary" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Bone marrow and the thymus are the primary lymphoid organs where lymphocytes develop.</feedback></response><response input="secondary" match=" hard_working" score="0"><feedback>This is not the best answer, although the tonsils do provide a first line of defense against pathogens entering the mouth and nasal cavity and consequently are subject to chronic infections. </feedback></response><hint targets="secondary">These organs are next after the most important organs, which develop the immune cells.</hint></part><part id="I_u1_m2_lymphatic_extra_tonsils_p3" score_out_of="1"><skillref idref="_u1_describe_lymphatic_function_SKILL" /><response input="mature" match="mature" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Lymphocytes are generated in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus. After these white blood cells fully develop, they circulate to the tonsils, spleen and other lymphoid organs. </feedback></response><response input="mature" match="new" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Fully developed immune cells are needed to destroy pathogens.</feedback></response><response input="mature" match="colorful" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Lymphocytes, though, are called white blood cells.</feedback></response><hint targets="mature">After the cells are fully formed.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
