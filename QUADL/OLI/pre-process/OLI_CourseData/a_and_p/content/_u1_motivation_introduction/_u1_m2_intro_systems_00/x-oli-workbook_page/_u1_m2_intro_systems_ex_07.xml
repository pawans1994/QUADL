            <title>Lymphatic System and Immunity - Function</title>
            <body>
                <p>Our body is in constant exchange with the environment, through breathing,
                    eating<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20111031T134709-0400" content=","?>
                    and other activities. Therefore, it is important to screen the body and its
                    components regularly to identify foreign invaders that might enter during these
                    activities (or in any other manner). Further, it is important to rapidly and
                    effectively remove these invaders before they can cause significant harm. Our
                    body has specialized transport systems to carry out these functions. The
                    cardiovascular and lymphatic systems work together to transport excess fluids
                    (blood and lymph fluid, respectively) away from body tissues. Once fluid enters
                    the lymphatic system it is termed lymph. Lymph travels through lymph vessels and
                    passes through many lymph nodes which filter and clean the lymph. The immune
                    system also produces and matures immune cells, which protect the body from
                    invasion by agents that cause disease. One additional function of the lymphatic
                    system is to transport absorbed fat from the digestive system to the body
                    cells.</p>

                <p>The immune system coordinates the activities required to respond to disease and
                    infection. This response can provide two types of immunity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><term>Specific immunity</term>, in which specialized cells (such as T and B
                        cells) recognize specific foreign molecules called antigens within the body
                        and respond to them. </li>
                    <li><term>Nonspecific immunity</term>, in which the body uses several general
                        methods such as physical barriers (that is, the skin and mucous membranes),
                        fever, inflammation, specific action by immune cells, and enzyme activity to
                        protect itself against general harmful agents. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The major organs of the lymphatic and immune systems (described below) can be
                    classified based on their role in lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell)
                    maturation. Maturation of lymphocytes takes place within the red bone marrow and
                    the thymus gland, which are primary lymphoid organs. Antigens become trapped
                    within secondary lymphoid organs such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and tonsils.
                    These organs are sites that contain lymphocytes for destruction of invading
                    pathogens. </p>

                <p>While many people know that we are protected from foreign micro-organisms by an
                    immune system, few people realize how the immune system is able to patrol the
                    entire body. White blood cells of the immune system are produced in the red bone
                    marrow and travel through the blood. They can leave blood capillaries to travel
                    through tissues. White blood cells are then able to remove dead or damaged cells
                    and "foreign" organisms they encounter and recognize specific foreign organisms
                    again if necessary. Additionally, lymph collects from tissues and circulates
                    through lymph vessels, making "rest stops" in discrete points throughout the
                    body called lymph nodes or lymph organs. In these nodes and organs, including
                    the spleen, tonsils and other tissue clusters, there are large collections of
                    white blood immune cells. Lymph slowly travels through these organs ensuring
                    that the lymphocytes have plenty of time to react to these foreign organisms in
                    the lymph before returning it to the blood.</p>

                <p>The lymph nodes are located in several regions along the path of lymphatic
                    vessels in our body. The thymus is located within the upper chest, lies
                    posterior to the upper portion of the sternum, and extends from the root of the
                    neck onto the pericardium. The spleen is found in the upper left abdominal
                    cavity; it lies superior, posterior, and lateral to the stomach. The tonsils are
                    masses of lymphatic tissue within the nasopharyngeal (nose and mouth) region. </p>

            <p> <em>Integration of Systems:</em> The cardiovascular, lymphatic, and immune
            systems coordinate a diverse set of transport functions. The cardiovascular
            system ensures that nutrients are delivered to cells in an appropriate amount of
            time, and that wastes are adequately removed. To ensure that the delivered blood
            is not compromised, the immune and lymphatic systems work together to respond to
            foreign invasion in multiple ways. Through the coordinated efforts of the
            systems, the body can maintain fluid balance and proper functioning. </p>
            
                <p><em>Integration of systems:</em> Most of the systems in the body are
                    interconnected. The respiratory system is tightly integrated with the
                    circulatory system: oxygen brought into the lungs transfers to the blood cells
                    in the circulatory system to be delivered to the body. Similarly the blood moves
                    nutrients absorbed from the digestive system. Nerves control muscles, muscles
                    act against bones. The lymph system moves fluids through the body to prevent
                    fluid buildup in tissues. Also, the fluid passes through immune nodes and organs
                    to clean out dead cells and foreign organisms. </p>
               
                <p><em>Nodes versus glands:</em> In the lymph system, there are many lymph nodes.
                    Nodes are collections of cells that lymph fluid flows through. They act as
                    sieves or traps, but in a relatively passive manner. In comparison, a gland is a
                    collection of cells that secretes chemicals: hormones, proteins, etc. </p>
