            <title>Urinary System - Function</title>
            <body>
                <p>The urinary system filters blood and adjusts the composition of
                    blood/interstitial fluid by removing excess water, salt, acid, and metabolic
                    waste from the body as urine. This allows the urinary system to control body
                    fluid volume, blood pressure, pH, and electrolyte balance. It is a critical
                    system for maintaining homeostasis.</p>

                <p>We have seen how the digestive and respiratory systems remove some wastes from
                    the body—undigested food leaves the digestive tract through the anus and carbon
                    dioxide leaves through the lungs and airways. The urinary system (or excretory
                    system) filters blood to remove excess water, electrolytes and other metabolic
                    wastes and reabsorbs water, electrolytes and other molecules as needed to
                    maintain homeostasis in the body fluid. The resulting excess and wastes are
                    excreted as urine. In this way, the urinary system also works with the
                    respiratory system to maintain pH balance in the body.</p>

            <body>

                <p>The organs of the urinary system include:</p>
                <!--comment here-->
                <ul>
                    <li>Kidneys</li>
                    <li>Ureters</li>
                    <li>Urinary Bladder</li>
                    <li>Urethra </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The <term>kidneys</term>, the main organs of the urinary system, are located
                    against the posterior wall of the abdomen. They serve as a filtration and
                    reabsorption system, where soluble substances are filtered and then those that
                    the body needs to keep are reabsorbed. Those that are not reabsorbed (or not
                    reabsorbed fully), such as our metabolic waste products, end up in the urine.
                    Because our bodies are constantly producing wastes, the kidneys continuously
                    work to prevent the buildup of waste products and toxins, filtering about 180
                    liters of fluid a day. Because the average person has about three liters of
                    plasma (the fluid fraction of blood), this means that our plasma is filtered
                    about 60 times a day! </p>

                <p>One of the most important of the waste products removed from the blood is urea,
                    the main end product of protein metabolism. Other waste products and some toxins
                    are also removed from the blood by the kidneys.</p>

                <p>In addition, ions and water are also filtered by the kidneys, but a large
                    fraction of these are reabsorbed to keep the fluid and electrolyte concentration
                    of the blood and other body fluids within an optimal range for proper cell
                    function. The kidneys also play an important role in the regulation of pH by
                    managing the amount of acid in the urine. </p>

                <p>As previously described the kidneys filter the blood to form urine. Urine leaves the kidneys and flows through the <extra>

                    </extra>. On average, two liters of urine are produced per day, but this can
                    vary greatly depending upon fluid intake, fluid loss through perspiration, and
                    other factors. </p>

               <p> <em>Integration of Systems:</em> Our body removes waste through the digestive system, the
                            respiratory system and the urinary system. In the digestive system, the
                            excreted waste is typically food materials that cannot be digested or
                            absorbed. We exhale carbon dioxide, which is a metabolic waste product.
                            We use the urinary system to get rid of all of the other metabolic
                            by-products, toxins and salts that are not needed in the body and can be
                            toxic. The two kidneys filter the blood in the bloodstream and
                            concentrate the material to be excreted as urine. </p>
                
                <p><em>Water as a solvent:</em> One of the amazing aspects of water is that it is
                    considered a universal solvent because many substances easily dissolve in water.
                    Water is used to transport materials through the body; for example, the plasma
                    fraction of blood is mostly water that contains ions, proteins and other
                    dissolved substances. </p>
               
                <p><em>Homeostasis of water:</em> Homeostasis is the process of regulating a value
                    around a set<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20111031T123155-0400"?>
                    <?oxy_insert_end?>point. In the case of water regulation, the amount of water
                    leaving the body as urine can be adjusted for variable amounts of water coming
                    into the body. The kidney, in response to hormones, is the main organ for
                    determining how much will leave the body, and therefore plays an important role
                    in water level
                    homeostasis.<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20111031T123421-0400" content="."?>
                    The brain also has receptors that monitor fluid and electrolyte levels,
                    stimulating us to get thirsty. </p>
                
                <p><em>Homeostasis of electrolytes:</em> Most people know about the
                    kidney<?oxy_delete author="mmyers" timestamp="20111031T123735-0400" content="’"?>s<?oxy_insert_start author="mmyers" timestamp="20111031T123741-0400"?>'<?oxy_insert_end?>
                    function in producing urine, but many don’t realize that in the process of
                    forming urine the kidney plays a critical role by selectively reabsorbing some
                    electrolytes to maintain appropriate ion levels in the blood. Urine is usually
                    acidic because of selective secretion of metabolically generated acids to
                    maintain an appropriate pH level in the blood. </p>
