The kidneys are not above the spinal column. The spinal column runs between the kidneys.</feedback></response><response match="lateral" score="1"><feedback>Correct. The kidneys are located on either side of the spinal column; the spinal column is located between the kidneys. The right kidney is usually slightly lower than the left. Its close proximity to the liver pushes the right kidney downward. </feedback></response><response match="inferior" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The kidneys are not below the spinal column. The spinal column is between the kidneys.</feedback></response><response match="proximal" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Proximal means inward toward the trunk. The kidneys are lateral to (on the sides of) the spinal column.</feedback></response><no_response score="0"><feedback>Please try to answer the question.</feedback></no_response><hint>The two kidneys are equally distant from the spinal column.</hint><hint>The spinal column is bisected by the midsagittal plane.</hint></part></question><question id="_u1_m2_urinary03"><body>Urine travels in what direction from the kidney through the ureter to the bladder? </body><multiple_choice id="ans" shuffle="false"><choice value="superior">superior</choice><choice value="inferior">inferior</choice><choice value="proximal">proximal</choice><choice value="deep">deep</choice></multiple_choice><part id="_u1_m2_urinary03_p1"><skillref idref="_u1_orientation_direction_SKILL" /><skillref idref="_u1_describe_urinary_structure_SKILL" /><response match="inferior" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Urine travels down from the kidneys through the ureters into the bladder. </feedback></response><response match="superior" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This would mean that the urine moves up toward the head. </feedback></response><response match="proximal" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Proximal means towards the trunk; that is, further into the body from the extremities. Urine starts flowing from the kidneys through the ureters downward to the bladder.</feedback></response><response match="deep" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.
