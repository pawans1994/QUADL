The pharynx is the region between the mouth and the trachea. </feedback></response><response input="nose_mouth" match="trachea" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The trachea is inferior to the structure you are trying to label.</feedback></response><response input="nose_mouth" match="mouth" score="0"><feedback>Close, but not the best choice. The mouth alone is only one of the two organs comprising this structure, both of which provide ways for air to enter the body.</feedback></response><hint targets="nose_mouth">This is/these are the structures through which air enters the body.</hint></part><part id="I_u1_m2_respiratory_extra_mouth_p2" score_out_of="1"><skillref idref="_u1_describe_respiratory_function_SKILL" /><response input="inhale_air" match="inhale_air" score="1"><feedback>Correct. We inhale air and exhale carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth.</feedback></response><response input="inhale_air" match="take_in_food" score="0"><feedback>This is not quite right. While we do take in food and beverages through the mouth, breathing is hindered if food or liquids enter the nose. </feedback></response><response input="inhale_air" match="express_ourself" score="0"><feedback>This is not the best choice. Air enters the nose and mouth and passes through to the larynx, which contains the vocal cords that enable speech. However, this question is focused on metabolism and the exchange of gases.</feedback></response><hint targets="inhale_air">We do this when we breathe air into our body.</hint></part><part id="I_u1_m2_respiratory_extra_mouth_p3" score_out_of="1"><skillref idref="_u1_describe_respiratory_function_SKILL" /><response input="humidified_filtered" match="humidified_filtered" score="1"><feedback>Correct. We breathe air in through the nose and mouth, where the process of moisturizing, cleansing, and separating the gases begins.</feedback></response><response input="humidified_filtered" match="digested" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Air enters the nose and mouth, where it is filtered, humidified, and then directed through the pharynx to the interior of the respiratory system. You probably consider the mouth more for eating; food and water that enter the mouth pass through the pharynx on the way to the digestive system. But it is also used for breathing.</feedback></response><response input="humidified_filtered" match="thought_about" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.

The lungs are the primary organs where oxygen is exchanged into the blood.</feedback></response><response input="lungs" match="pharnyx" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The structures we are looking for are inferior to the pharynx and larynx. </feedback></response><response input="lungs" match="nose_mouth" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. These are structures that take in air, and start the process of cleansing and humidifying it. </feedback></response><response input="lungs" match="bronchi_alveoli" score="0"><feedback>This answer is close, but not the best choice. The lungs contain the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli, which are conduits that help carry oxygen to the places where gas is exchanged. </feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
