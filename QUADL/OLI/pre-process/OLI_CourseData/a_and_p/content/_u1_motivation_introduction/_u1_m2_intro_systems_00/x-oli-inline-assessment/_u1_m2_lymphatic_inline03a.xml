Yes, they are important nonspecific immune cells that will try to engulf anything they recognize as foreign.</feedback></response><response match="antibodies" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Secreting antibodies is the job of certain lymphocytes in the specific immune system. </feedback></response><response match="lymphocytes" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Macrophages are a mature cell form. They are a mature form of monocytes. </feedback></response><response match="one_type_of_bacteria" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.
