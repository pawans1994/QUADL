It&apos;s true that if the muscle cannot contract, the bone will not move. But that&apos;s not all that will happen. </feedback></response><response match="v3" score="0"><feedback>This is not the best answer.

This is the best choice. The autonomic nervous system controls the automatic functions of the internal organs. It is, therefore, also called the involuntary nervous system. </feedback></response><response match="v1" score="0"><feedback>Not quite. This is correct, but there is also another correct answer. </feedback></response><response match="v2" score="0"><feedback>Not quite. This is correct, but there is also another correct answer.</feedback></response><response match="v3" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. You consciously control your fingers. </feedback></response><response match="v4" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is a tricky one. We typically donâ€™t think about our breathing pattern, as it is controlled by some automatic (though not autonomic) nervous circuits. But we can override this automatic function if we decide to hold our breath, etc. </feedback></response><response match="v6" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Movement of the fingers and, to some extent, breathing, are actions consciously controlled with skeletal muscles. The autonomic nervous system controls the involuntary actions of the internal organs.</feedback></response><hint>If the function is carried out by skeletal muscle, it is not autonomic. </hint></part></question></page></assessment>
