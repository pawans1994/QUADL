				<p>To create a pullout, use normal paragraph text, but assign a background color for the text that spans the entire width of the page. Making the background color span the entire width seems to be a little flaky, and may be browser-dependent (it works in Firefox), so we may have to change this at some point. For now, you can copy and paste this one into your own document. The pullout must be begin with the pullout type with no spaces and a colon (NOTE:, TOSUMUP:)</p>
