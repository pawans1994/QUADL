        <p>The <term>adrenal glands</term> help regulate the body’s response to stress, controlling
            blood pressure, and maintaining the body’s water, sodium, and potassium levels. The
            adrenal glands are associated with the pair of kidneys which are retroperitoneal and
            lateral to the spinal column ; one gland is located on the superior surface of each
            kidney (hence they are also known as suprarenal glands). The adrenal glands consist of
            an outer adrenal cortex (cortex means outer layer) and an inner adrenal medulla (medulla
            means middle). Functionally and anatomically the adrenal gland is really two glands
            packaged together. The cells of the cortex are endocrine and those of the medulla are
            neurosecretory. The cells look very different and embryologically they come from
            different tissues. These regions secrete different hormones: the adrenal cortex produces
            steroid hormones, and the adrenal medulla produces catecholamine hormones.</p>
