The testes produce androgens, testosterone being the most prominent. Testosterone stimulates the development of male secondary sex characteristics and the production of sperm cells. The testes also produce the hormone inhibin, which inhibits the release of the tropic hormone from the anterior pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) needed for the development of sperm (spermatogenesis).</p><p id="d01d544995b041dcb6c78ac4d1080de6">The ovaries produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which stimulate the development of female secondary sex characteristics, regulate the menstrual cycle, and prepare the body for childbirth. The ovaries also produce the hormone inhibin, which inhibits the release of FSH. </p><p id="e678800f287a45c5ac19db89962d8e95">The placenta, which supplies the necessary nutrients to the fetus, is also an endocrine organ. It synthesizes and secretes a number of hormones that are crucial for the maintenance of pregnancy. The <term>human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG)</term>, that is the basis of urine pregnancy tests is another of the placental hormones. As the fetus develops, the placenta takes over the production of estrogen and progesterone to maintain pregnancy. The high level of estrogen facilitates the growth of the uterus and the mammary glands during gestation. Progesterone is important in suppressing maternal immune response towards the fetus and inhibiting uterine smooth muscle contraction. The placenta also produces <term>relaxin</term>, that affects collagen metabolism and softens the pubic symphysis to facilitate birthing. It also produces <term>lactogen</term>, which is structurally similar to prolactin and growth hormone (pituitary hormones), but its role, if any, in human lactation is still being investigated.</p><image id="e0e46e2037824220b444fc9bab1871ef" src="../webcontent/E_M1_16.jpg" alt="detail view of ovaries and testes" style="block" vertical-align="middle" width="400"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image><wb:inline idref="endo_gonads_digt" purpose="didigetthis" /></body></workbook_page>
