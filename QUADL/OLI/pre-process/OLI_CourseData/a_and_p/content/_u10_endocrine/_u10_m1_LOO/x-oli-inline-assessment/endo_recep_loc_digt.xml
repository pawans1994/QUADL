The receptor is located on the target cell not the hormone producing cell; a receptor is what a hormone binds to.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. By knowing if the receptor is membrane bound or internal certain predictions about the mechanism of its action can be made.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The structure of the receptor will determine what hormone it binds.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.
