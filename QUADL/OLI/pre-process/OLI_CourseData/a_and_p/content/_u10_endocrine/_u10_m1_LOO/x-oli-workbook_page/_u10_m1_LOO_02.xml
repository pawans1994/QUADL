        <p>The <term>lipid-derived hormones</term> include steroid hormones and eicosanoids.
                <term>Steroid</term> hormones, the primary class of lipid hormones in humans, are
            derived from cholesterol and show structural

            testosterone, which are released by reproductive organs, and aldosterone and cortisol,
            which are released by the adrenal glands.</p>

            are released as synthesized<?oxy_comment_end?>. They are insoluble in water, so to
            circulate through the blood they bind to transport proteins in serum. Since they are
            bound to carrier proteins, steroid hormones typically remain in circulation longer than
            other classes of hormones.
