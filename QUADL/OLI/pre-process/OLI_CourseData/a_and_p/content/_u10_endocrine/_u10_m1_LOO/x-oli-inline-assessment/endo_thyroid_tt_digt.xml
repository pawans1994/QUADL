            <body>Before 1924, when Morton Salt began regularly adding iodine to salt in response to
                U.S. health official requests, people living in the upper Midwest and Great Lakes
                Region had a high incidence of goiter. Why?</body>

                <response input="A" match="*" score="10"/>
                <explanation>The soils in that region have some of the lowest iodine levels in the
                    world and they were eating mostly fresh water fish which did not provide iodine
                    in their diet. Coastal regions with access to seafood did not have the same
                    problems. Today with wide distribution of refrigerated fresh and frozen seafood,
                    that is less a concern.</explanation>
