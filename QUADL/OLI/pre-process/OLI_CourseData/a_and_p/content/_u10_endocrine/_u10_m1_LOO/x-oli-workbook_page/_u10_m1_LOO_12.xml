        <p>The <term>anterior pituitary</term> gland, or adenohypophysis, is surrounded by a
            capillary network. This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system
            that carries substances from the hypothalamus directly to the anterior pituitary.
            Remember that substances such as hormones can only leave or enter the circulatory system
            at capillaries, and portal systems (portal systems are also found in the digestive
            system) move material from one capillary bed to another without returning it to the main
            circulation. Anterior pituitary hormones then enter the capillaries and travel to the
            heart and through the systemic system in the same way other hormones do.</p>
        <p> Several anterior pituitary hormones (TSH, ACTH) are tropic hormones, because
            they control the functioning of other endocrine glands. While these hormones are
            produced by the anterior pituitary, their production is controlled by regulatory
            hormones produced by the hypothalamus. Negative feedback mechanisms regulate how much of
            these regulatory hormones is released, and how much anterior pituitary hormone is
            secreted.</p>
