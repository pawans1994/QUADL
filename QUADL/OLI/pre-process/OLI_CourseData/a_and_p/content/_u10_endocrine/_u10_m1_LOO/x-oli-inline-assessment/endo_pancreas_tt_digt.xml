            <body>What would be the stimulus and effect if both alpha and beta cells were secreting
                their hormone?</body>

                <explanation>F or PP cells can stimulate both insulin and glucagon release after a
                    high protein meal or fasting. In the case of protein, glucagon will stimulate
                    the conversion of excess protein into glucose and insulin will lower the
                    resulting increase in blood glucose. In the case of fasting, both are needed to
                    ensure glucose is made available, despite the lack of food intake. Just as with
                    a high protein diet, both hormones contribute to sustaining the cells.
