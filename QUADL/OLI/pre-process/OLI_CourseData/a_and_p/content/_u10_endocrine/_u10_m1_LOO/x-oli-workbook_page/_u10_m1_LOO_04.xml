            Recall<?oxy_delete author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121207T092011-0500" content=","?>
            that peptides are usually
            <?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121207T092125-0500"?>made up of
            <?oxy_insert_end?>fewer than 50 amino acids and proteins
            <?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20121207T092134-0500"?>are
            <?oxy_insert_end?>typically longer than that. Some peptide hormones of longer lengths
            can have <activity_link idref="levels_m1_protein" target="new">secondary

            Protein hormones, being much longer than peptides, can have more extensive
            three-dimensional structures and can even be globular.</p>
        <p>Peptide hormones are a diverse group and include molecules that are only a few amino
            acids, such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin (each with 9 amino acids), produced by
            the pituitary gland. This class also includes proteins, such as growth hormone (191
            amino acids), and glycoproteins, such as follicle-stimulating hormone (92 amino acids
            with glycosylation). Peptide hormones can either be released as produced or stored and
            released in response to stimulus. Most are water soluble and are easily transported in
            blood plasma, but some also bind to transport proteins. Most have a half life of
            minutes.</p>
