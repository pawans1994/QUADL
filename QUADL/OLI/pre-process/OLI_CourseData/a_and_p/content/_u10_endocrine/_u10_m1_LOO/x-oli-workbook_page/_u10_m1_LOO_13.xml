        <p>The <term>posterior pituitary</term> is significantly different in structure and function
            from the anterior pituitary. As its name implies, the posterior pituitary is behind the
            anterior pituitary (toward the back). It contains mostly axons of secretory neurons and
            neuroglial cells; the cell bodies of these neurons are in the hypothalamus. The
            posterior pituitary and the infundibulum together are referred to as the
            neurohypophysis.</p>
        <p>The posterior pituitary does not produce hormones, but stores hormones produced by the
            hypothalamus and releases them into the bloodstream. The hormones antidiuretic hormone
            (ADH) and oxytocin are produced by neurons in the hypothalamus and transported within
            these axons along the infundibulum to the posterior pituitary. They are released into
            the posterior pituitary capillaries in response to neural signaling from the
            hypothalamus. These hormones are considered to be posterior pituitary hormones, even
            though they are produced by the hypothalamus, because that is where they are released
            into the circulatory system.</p>
