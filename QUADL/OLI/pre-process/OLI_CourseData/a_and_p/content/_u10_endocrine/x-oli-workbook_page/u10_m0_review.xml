       <p>
           The major function of the endocrine system is to participate in homeostatic feedback loops by acting as a means of communication
           between integrators and effectors, and sometimes acting as the sensor as well. The endocrine system is also involved with growth,
           development and adaptation. Within all of these changing processes, our bodies tolerate fluctuations within certain limits but still overall homeostasis needs to be maintained.
