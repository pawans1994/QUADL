        <p>Hormones have a wide range of effects and modulate many different body processes. The key
            processes that will be examined in this section are hormonal regulation of the excretory
            system, the reproductive system, metabolism, blood calcium concentrations, growth, and
            the stress response.</p>
        <p>We will see how hormones help the body to maintain homeostasis, by integrating different
            organ systems.</p>
