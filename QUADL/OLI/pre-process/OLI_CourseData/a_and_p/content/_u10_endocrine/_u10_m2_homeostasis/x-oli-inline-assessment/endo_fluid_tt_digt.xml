Many even know of the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, most people don’t know much about this very different disease called diabetes insipidus. The term “diabetes” is derived from Greek meaning “through a siphon”. How would you explain to them why they are both called diabetes?</body><short_answer id="A" /><part id="be9ecd5239b743acac4feda481cb54e4"><skillref idref="endo_fluid_balance_SKILL" /><response input="A" match="*" score="10" /><explanation>Both diseases involve excess urine production (polyuria) and excess thirst (polydipsia). In diabetes insipidus, the lack of the hormone that normally controls water reabsorption by osmosis is missing, so this is a direct link to increased urine production. In diabetes mellitus, the hormone involved is insulin that normally controls movement of glucose from the blood into cells for metabolism. The resulting increased blood glucose results in more glucose being filtered than can be reabsorbed. This extra solute draws more water into the tubules by osmosis, increasing urine volume. As the condition becomes chronic, destruction of the kidney itself increases this effect by presence of protein in the filtrate and urine as well.</explanation></part></question></page></assessment>
