This is not true of neurotransmitters, although some chemicals can be released by both neurons and endocrine gland cells, such as epinephrine from the nervous system and adrenal gland. The mechanism of transport is different, but the effect at the cell receptor is the same.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Hormones are transported in the blood but only affect those cells with a specific receptor for that hormone.</feedback></response></part></question><question id="q3"><body>Quick initiation and conclusion of regulatory effect in the body</body><multiple_choice select="single" shuffle="false"><choice value="A">nervous system</choice><choice value="B">endocrine system</choice></multiple_choice><part id="ab22b059561d4ef89ac71342a52b8f3b"><skillref idref="endo_functions_LO_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Neuron stimulation occurs within milliseconds, and is quickly degraded unless more neurotransmitter is released through continued stimulation.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Once released,hormones must travel to the receptors, and they often circulate in the blood for days with some concentration level.</feedback></response></part></question><question id="q4"><body>Slow initiation, but long-term regulatory effect in the body</body><multiple_choice select="single" shuffle="false"><choice value="A">nervous system</choice><choice value="B">endocrine system</choice></multiple_choice><part id="i05f6e9eece13455fb4bf6037e67664ed"><skillref idref="endo_functions_LO_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Each action potential is quick, and release of neurotransmitters is only continued with continued stimulation of the neuron.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct.
