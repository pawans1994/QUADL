This is indeed a function of the endocrine system; those chemicals are called hormones.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is indeed a function of the endocrine system; there are different mechanisms to affect target cell metabolism.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. This is a function of the nervous system, not the endocrine system, which uses hormones for a slower but longer duration effect on sometimes distant body tissues and cells.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is indeed a function of the endocrine system, although the nervous system also functions in this way.</feedback></response><hint>The endocrine system will share some characteristics with the other major coordinating system, the nervous system, but it will have some major differences from both the nervous system and local cell- or tissue-level communication.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
