Communication between neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body, is done through either the nervous system or the endocrine system. The nervous system utilizes electrochemical impulses to regulate muscles and glands. These signals, carried by neurons, elicit responses in target cells within milliseconds. However, the duration of those responses is very brief unless neuronal signalling continues. The <term>endocrine system</term> regulates biological processes through the release of chemicals called <term>hormones</term>. Hormones are released into body fluidsâ€”usually blood, which carries these chemicals to their target cells, where they elicit a response. The responses elicited by hormones usually take several seconds to several days to occur, and the duration of the response can last just as long without further signalling. Unlike nearly instantaneous nerve impulses, hormones of the endocrine system can regulate functions of the body on longer time scales to maintain homeostasis.</p></body></section></body></workbook_page>
