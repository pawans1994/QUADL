Helping the agonist work more efficiently is one of the functions of synergist.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. A synergist will prevent the movement of a joint that is the origin of the agonist and will stabilize this joint.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. A synergist will prevent the movement of a joint that is the origin of the agonist and will stabilize this joint.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="10"><feedback>Correct.
