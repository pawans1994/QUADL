		<p>Skeletal muscles are arranged in pairs for balance and to work efficiently. </p>

		<p>Some muscles function as agonists, or prime movers. An antagonist is a muscle that
			opposes the action of the agonist. When an agonist contracts to produce a movement, the
			corresponding antagonist will be stretched and contract with sufficient tension to
			control the movement. For instance, when your biceps muscle acts to flex your forearm,
			the triceps muscle contracts slightly to prevent you from flexing your forearm too
			quickly or too strongly.</p>
		<p>Agonist and antagonist muscles work against one another to control and balance movements.
			Other muscles, called synergists (from synergy, to work together), improve the
			efficiency of an agonist muscle. Synergists may provide additional pull or
			stabilization, and their assistance to a particular movement may change throughout the
			progression of the movement. </p>
		<!--<p>The other type of

			called a
			synergist<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20120103T204347-0500"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
			can function in several ways. When a synergist muscle contracts, it helps a larger
			agonist work efficiently. Synergists may provide additional pull near the insertion or
			they may stabilize the point of origin. Their importance in assisting a particular
			movement may change as the movement progresses. Many synergists are most useful at the
			start, when an agonist is stretched, though they may also assist an agonist by
			preventing movement at another joint, thereby stabilizing the origin of the agonist.
			Synergists that act this way are called fixators.</p>-->

			<title>Gross Anatomy of Muscles</title>
			<body>
				<p>Nomenclature for skeletal muscles is based on numerous criteria including: the
					location of the muscle, the shape, the orientation, the number of the muscle in
					a group, the action it generates and the location of its origin(s) and
					insertion(s). The origin is the unmoving, stable connection of the muscle to a
					structure, usually a bone. The insertion is the moveable end of the muscle, and
					it inserts onto various structures in the body.</p>
				<p><em style="bold">Location:</em> Some muscle names indicate the bones or body
					region with which the muscle is associated. For example, the frontalis muscle is
					located on top of the frontal bone of the skull. The rectus femoris (femur) and
					brachioradialis (arm and radius) are also good examples.</p>
				<p><em style="bold">Shapes:</em> Muscles with distinctive shapes are often named for the shape. The
					trapezius in the neck and back is similar to a trapezoid. You have already
					learned about muscles that have “orbicularis” in the name. The size of the
					muscle is the source of the names of the muscles of the buttocks: gluteus
					maximus (largest), gluteus medius (medium) and gluteus minimus (smallest). There
					are also muscles with names that contain brevis (short), longus (long),
					lateralis (lateral side or away from midline) and medialis (toward the midline).
					Some practice with the names of common muscles will help you with the
					descriptions that indicate muscle size or location.</p>
				<p><em style="bold">Orientation:</em> The direction of the muscle fibers and fascicles relative to the
					midline are also used to describe muscles, such as the rectus (straight)
					abdominis or the internal and external oblique (at an angle) muscles of the
					abdomen. </p>
				<p><em style="bold">Numbers in a group:</em> Some muscles are named according to the number of muscles in
					a “group.” One example of this is the quadriceps, a group of four muscles
					located on the anterior (front) of the thigh. Other muscle names can give you a
					clue as to how many origins a particular muscle has, such as the biceps brachii
					or triceps brachii. Bi- indicates that the muscle has two origins and tri-
					indicates three.</p>
				<p><em style="bold">Action:</em> When muscles are named for the movement they produce, you will find
					action words in their name. Some examples are flexor (decreases the angle at the
					joint), extensor (increases the angle at the joint), abductor (moves the bone
					away from the midline) or adductor (moves the bone toward the midline).</p>
				<p><em style="bold">Attachments:</em> The location of a muscle’s orientation and insertion can
					also be used in its name. For this classification, the origin is always named first. For
					instance, the sternocleidomastoid muscle of the neck has a dual origin on the
					sternum (<em style="italic">sterno</em>) and clavicle (<em style="italic">cleido</em>) and it inserts on the mastoid process of
					the temporal bone.</p>
				<p>The following table lists important muscle terminology.</p>

			<title>Explicit Muscle Anatomy: Axial Muscles of the Face, Neck, and Head</title>
			<p>There are more than 600 individually identified skeletal muscles in the human body. An entire
				course could be spent just learning the names, origins, insertions and actions of
				skeletal muscles and muscle groups of the body. This course presents an example of
				integrated muscle units, so that you can appreciate the complex integration of
				muscle anatomy and physiology.</p>
			<p>Muscles can be classified either as axial or appendicular muscles, depending on
				whether they act on bones of the axial or appendicular skeleton, respectively. If we
				just look at the axial muscles, we can further divide them into groups on the basis
				of location, function, or both. Some of the axial muscles may seem to blur the
				boundaries due to the fact that they cross over to the appendicular skeleton. The
				muscles of the head and neck would be considered a subgroup of the axial muscles
				based on location.</p>
			<p>This group can also be divided into those that insert into skin or those that insert
				on bones. The muscles in the face create facial
				expression<?oxy_insert_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20120103T211819-0500"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>
				by inserting into the skin rather than onto bone. These muscles include the
				occipitofrontalis, orbicularis oris, buccinators, orbicularis oculi, and corrugator
				supercilii among others.</p>
			<!--<p>Seems to just dead end…would like to see description or at least a table with these muscles, their origin/insertion, and action – relate to different facial expressions; would be great if you could include videos of each facial expression and illustrate superficial location of muscle(s) involved.</p>-->
