The bicep will shorten as the glass is lifted. Cross-bridges are formed and will be released as you set the glass back down. In order to hold a glass of water at arm’s length for one minute you are using an isometric contraction. You are attempting to maintain stability at your shoulder and elbow joints in a position that is not “resting” for an extended time. </explanation></part></question></page></assessment>
