As a result the opening between the stomach and the small intestine is narrowed and food cannot pass into the small intestine. How should the muscles of the pyloric valve contribute to proper digestive system?</body><multiple_choice select="single" shuffle="true"><choice value="A">Control the release of digestive enzymes from the small intestine</choice><choice value="B">Churning the food and digestive juices in the stomach</choice><choice value="C">Preventing food from ever exiting the stomach.</choice><choice value="D">Compartmentalizing the digestive processes</choice></multiple_choice><part id="c45c20e019484eafa6ccf52d1da3d5e2"><skillref idref="_u5_digestive_sys_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The sphincters control the release of food from the stomach.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The smooth muscles of the stomach churn the food. The sphincters are more like “gates”.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Food must exit the stomach to be absorbed for nutrients.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The sphincters provide “gates” that compartmentalize the digestive organs and processes.</feedback></response><hint>When it is narrowed food cannot pass and the child will vomit up food and fail to gain weight.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
