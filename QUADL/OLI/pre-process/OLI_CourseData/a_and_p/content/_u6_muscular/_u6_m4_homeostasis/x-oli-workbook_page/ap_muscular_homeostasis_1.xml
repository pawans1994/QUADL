Muscle contraction requires energy and produces heat as a byproduct of metabolism. All types of muscle produce heat, but because of the large amount of skeletal muscle present in the body, skeletal muscle contributes most greatly to heat production. This is very noticeable during exercise, when sustained muscle movement causes body temperature to rise. In cases of extreme cold, shivering produces random skeletal muscle contractions to generate heat as part of the negative feedback mechanism of maintaining body temperature.</p><example id="c3edece9146d4228bb862a7fe9502be2"><title>Malignant Hyperthermia</title><p id="ae38ee5ca1f74f00b7be3b680bbcad9a">Our body can use skeletal muscle contractions to maintain body temperature when we are cold, but excessive contractions can lead to the body overheating to the point that the bodyâ€™s metabolic reactions are interrupted. This can occur in a condition called malignant hyperthermia, which develops in genetically susceptible individuals who are administered a specific combination of anesthetic agents during surgery. In these individuals, a drastic increase in skeletal muscle calcium leads to sustained contractions and heat generation. Because the individuals are anesthetized, they have little ability to cool themselves. If proper interventions are not administered, they will die due to a greatly increased body temperature. Because this condition is genetic, patients are asked prior to surgery if there is a family history of such problems occurring.</p></example><wb:inline idref="_u5_homeostasis_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing" /><wb:inline idref="_u5_homeostasis_digt" purpose="didigetthis" /></body></workbook_page>
