The muscles of our mouth, tongue and jaw are responsible for biting and chewing our food. Within our digestive tract, sphincters located throughout the digestive system are responsible for compartmentalizing the digestive processes within discrete organs. We are most familiar with the anal sphincter that we are able to control to excrete waste from the digestive system. Also, throughout the digestive system, smooth muscle helps generate small forces to mix food in the stomach and help maintain movements throughout the digestive process.</p><wb:inline idref="_u5_digestive_sys_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing" /><wb:inline idref="_u5_digestive_sys_digt" purpose="didigetthis" /></body></workbook_page>
