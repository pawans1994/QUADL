			forget about cardiac and smooth muscle, both of which play vital roles in the
			cardiovascular system (and smooth muscle in other systems as well). Your heart needs to
			continuously contract in order to keep blood flowing to your organs, and in turn, supply
			them with needed oxygen and nutrients. But smooth muscle also plays a vital role. It is
			found in the walls of all blood vessels except for capillaries, and its function is to
			dilate or constrict, depending on the needs of the body and the downstream tissues. For
			example, if the skeletal muscles in your legs increase their metabolic rate because you
			start running, smooth muscle cells in the arteries feeding these muscles will relax.
			This dilates these arteries, allowing for a greater blood flow to the muscles of the
			legs. In fact, arteries to other regions (such as the

			tract) may partially constrict in an effort to shunt more blood toward the legs. It is
			these smooth muscles that play a vital role in sending higher amounts of blood to where
			it is needed most. Skeletal muscles also play a role within the cardiovascular system.
			The heart acts as the pump to move blood out to the body cells, but the skeletal muscles
			assist with the movement of blood back to the heart. Because of valves in the veins that
