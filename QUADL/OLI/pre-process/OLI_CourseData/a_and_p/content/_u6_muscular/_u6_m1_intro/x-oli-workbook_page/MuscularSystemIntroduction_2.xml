		<p>When discussing the skeletal muscular system, it is important to review some terminology
			to avoid confusion. Remember that a system is typically defined as a group of organs
			that contribute to a particular function (or functions). The skeletal muscular system
			doesn’t cleanly fit this definition since it contributes to many of the body’s functions
			(such as chewing for digestion, diaphragm for breathing, etc.). Thus the skeletal muscle
			system is a unique system, responsible for movements in the body. In this unit, we will
			also consider all of the body’s muscle tissues: skeletal, cardiac and smooth.
			Technically, the organ made of cardiac muscle (the heart) is part of the cardiovascular
			system. However, many of the molecular, cellular and tissue level features are similar
			to skeletal muscle, so we will present all types of muscles here. We will start by
			reviewing the different levels of the muscular system.</p>
		<p>When most people think of muscles, they think of skeletal muscles that are visible just
			under the skin. In athletes, skeletal muscles are especially toned to supply strong and
			precise forces for movement. The adaptability of skeletal muscles allows changes in mass
			as a result of how
			much<?oxy_delete author="michellemyers" timestamp="20120103T193542-0500" content=","?>
			or how little use they get. When a skeletal muscle increases in size, it does so by
			adding structural proteins to individual cells, but it does not increase the number of
			muscle cells present. In addition to generating motion, muscles also restrain motion.
			Restraining motion is just as important as generating it: muscles hold the bones in
			position to keep the skeleton upright. </p>
		<p>Other types of muscles are less visible than skeletal muscles but are just as important.
			As already noted, smooth muscles aid in the control of airflow in the respiratory tract,
			blood flow in blood vessels, and movement of food in the gastrointestinal tract, among
			many other functions. Cardiac muscle maintains blood flow through the heart and
			generates the pressure to move blood throughout the rest of the body. </p>
		<p>Skeletal muscles produce locomotion (movement to get around) and
			any movement that can be consciously controlled. Whereas most skeletal muscles are
			attached to bone, some skeletal muscles are attached to other muscles and skin. Because
			force generation typically requires conscious control from the nervous system, skeletal
			muscle is called voluntary muscle. This voluntary control is achieved through neural
			control, which transmits information from the brain and spinal cord to the muscle.
			Skeletal muscle can exert a wide range of force depending on the task. Muscles in the
			arm can lift a very light pen, a very heavy dumbbell, and everything in between.</p>
		<p><term>Cardiac muscle</term> tissue is only found in the heart. Contractions of
			cardiac muscle pump blood throughout the body and maintain blood pressure. Similar to
			skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated, but unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle
			cannot be consciously controlled and is thus called involuntary muscle. Cardiac
			contractions are controlled by the <extra>
				<anchor><term>pacemaker cells</term></anchor>
				<meaning>
					<material>
						<p>a group of cells in the heart that directly initiate heart muscle
							contraction by firing spontaneous action potentials</p>
					</material>
				</meaning>
			</extra>, leading to a fairly steady and consistent heartbeat. To change the rate of
			contractions, the pacemaker cells can react to stimuli, such as circulating hormones or
			the autonomic nervous system (nervous functions outside of conscious control).
			Neurotransmitters and hormones such as those produced in response to fear can modulate
			the rate at which contractions occur by influencing the pacemaker cells.</p>
		<p><term>Smooth muscle</term> tissue is present in the walls of hollow organs and
			structures that transport and hold material including digestive organs (stomach) and
			urinary organs (bladder), as well as respiratory tracts (trachea) and circulatory tracts
			(arteries). Smooth muscle also plays specialized roles in the body. For example, it is
			present in the eyes, where it functions to change the size of the iris and alter the
			shape of the lens. Smooth muscle also causes hair to stand erect in response to cold
			temperature or fear. Smooth muscle has no striations, as it does not possess the
			microscopic organizing structures found in skeletal and cardiac muscle; it is therefore
			called nonstriated muscle. Smooth muscle is not under voluntary control; thus, it is
			also called involuntary muscle. The triggers for smooth muscle contraction include
			hormones, neural stimulation, and even stretch.</p>
