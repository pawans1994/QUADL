		<p>Throughout this unit we will discuss common skeletal muscular dysfunctions in comparison to
			healthy tissue. In examining dysfunction, we can better understand normal function, in
			addition to understanding the physiological basis of diseases.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Fatigue—people generally understand muscle fatigue as the inability to perform muscular
				activity to the desired level, but this course will present a more technical
				definition later.</li>
					<li>Muscular dystrophies—a group of hereditary (genetic) diseases that cause weakening of the
				body’s muscles.</li>
				
					<li>Muscular atrophies—decreases in muscle mass (loss of protein within muscle cells and/or
				loss of cells within muscle tissue), caused by disease, age or disuse.</li>

					<li>Motor neuron disease—Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also referred to as Lou Gehrig's
				disease, is a disorder which affects the connections of the nerves with the
				voluntary skeletal muscle.</li>

					<li>Botulinum, curare and other toxins—these toxins are naturally occurring proteins or small
				molecules that inhibit muscle function, usually at the synapse between nerves and
				skeletal muscles.</li>
					<li><?oxy_comment_start author="michellemyers" timestamp="20120103T195743-0500" comment="Why doesn&apos;t this simply say &quot;rigor mortis&quot;? (without the additional &quot;rigor&quot;)"?>Rigor
				and rigor mortis<?oxy_comment_end?>—when energy is depleted from skeletal muscles,
				the tissue becomes stiff because of its inability to relax.</li>
