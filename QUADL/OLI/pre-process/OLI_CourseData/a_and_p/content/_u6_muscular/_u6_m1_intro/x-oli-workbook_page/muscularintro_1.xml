		<p>When you think of muscles you probably have a picture in your mind of some muscular
			people who are pleasing to the eye. Did you know that you have over 650 muscles in your
			body? That sounds like a lot but a caterpillar has even more, around 4000 muscles!
			Without muscles we would never be able to move. The main function of the muscular system
			is movement. But did you know that muscle contractions generate 85% of our body heat?
			Muscles also protect our organs. Your abdominal muscles keep your “guts” and internal
			organs in place. Some muscles are circular, such as the one that encircles your mouth
			for kissing or puckering. Other circular muscles form sphincters which control when you
			defecate or urinate. One important muscle, known as your diaphragm, is necessary for
			breathing. If your diaphragm stopped working you
			would die in minutes because you would not breathe.</p>
		<p>Let’s test your knowledge on some common facts and myths of the muscular system.</p>
