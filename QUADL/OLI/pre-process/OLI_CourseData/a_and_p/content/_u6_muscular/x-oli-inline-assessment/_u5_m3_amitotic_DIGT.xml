Cells also require huge amounts of energy to divide; energy can be robbed by division machinery.</p></feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback><p id="abf5fc9f33c9943b4a058a5ed7e6209a0">Incorrect. The age of the cells is not a factor; their differentiation state is a factor.</p></feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback><p id="af8fca842dc054d0bbff47240724d8c48">Incorrect. Nuclei of muscle cells (which contain DNA) are not lost, but they do move to the edges.</p></feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback><p id="ad7c922212b5540039b2102013d29640e">Incorrect.
