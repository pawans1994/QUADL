This prevents signal transmission and, eventually, results indeath of the motor end-plate. How does this work?</body><multiple_choice shuffle="true"><choice value="A">Acetylcholine cannot reach the blocked receptors, and the signal is blocked.</choice><choice value="B">Antibodies rupture the vesicles and prevent acetylcholine release, and the signal is blocked.</choice><choice value="C">Neurons use choline molecules to produce antibodies instead of acetylcholine, so there is no acetylcholine to be transferred.</choice><choice value="D">Calcium ion movement is altered by antibody binding, and the signal is blocked.</choice></multiple_choice><part id="fef18a5923b14ab6b292aa036127f7fa"><skillref idref="_u5_electrical_signal_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="10"><feedback>Correct. When acetylcholine nicotinic receptors are blocked, the acetylcholine cannot reach the receptors, so the signal is inhibited.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Acetylcholine is kept in vesicles, but the vesicles are not ruptured, since they are contained inside neurons.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Antibodies, produced by immune cells, are large proteins.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. It is possible that calcium flux is altered, but the primary mechanism is via the acetylcholine and acetylcholine nicotinic receptors.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
