What disease can this be used to treat? For these choices, &quot;atrophy&quot; means partial or complete wasting away and &quot;-pathy&quot; means damage or disease.</body><multiple_choice shuffle="true"><choice value="A">Muscle spasms</choice><choice value="B">Bacterial infection</choice><choice value="C">Neuropathy</choice><choice value="D">Muscle atrophy</choice></multiple_choice><part id="i6b719a6e22704e4e8ffcf0ac9d813202"><skillref idref="_u5_electrical_signal_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Botox was originally developed to relax muscle spasms. Now itâ€™s often used to relax muscles in order to reduce wrinkles.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The toxin is developed from bacteria, but it would have no effect on a bacteria infection.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Botox affects the neuromuscular junction, but it does not cause or repair damage to the nerve.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Eventually a lack of nervous stimulation would cause atrophy, so Botox would not be used to treat atrophy.</feedback></response><hint>If Botox inhibits the release of neurotransmitters, what would it help?</hint><hint>Poisoning with botulinum toxin causes muscle paralysis.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
