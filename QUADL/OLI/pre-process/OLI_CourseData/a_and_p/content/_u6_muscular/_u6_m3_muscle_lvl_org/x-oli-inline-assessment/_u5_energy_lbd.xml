Bodybuilding requires a lot of energy in a short amount of time. Glucose quickly can be turned into ATP using anaerobic fermentation.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Protein can enter aerobic respiration, which takes longer and requires more oxygen than is available during the short burst of exercise.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Inorganic phosphate by itself does not provide energy for muscle movement.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Fatty acids can enter aerobic respiration, which takes longer and requires more oxygen than is available during the short burst of exercise.</feedback></response><hint>Bodybuilders use a lot of short, fast bursts of energy.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
