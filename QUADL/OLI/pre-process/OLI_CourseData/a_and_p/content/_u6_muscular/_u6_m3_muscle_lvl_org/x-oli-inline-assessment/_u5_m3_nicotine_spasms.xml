This can contribute to muscle spasms. Why?</body><multiple_choice shuffle="true"><choice value="A">Nicotine acts like acetylcholine at the receptor, which can lead to unwanted muscle contraction.</choice><choice value="B">Nicotine is a small molecule and diffuses into the motor end plate easily.</choice><choice value="C">Nicotine overstimulates nerves.</choice><choice value="D">Nicotine alters sodium and potassium levels, affecting muscle electrochemical potential.</choice></multiple_choice><part id="f7f9e3fc361849959694165eb3ad89d2"><skillref idref="_u5_electrical_signal_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Nicotinic receptors are classified as such because nicotine can bind to and activate them.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Nicotine is a small molecule, but so is acetylcholine.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Nicotine does stimulate nerves, but it is the action on the acetylcholine receptors that causes spasms.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Nicotine does alter sodium and potassium channels, but only in the same way as acetylcholine.</feedback></response><hint>Review the processes occurring in the neuromuscular junction.</hint><hint>Review how acetylcholine is produced, how it is processed, how it is introduced, how it signals, and how it is degraded.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
