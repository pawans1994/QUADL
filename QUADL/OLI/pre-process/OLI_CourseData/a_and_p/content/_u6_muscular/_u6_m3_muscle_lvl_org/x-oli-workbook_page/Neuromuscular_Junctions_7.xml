		<p>Muscle contractions are among the largest energy-consuming processes in the body, which
			is not surprising considering the work that muscles constantly do. Skeletal muscles move
			the body in obvious ways such as walking and in less noticeable ways such as

			The structure of muscle cells at the microscopic level allows them to convert the

			and myosin play large roles in producing this movement.</p>

			<title>Skeletal Muscle Fiber Types</title>
			<body>

				<p>There are three main types of skeletal muscle fibers (cells): <term>slow oxidative</term> (SO), which primarily uses aerobic respiration; <term>fast oxidative</term> (FO), which is an intermediate between slow
					oxidative and fast glycolytic fibers; and <term>fast glycolytic</term>
					(FG), which primarily uses anaerobic glycolysis. Fibers are defined as slow or
					fast based on how quickly they contract. The speed of contraction is dependent
					on how quickly the ATPase of myosin can hydrolyse ATP to produce cross-bridge
					action. Fast fibers hydrolyse ATP approximately twice as quickly as slow fibers,
					resulting in quicker cross-bridge cycling. The primary metabolic pathway used
					determines whether a fiber is oxidative or glycolytic. If a fiber primarily
					produces ATP through aerobic pathways, it is oxidative. Glycolytic fibers
					primarily create ATP through anaerobic glycolysis.</p>
				<p>Since SO fibers function for long periods without fatigue, they are used to
					maintain posture, producing isometric contractions useful for stabilizing bones
					and joints, and making small movements that happen often but do not require
					large amounts of energy. They do not produce high tension, so they are not used
					for powerful, fast movements that require high amounts of energy and rapid
					cross-bridge cycling.</p>
				<p>FO fibers are sometimes called intermediate fibers because they possess
					characteristics that are intermediate between fast fibers and slow fibers. They
					produce ATP relatively quickly, more quickly than SO fibers, and thus can
					produce relatively high amounts of tension. They are oxidative because they
					produce ATP aerobically, possess high numbers of mitochondria, and do not
					fatigue quickly. FO fibers do not possess significant myoglobin, giving them a
					lighter color than the red SO fibers. FO fibers are used primarily for
					movements, such as walking, that require more energy than postural control but
					less energy than an explosive movement such as sprinting. FO fibers are useful
					for this type of movement because they produce more tension than SO fibers and
					they are more fatigue-resistant than FG fibers.</p>
				<p>FG fibers primarily use anaerobic glycolysis as their ATP source. They have a
					large diameter and possess high amounts of glycogen, which is used in glycolysis
					to generate ATP quickly; thus, they produce high levels of tension. Because they
					do not primarily use aerobic metabolism, they do not possess substantial numbers
					of mitochondria nor large amounts of myoglobin and therefore have a white color.
					FG fibers are used to produce rapid, forceful contractions to make quick,
					powerful movements. However, these fibers fatigue quickly, permitting them to
					only be used for short periods.</p>

				<p>Most muscles (organs) possess a mixture of each fiber (cell) type. The
					predominant fiber type in a muscle is determined by the primary function of the
					muscle. Large muscles used for powerful movements contain more fast fibers than
					slow fibers. As such, different muscles have different speeds and different
					abilities to maintain contraction over time. The proportion of these different
					kinds of muscle fibers will vary among different people and can change within a
					person with conditioning.</p>
