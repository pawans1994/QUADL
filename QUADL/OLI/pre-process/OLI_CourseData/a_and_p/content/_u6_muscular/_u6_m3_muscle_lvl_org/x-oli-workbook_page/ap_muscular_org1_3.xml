One muscle may contain as many as 100,000 of the repeating sarcomere units. In the sarcomere, the myofilaments (thick filaments and thin filaments) are organized into parallel units. Sarcomeres were first identified by imaging (histology), and the nomenclature described below reflects their microscopic &quot;appearance.&quot; </p><image id="e9670eb0a36b4a11bdbb34ad7b03608f" src="../../webcontent/Muscle_04.jpg" alt="Sarcomere detail" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" width="500"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image><section id="e2997efb20b7440fa6c40c0f33ef68a6"><title>Molecular Organization of Muscle</title><body><materials id="Actin" title="Actin Filaments"><material><image id="fc2726e7872941ddb231dfe6df75b73e" src="../../webcontent/Muscle_5a.jpg" alt="Actin" style="block" vertical-align="middle" height="150" width="200"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image></material><material><image id="a994509609a94e35941696941a6f6f0c" src="../../webcontent/Muscle_5b.jpg" alt="Actin" style="block" vertical-align="middle" height="150" width="200"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image></material></materials><p id="b544b644f79e4915a8a67b2bd0ce5ab4"><term>Myofilaments</term> are organized structures in muscle cells that contain the actin and myosin. The organized globular proteins of actin in muscle cells form a <term>thin filament</term>, and bundles of over 200 myosin proteins form a <term>thick filament</term>. The thick filament myosin heads “walk” along the actin thin filaments. A single thin filament is composed of 300-400 globular actins with 40-60 troponin and tropomyosin molecules. A single thick filament is composed of more than 200 myosin molecules.</p><p id="bb8edbea767a4a7888115a8cd728dde0">Actin filaments are thin, causing the actin &quot;rope&quot; to appear skinny. The myosin filament contains many myosins bundled up with all of the head groups sticking out, so that it looks “fluffy.” That fluffiness makes it look thick. </p><wb:inline idref="_u5_m3_protein_fil_LBD" purpose="learnbydoing" /></body></section><section id="df4344f592e849e5a8acf5013d8ddfab"><title>Sarcomere Anatomy—H Zone, M Line, Z Disc, I Band and A Band</title><body><image id="b585a5b166b646ae9bf347924c6fb301" src="../../webcontent/Muscle_6.jpg" alt="Sarcomere Anatomy" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" width="650"><caption /><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="c555d7773cab45c39ac4df19170bfe9c">Histological sections of muscle show the anatomical features of the sarcomeres. Thick filaments, composed of myosin, are visible as the <term>A band</term> of a sarcomere. Thin filaments, composed of actin, attach to a protein in the <term>Z disc</term> (or <term>Z line</term>) called alpha-actinin, and they are present across the entire length of the <term>I band</term> and a portion of the A band. The region where thick and thin filaments overlap has a dense appearance, as there is little space between the filaments. This zone where thin and thick filaments overlap is very important to muscle contraction, as it is the site where filament movement starts. Thin filaments do not extend completely into the A bands, leaving a central region of the A band that only contains thick filaments. This central region of the A band looks slightly lighter than the rest of the A band, and is called the H zone. The middle of the H zone has a vertical line called the <term>M line</term>, where accessory proteins hold together thick filaments.</p><table id="e79df8d26d0440c4a14e4fdd1eb2ac4b" summary="" rowstyle="alternating"><cite id="if2733855040c46a3a16ab80f91a10b06" /><caption /><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="aca1f25565ab74efda9fcbabd24b33008">Microscopically Visible Feature</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="aa62fb09621e84a03ba43e0f916b2cc4c">Composition</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="acd4bc7a14bb04597935788f3814acc61">A band</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="aadc7cbf374f443f4a69b3c7060c8e147">Region of thick-filament myosin proteins</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="ac32161403dab47c59e8b53853d070dfb">H zone</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="ad1afe3d14bf048aa821b29a6d32b4751">Central region of the A band with no overlapping actin proteins when muscle is relaxed</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="af46faa5c3a30415d816409685574f280">I band</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="af44d5451d41746cf8634218e7a387c14">Region of thin-filament actin proteins, with no myosin</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="aab9f29d00e6742dc8086e8a4dcd51e69">M line</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="ac9db085218a14cb1a6dd25771fddd666">M line accessory proteins in center of myosin thick filament perpendicular to the sarcomere</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="aba639cc7d63949acabc6efffdecb6731">Z disc</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="acb1c554fce6446a7945a4c0db6437cfc">Zig-zag line of Z line proteins and actin binding proteins perpendicular to the sarcomere</p></td></tr></table><wb:inline idref="_u5_m3_filament-orient_LBD" purpose="learnbydoing" /></body></section></body></workbook_page>
