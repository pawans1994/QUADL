        <p>The main function of the muscular system is movement, although muscle contractions also generate 85% of our body heat and 
        protect our organs. The muscular system is composed mainly of skeletal muscle, but there are two other types of muscle that are critical
        for life: cardiac muscle, which is found in your heart, and smooth muscle, which is found in many organs and blood vessels. </p>

        <p>The muscular system consists of skeletal muscle connected to bones via tendons. Tendons are a type of dense regular connective tissue 
            that joins muscles to bone. Skeletal muscle attaches to bones, is voluntary, and has a striped (striated) appearance. Cardiac muscle
            is found in the heart, is involuntary and is striated. Smooth, sometimes known as visceral muscle, is found in many organs and blood 
            vessels, is not striated but is involuntary. Muscle fibers are found in all muscle tissue. The fibers are bundled and held together
            with connective tissue.Sarcomeres are the basic unit of muscle cells, and their shortening is responsible for muscle contraction.
