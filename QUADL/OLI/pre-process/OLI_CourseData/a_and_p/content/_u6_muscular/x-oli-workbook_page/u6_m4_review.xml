Consider the body’s tendency to shiver when it’s cold, producing random skeletal muscle contraction to generate heat as part of the negative feedback mechanism. </p><p id="b0788facbc8547a2a735c11fa5df3b48">Endurance training can modify slow fibers (predominantly used in endurance exercises) to make them even more efficient by producing more mitochondria to enable more aerobic metabolism and more ATP production. Endurance exercise can also increase the amount of myoglobin in a cell, as increased aerobic respiration increases the need for oxygen. Myoglobin is found in the sarcoplasm and stores oxygen. Endurance training can also trigger the formation of more extensive capillary networks around the fiber, a process called angiogenesis, to supply oxygen and remove metabolic waste.</p></body></workbook_page>
