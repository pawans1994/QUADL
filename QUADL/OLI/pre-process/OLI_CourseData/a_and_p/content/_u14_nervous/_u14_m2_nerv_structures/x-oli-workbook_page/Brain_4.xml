		<p>The <term>forebrain</term> is the large overarching region of the brain. In the center,
			above the midbrain are the <term>thalamus</term> and <term>hypothalamus</term>.</p>

		<p>The thalamus is a set of nuclei mainly involved in the relay of sensory signals. Those
			will be covered in more depth in sensory units. Other thalamic nuclei are involved in
			memory and emotions.</p>
		<p>The hypothalamus is a set of nuclei situated underneath the thalamus. The main function
			of the hypothalamus is control of the endocrine system and as such will be covered in
			more detail there. Other nuclei of the hypothalamus are involved in many autonomic
			functions such as thermoregulation, food and water intake, biological cycles, and
			emotions.</p>

		<p>The <term>cerebrum</term> is the major anatomic feature of the human brain. The cerebrum
			is made of lobes. The <term>frontal lobe</term> is from the frontal bone to central
			sulcus and is involved in voluntary motor functions, planning and foresight, memory,
			mood, emotion, social judgment, and aggression.</p>

		<p>The <term>parietal lobe</term> is the upper part of brain in each hemisphere from the
			central sulcus to parietal-occipital sulcus; this lobe is primarily involved in sensory
			reception and integration.</p>
		<p>The <term>temporal lobe</term> of each hemisphere sits under the parietal lobe and the
			lateral sulcus; this lobe has roles in hearing, smell, learning, memory, visual
			recognition and emotional behavior.</p>
		<p>The lobe furthest to the rear of the head is the <term>occipital lobe</term>, and it
			contains the visual center.</p>
		<p>The <term>insula</term> is a mass of cortex underneath the outer lobes, found beneath the
			frontal and temporal lobes.</p>

		<p>The basal nuclei are clusters of cell bodies found at the bottom (base) of the cerebrum, surrounding the thalamus. 
			They include the caudate nucleus, and the putamen, and globus pallidus, (last two collectively known as the <term>lentiform nucleus</term> 
			and all 3 are sometimes referred to as the <term>corpus striatum</term>) and are involved in motor control.</p>

		<p>The limbic system is a loop of cortical structures in temporal lobe surrounding corpus
			callosum and thalamus. These structures include the hippocampus, amygdala, fornix, and
			cingulate gyrus. More on the hippocampus and amygdala later in the presentation of
			higher level functions.</p>
