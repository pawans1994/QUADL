			<p>The white matter of the spinal cord is divided into the paired
			posterior (dorsal), lateral, and anterior (ventral) columns. These columns are sometimes
			called <term>funiculi</term> (or <term>funiculus</term> when singular) and are made up of axons that are traveling
			up (ascending) or down (descending) the spinal cord. The ascending tracts generally
			carry sensory information from the periphery to the brain, while the descending tracts
			carry motor signals to muscles and glands.</p>
		<p>The columns can be further divided into tracts (sometimes called <term>fasciculi</term>), which is a
			way of functionally grouping the neurons based on similar origin, destination and
			function. These tracts are often named for the structures that they connect. For
			example, the <term>spinothalamic tract</term> indicates that the fibers are carrying information from
			the spinal cord to the thalamus of the brainstem. You may note from its name that it is
			an ascending tract, so the information that it carries is sensory.</p>
		<p>Some of the tracts cross over (<term>decussate</term>) either in the spinal cord or brainstem, and
			when this occurs, the relationship between the origin and destination is termed
			<term>contralateral</term>. Much of our motor control is contralateral. For example, your right arm
			is mainly controlled by the motor area in your left brain. When the origin and
			destination of a tract are on the same side of the body, it is referred to as an
			<term>ispsilateral</term> relationship.</p>
