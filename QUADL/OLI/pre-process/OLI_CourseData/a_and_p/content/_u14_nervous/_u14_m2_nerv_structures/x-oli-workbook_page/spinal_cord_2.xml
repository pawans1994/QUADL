		<p>Recall that the central nervous system tissues can generally be divided into white matter
			and gray matter. White matter is the myelin-containing region composed of axons, which
			make up the tracts of the CNS. These carry information between different regions and
			structures in the CNS. Gray matter contains the cell bodies and dendrites and therefore
			is the site of synaptic transmission.</p>
		<p>In the cortex of the brain, gray matter makes up the cortical (outer) regions, while
			the white matter tracts tend to make up the majority of the deep tissues of the brain,
			although there are exceptions to the latter, such as the deep basal and thalamic nuclei that are composed of gray matter. In contrast to this general arrangement of the brain, the spinal
			cord is arranged with the white matter surrounding the central gray
			matter, indicating that the spinal tracts carry information up and down the cord along
			the outer aspects, while synaptic transmission tends to occur more centrally.</p>

		<p>In the image above, you can see how the
			central gray matter is somewhat butterfly shaped, with each side of the “butterfly”
			containing a <term>posterior (dorsal) horn</term> and an <term>anterior (ventral) horn</term>. Each of the horns
			is contiguous with the <term>posterior</term> and <term>anterior spinal nerve roots</term>, respectively. The
			posterior root of the nerve carries sensory information into the posterior horn, often
			synapsing there. The anterior horn contains the cell bodies of <term>somatic motor neurons</term>,
			and it sends its <term>axons</term> out the anterior root of the spinal nerve to the muscle cells it
			innervates. The lateral horn is not found at all levels of the spinal cord, but is
			limited to thoracic and lumber segments of the cord. This is because the lateral horns
			contain the neurons of the <term>sympathetic nervous system</term>, which leave the cord only in
			these segments. Even though the cell bodies are found in the lateral horns, their axons
			leave via the anterior nerve roots, just like those that control skeletal muscle. The
			matched horns on each side of the “butterfly” are connected via the <term>gray commissure</term>, which also surrounds the cerebrospinal fluid filled central canal.</p>
		
		
		<p>The white matter of the spinal cord is divided into columns. Each
			segment of the cord contains matched <term>posterior</term>, <term>lateral</term> and <term>anterior columns</term>. The
			anterior columns and posterior columns are partially separated by the <term>anterior median
			fissure</term> and <term>posterior median sulcus</term>, respectively. Each pair is also connected by a
			commissure of white matter that runs adjacent to the gray commissure, termed the
			<term>anterior</term> and <term>posterior commissures</term>. The columns are further divided into tracts that
			carry sensory information up the spinal cord (<term>ascending tracts</term>) and motor information
			down the spinal cord (<term>descending tracts</term>).</p>

		<p>Although each segment of the spinal cord has similar features, there are some
			differences along its length, as you may be able to determine from the image above. The main difference is that
			the ratio of gray matter to white matter varies among segments of the spinal cord. At
			the lower levels of the spinal cord there is a greater ratio of grey matter to white
			matter. This should make sense, as there are less ascending and descending tracts of
			whiter matter as you move lower. As previously mentioned, the lateral horns are only
			found in the thoracic and lumber regions of the spinal cord, where they contain the motor
			nuclei of the sympathetic nervous system. Finally, the size of the anterior and
			posterior horns varies, depending on the amount of tissue they are innervating. For example, the thoracic segments have relatively
			small anterior horns, as there is little skeletal muscle to innervate in the thorax and
			abdomen, while the cervical and thoracolumbar regions have large anterior horns, used to
			innervate the skeletal muscles of the arms and legs, respectively.</p>
