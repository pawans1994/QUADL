The classification of receptors into types can be based on three different criteria: structure of the receptors, location of the receptors relative to the stimuli they sense, and by the types of stimuli to which they respond. Regardless of type, the function of these receptors is to transduce a stimulus from one form of energy (chemical, physical, etc.) into a change in the cell membrane potential that may or may not create an action potential. Collectively, the receptors and associated neurons that sense and process information related to our somesthetic senses are called the somatosensory system. Make sure you understand the different categories of receptors within this system.</p><p id="f83c21bfb2074dd3b2b0fa4409e4f5b1">Before taking the quiz below, consider again the learning objectives for this module.
