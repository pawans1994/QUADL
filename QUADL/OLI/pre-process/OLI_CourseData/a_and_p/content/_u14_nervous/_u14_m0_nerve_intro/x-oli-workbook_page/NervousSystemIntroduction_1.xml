The nervous system is often referred to as the master controller of the human body. Like the endocrine system, the other internal control system of the human body, the nervous system is specialized for communication of information from one part of the body to another. The nervous system communicates quickly using neurons, the specialized cells of the nervous system. <term>Neurons</term> can convey and process information using electrical and chemical signals. Ultimately, neural communication helps coordinate body activities and ensures we maintain homeostasis.</p></body></workbook_page>
