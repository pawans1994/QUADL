		<p>Along with hearing, the inner ear is responsible for encoding information about
			equilibrium (the sense of balance), which it does in the vestibular apparatus (Figure
			5). Similar to the cochlea, the vestibular structures use hair cells with stereocilia to
			detect movement of fluid, in this case, in response to changes in head position or
			acceleration. Detection of head position when the body is stationary is termed <em
				style="bold">static equilibrium. </em>The information for static equilibrium comes
			from the <em style="bold">utricle </em>and <em style="bold">saccule</em>. <em
				style="bold">Dynamic equilibrium </em>is the perception of acceleration. Information
			for dynamic equilibrium can come from the utricle and saccule, which detect linear
			acceleration, and/or the semicircular canals, which detect angular acceleration. The
			neural signals generated from the vestibule are transmitted to the brainstem and
			cerebellum from sensory neurons in the vestibular ganglion.</p>
