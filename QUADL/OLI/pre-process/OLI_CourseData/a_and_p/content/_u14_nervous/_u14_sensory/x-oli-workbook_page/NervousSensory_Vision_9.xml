		<p>Because rhodopsin found in the rod cells is most sensitive to white light while the cone
			cells are color specific, rods are suited for vision in low-light conditions and cones
			are suited for brighter conditions. In normal sunlight, rhodopsin will be constantly
			bleached and the cones are active. In a darkened room, there is not enough light to
			activate cone opsins, and vision is entirely dependent on rods. Rods are so sensitive to
			light that a single photon can result in an action potential from the corresponding RGC.
			The three cone photopsins, being sensitive to different wavelengths of light, can aid in
			color vision. By comparing the activity of the three different cones, the brain can
			extract color information from visual stimuli. Since rods are bleached when cones are
			active and cones cannot react to low-intensity light, rods result in monochromatic
			vision. In a dark room, everything appears as a shade of gray shadow. If you think that
			you can see colors in the dark, it is most likely because your brain knows what color
			something is and relies on that memory. If you are walking through your dark living room
			and you are certain that the couch appears green, this is because you already know what
			color it is, not because you perceive it with rod photoreceptors.</p>
