		<p>Because there are multiple types of nociceptors (Table C) that can transmit information
			at different rates (Table D), our pain sensation is not always the same. Scientists
			generally recognize three different pain categories (sensations or stimulus modalities),
			as described in Table E.</p>

				<td align="center">Burning pain/ soreness pain</td>
				<td>Elicited by inflammation secondary to damaged tissue (hit thumb with hammer,
					etc.). Arises mainly from skin, but also from tissues such as muscle. It is more
					diffuse and longer in duration than fast pain.</td>
