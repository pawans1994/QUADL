				<title>Why I Do Science: Danielle Reed - QUEST Philadelphia </title>
				<caption>Dr. Danielle Reed of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in
					Philadelphia, PA, became interested in science at an early age, based on her experiences
					with sensory experiences. She recognized that she had a different ability to taste
					bitterness compared to other people she knew. Now, she studies the genetic differences
					between people in their sensitivities to taste stimuli. In the video, there is a brief
					image of a person sticking out their tongue covered with a colored dye. This is how Dr.
					Reed is able to visualize papillae on the surface of the tongue and count how many there
					are for a research subject. People fall into two large groups, known as “tasters” and
					“non-tasters” based on the density of papillae on their tongue, which is also a sign of
					the number of taste buds. Non-tasters can taste food, but they are not as sensitive to
					some stimuli, like Dr. Reed is to bitterness.</caption>
