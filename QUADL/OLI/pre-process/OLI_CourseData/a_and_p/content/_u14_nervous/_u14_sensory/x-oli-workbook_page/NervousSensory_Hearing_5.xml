		<p>Along with hearing, the inner ear is responsible for encoding information about
			equilibrium (the sense of balance), which it does in the vestibular apparatus.</p>

			<p>Similar to the cochlea, the vestibular structures use hair cells with stereocilia to
			detect movement of fluid, in this case, in response to changes in head position or
			acceleration. Detection of head position when the body is stationary is termed <term>static equilibrium</term>. The information for static equilibrium comes
			from the <term>utricle</term> and <term>saccule</term>. <term>Dynamic equilibrium</term> is the perception of acceleration. Information
			for dynamic equilibrium can come from the utricle and saccule, which detect linear
			acceleration, and/or the semicircular canals, which detect angular acceleration. The
			neural signals generated from the vestibule are transmitted to the brainstem and
			cerebellum from sensory neurons in the vestibular ganglion.</p>

		<p>The saccule and utricle each contain a sense organ, called the <term>macula</term>, where stereocilia and their supporting cells are found. These maculae
			(plural) are oriented 90 degrees to one another so that they respond to positions in
			different planes. 
			
			<image src="../../webcontent/Nerv_33.jpg" alt="Structure of the Maculae. The macula utriculi (macula of
				the utricle) lies horizontally while the macula sacculi lies vertically (a). If the head
				is tilted, the dense otolithic membrane will cause the stereocilia of the hair cells to
				move from the straight position (b) to the bent position (c), sending signals to the
				central nervous system that the head has been tilted forward." width="600">

			The organs can respond to changes in position and
			acceleration because the tips of their stereocilia project into a dense <term>otolithic membrane</term> made up of a mixture containing granules of calcium and
			protein, called <term>otoliths</term>, which gives rise to their common name,
			the <term>otolithic organs</term>. When the maculae (otolithic organs) move,
			gravity causes the dense otolithic membrane to move relative to the less dense cell
			layer beneath the stereocilia. This causes the stereocilia to bend, initiating action
			potentials in the vestibular nerve fibers that innervate them.</p>
		<p>Bundles of stereocilia are arranged in various directions, so that any direction of
			inclination will depolarize a subset of the hair cells and hyperpolarize a corresponding
			subset of sensory neurons. How the body senses head position and the linear (horizontal or vertical)
			direction of acceleration is determined by the specific pattern of hair-cell activity
			across the maculae.</p>
