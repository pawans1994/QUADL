		<p>Sometimes the structures of the eye do not refract light appropriately, such that it
			focuses either in front of (myopia) or behind (hyperopia) the retina. This can happen,
			for instance, when the eye is not perfectly round. In order to correct for abnormalities
			in light refraction, glasses or contact lenses can be added to the system to better
			focus light on the retina and improve vision.</p>

		<p>	Normal light refraction leads to the light rays converging on the retina (a). In the
			case of hyperopia, the light rays focus behind the retina. This is corrected using a
			convex lens to begin to bend the light before it reaches the cornea (b). In the case of
			myopia, the light rays focus in front of the retina. This is corrected using a concave
			lens to diverge the light rays before it reaches the cornea (c).</p>
