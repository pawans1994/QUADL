In order to respond and maintain homeostasis, we must be able to detect that a change has happened in the first place. The nervous system is well adapted to carry out this specific function, by converting various internal and external stimuli into electrical signals in the form of post-synaptic potentials or action potentials. Any action potentials generated are then carried along neurons, and various forms of electrical signals at synapses and neural networks are integrated for decision making purposes. Not all stimuli are used only for homeostasic maintenance, with sensory input playing a role in all kinds of reflex and conscious responses as well.</p><p id="d028777d1b154ce1acc5c15d8da19c28">In this section we will look more closely at how the nervous system converts physical and chemical signals such as touch, taste, light, sound, and others into electrical signals that can be interpreted and processed by the central nervous system in a manner that allows us to perceive them. This overall process of sensing and interpreting these signals is called sensation. For the purposes of study, sensation is typically divided into general and special senses. Regardless of whether it is a general or special sense, the signal is received by receptors that then convey information to the CNS.</p></body></workbook_page>
