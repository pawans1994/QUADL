		<p>The information sensed by the spiral organ of the cochlea is transmitted into the brain
			via the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) to nuclei in the pons. At the level
			of the pons and related connections in the midbrain, some processing of auditory
			information occurs, including identifying where a sound is coming from and responding to
			loud noises. From the pons and midbrain, fibers carrying auditory information project to
			the thalamus and then, from there to the primary auditory cortex of the temporal lobe.
			It is here that the conscious perception of sound is located.</p>

			<caption>The structures of the ear convert sound waves into a neural signal by moving the
				“hairs” or stereocilia of the cochlear duct. Specific locations along the length of the
				duct encode specific frequencies or pitches. And the brain interprets all the sounds
				that are heard into the complex perceptions of music or speech.</caption>

		<!--<p>describe_ear_impulses_digt1: What part of the ear structures are responsible for the large amplification of
			sound from the external to inner ear?</p>
		<p>Answer: The small bones in the middle ear, the ossicles, amplify sound between the
			tympanic membrane and the oval window of the inner ear.</p>-->

			<caption>This brief animation takes a trip into the inner ear and shows the cochlea
			unrolling with the base at the back of the image and the apex at the front. As sounds
			are played a specific location on the cochlear duct is shown to vibrate as might happen
			in the course of the actual function of the inner ear. The vibrations are arranged along
			the length of the duct in a very ordered way, much like the keys on a piano
			keyboard.</caption>

		<!--<p>describe_ear_impulses_digt2 Question: Based on the animation, where do frequencies, from high to low pitches, cause
			activity in the hair cells within the cochlear duct?</p>
		<p>Answer: High frequencies activate hair cells towards the base of the cochlea and low
			frequencies activate hair cells towards the apex of the cochlea.</p>-->
