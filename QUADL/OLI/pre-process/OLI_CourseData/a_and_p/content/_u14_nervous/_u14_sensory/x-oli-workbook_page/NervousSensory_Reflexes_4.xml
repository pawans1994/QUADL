		<p>When first jumping into cool water, you may endure a wave of sensory information
			“reminding you” that the water is cool. Yet minutes later, you may be “used to” the
			water temperature, or have adapted to it. This change in perception did not occur
			because the water warmed up, but because the sensory receptors that originally responded
			to the change in temperature are no longer sending signals to the CNS, or are sending
			them at a decreased rate. This example indicates how a rapidly adapting receptor might
			function; it provides significant signals to the CNS about the original change in
			temperature that the body experiences, but then adapts such that it sends fewer signals
			thereafter.</p>
		<p>Not all sensory receptors are rapidly adapting. Certain pain receptors seem to have
			little adaptation, or are very slowly adapting, so that as long as the pain stimulus is
			applied, the person continues to “get the message”! The general rates of adaptation for
			specific sensory receptors are indicated in Table A.</p>
