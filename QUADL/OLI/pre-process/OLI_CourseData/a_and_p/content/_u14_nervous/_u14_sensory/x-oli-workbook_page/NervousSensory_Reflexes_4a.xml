			<p>We have all felt pain, and although uncomfortable, it likely provided us important
			information about tissue damage -- damage that may have gotten worse if pain had not
			made us aware of the problems at hand. In response to pain we tend to “protect” the
			damaged tissue from further use and seek appropriate medical attention. Thus pain is a
			critical sensation for alerting us to problems within the body such that they can be
			appropriately addressed.</p>
