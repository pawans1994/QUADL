			<p>This region is referred to as
			the <term>olfactory epithelium</term> and contains bipolar sensory neurons with
			dendrites extending from the apical surface of the epithelium into the mucus lining the
			nasal cavity. As airborne molecules are inhaled through the nose, they pass over the
			olfactory epithelium and dissolve into the mucus. The <term>odorant</term>
				molecules bind to proteins that keep them dissolved in the mucus and help transport
			them to the olfactory dendrites. The odorant-protein complex binds to a receptor protein
			on the membrane of the olfactory cell. The olfactory odorant receptors are G-protein
			coupled receptors that will cause a transient depolarization in membrane potential that
			will lead to an action potential if the stimulus is strong enough.</p>
