			<title>The Autonomic Nervous System at Work</title>
			<p>Josie is sitting, having an outdoor lunch with friends when a large spider lands on
				her plate. She immediately freezes, the food in her mouth begins to feel like
				a wad of dry hay, and she nearly gags as she tries to swallow it. She feels her
				heart race and pound in her chest. After swallowing her food, it seems stuck in her
				throat and chest.</p>
			<p>In this scenario, Josie had been sitting, relaxed and enjoying a meal. In this relaxed 
				state, the body would have a heart rate that is at rest, active peristalisis 
				(activity in muscles of the digestive system), ample activity in
				salivary glands and in digestive gland secretions, and bronchi that are not dilated.
				In this relaxed state, food can be easily processed due to ample amounts of saliva 
				and digestive enzymes in the saliva released by the salivary glands into the mouth.. Salivation also facilitates
				swallowing by providing lubrication to the back of the throat and the esophagus. In
				this relaxed state, digestive fluids and enzymes in the intestines are actively
				produced and secreted so that food can be further processed and broken down
				(catabolized) for absorption of nutrients and glucose. While relaxed, Josie's heart
				beats imperceptibly and her breathing is deep.</p>
			<p>With the sudden appearance of the spider, the rate of Josie's heart beat becomes more
				rapid, and it contracts more powerfully. In this vigilant state, Josie senses her
				rapid heart rate as well as the increased force of the contraction of her heart. She
				also senses a shift to rapid, shallow breathing that she tries to control. Her food
				seems lodged near the back of her throat as she struggles to swallow her food
				safely.</p>
			<p>Within seconds of seeing the spider, Josie's body systems shifted from reflecting 
				calm to a state of panic and hyper-vigilance. These responses to the
				external threat prepare Josie to either fight or flee the situation. In the
				hyper-vigilant state, Josie's pupils widen, she sweats and more blood is pumped
				through her blood vessels which permits more blood, chemicals, and hormones to flow
				to her skeletal muscles and respiratory system. As you can see, the effects on organ
				systems when in either of the states, relaxed or hyper-vigilant, are nearly
				opposite. These two states are controlled by two subsets of neural pathways that are
				part of the peripheral nervous system.</p>
		</example>
		<p>The <term>peripheral nervous system</term> itself has two main functional parts. These
			are the <term>somatic nervous system</term>, which controls voluntary movements of
			skeletal muscles, and the <term>autonomic nervous system</term>, which is the
			involuntary motor division of the nervous system. </p>

			<p>The
			autonomic nervous system is further divided into the sympathetic nervous system and the
				parasympathetic nervous system. It is the complementarity of these two
			latter branches of the autonomic nervous system that drove the physiological changes in
			the “Spider Sat Down Beside Her” scenario above.</p>


		<p>As evident from the impact of the sight of the spider on Josie's ability to eat her meal,
			activity in the parasympathetic system is associated with a relaxing meal;
			on the other hand, activity in the sympathetic system is associated with
			alertness and vigilance. In keeping with the complementary functionality of the two
			systems, they have been given nick names. The parasympathetic branch works for
				“rest and repose” (also commonly known as “rest and digest”); the
			sympathetic branch is known for the “fight or flight” response (variously also known as
			“fight, flight or freeze;” “hyperarousal;” “acute stress”). </p>

		<p>It will also be evident in later sections that both parasympathetic and
				sympathetic branches influence most organs, typically in opposition to
			each other. However, as will also be clear from the discussion going forward,
			physiologically this opposition is more complementary than antagonistic. One can give an
			example of a car, where the accelerator and brake are both necessary for its operation.
			The balancing that goes on between these two divisions of the ANS requires that most
			organs receive inputs from both. This is referred to as <term>dual innervation</term>.
			We will see examples of this later.</p>
