		<p> As noted previously, a balance of function in the autonomic nervous system is required to maintain a 
			living organism.  Activity in the autonomic nervous system is not a conscious endeavor that most people 
			can normally control (however, with practice, autonomic nervous system can be controlled to some extent 
			such as in deep meditation).  Sympathetic and parasympathetic functions that maintain homeostatic balance 
			and other internal body states are listed below.</p>
		
				<ul>
					<title>Parasympathetic Functions:</title>
					<li>Stimulates visceral activity</li>
					<li>Decreases metabolic rate</li>
					<li>Decreases heart rate and blood pressure</li>
					<li>Conserves energy and promotes sedentary activities</li>
					<li>Increased salivary gland secretion  (serous, and hence dilute)</li>
					<li>Increased digestive secretions</li>
					<li>Increased motility and blood flow in digestive tract</li>
					<li>Facilitation of urination and defecation.</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<title>Sympathetic Functions:</title>
					<li>Heightened mental alertness</li>
					<li>Increased metabolic rate</li>
					<li>Increased respiratory rate and dilation of respiratory passageways.</li>
					<li>Viscous saliva secretion  (higher protein content, less water)</li>
					<li>Increased heart rate and blood pressure</li>
					<li>Energy reserves activated</li>
					<li>Reduced digestive and urinary functions</li>
					<li>Sweat glands activated</li>
				</ul>
