		<p>As evident from the impact of the sight of the spider on Josie's ability to eat her meal, activity in the 
			<term>parasympathetic system</term> is associated with a relaxing meal; on the other hand, activity in the <term>sympathetic system</term>
			is associated with alertness and vigilance.  In keeping with the complementary functionality of the two systems, 
			they have been given nick names.  The parasympathetic branch works for <term>“rest and repose”</term> (also commonly known as 
			“rest and digest”); the sympathetic branch is known for the “fight or flight” response (variously also known as 
			“fight, flight or freeze;” “hyperarousal;” “acute stress”). </p>
		
		<p>It will also be evident later in this module that both <term>parasympathetic</term> and <term>sympathetic</term> branches influence most organs, 
			typically in opposition to each other.  However, as will also be clear from the discussion going forward, physiologically 
			this opposition is more complementary than antagonistic.  One can give an example of a car, where the accelerator and 
			brake are both necessary for its operation.  The balancing that goes on between these two divisions of the ANS requires 
			that most organs receive inputs from both. This is referred to as <term>“dual innervation.”</term>  We will see examples of this 
			later.</p>
