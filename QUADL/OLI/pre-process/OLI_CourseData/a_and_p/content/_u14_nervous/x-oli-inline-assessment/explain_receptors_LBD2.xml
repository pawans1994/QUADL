Which of the following receptors with a historical eponymous name is <em>not</em> involved in proprioception?</body><multiple_choice><choice value="a">Meissner corpuscle</choice><choice value="b">Pacinian corpuscle</choice><choice value="c">Ruffini corpuscle</choice><choice value="d">Golgi Tendon organ</choice></multiple_choice><part id="cf9d840421834e1bb1553eeb4a024fc5"><skillref idref="explain_receptors_SKILL" /><response match="a" score="10"><feedback>Correct. This is found in the superficial region of dermis where it detects light touch, not body position or movement.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is found in the deep region of dermis where it detects pressure and vibration</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is found in the dermis and associated with joints where it detects sustained pressure or changes in joint position, respectively.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is found in the tendon between muscle and bone, providing sensory input when tendons are slowly stretched.</feedback></response><hint>One reason many of these structures now have a different name is because the eponymous name doesnâ€™t give any hints about its structure, location or function. However, if you use the table to review their location and know what structures are involved in detecting body position and movement, you should be able to decide which one does not fit. </hint></part></question></assessment>
