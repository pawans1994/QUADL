        <body>The channels responsible for EPSP’s are sodium channels, while those responsible for IPSP’s are potassium and chloride channels.  Can you explain why?<input_ref input="q1_submit"/></body>

                <feedback>Due to the higher extracellular concentration of Na+, opening Na+-channels causes rapid inward diffusion of Na+ that leads to depolarization (less negative or positive on inside) of the cell membrane.  On the other hand, opening of K+-channel or the Cl—channel causes these ions to follow the concentration gradient out of the cell (K+) or into the cell (Cl-), respectively, leading to hyperpolarization (even more negative than resting potential on inside). </feedback>
