            <body>If the lacrimal gland is located lateral and superior to the eye organ, why do we tears flow form first at the medial corner of the eye? <input_ref input="qsub_0"/></body>

                <explanation>The lacrimal gland is producing tears all the time to keep the surface of the eye moist and wash away foreign particles.  These secretions normally flow down the lacrimal duct as quickly as they are produced.  When we cry, we are producing tears faster than they can enter the duct, so they back up and leak out of the medial corner where the duct opening is found.  This also accounts for the runny nose that often occurs with crying, since more tears than normal are still entering the nasal cavity through the lacrimal ducts.</explanation>
