This is a function of the endocrine system, not the nervous system. Those chemicals are called hormones.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is a correct function of the nervous system; some parts of the nervous system control voluntary skeletal muscles, while other parts control involuntary smooth and cardiac muscle and glands; hormones can also affect muscles and glands.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is a function of the nervous system, as opposed to the endocrine system which produces hormones for a slower but longer duration effect on sometimes distant body tissues and cells.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.
