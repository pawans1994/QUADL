    <question id="q1">
        <body>Lamellar (Pacinian) corpuscles that perceive  pressure also adapt quickly, reducing or stopping signal transduction despite continued mechanical pressure.  Explain how this physiological phenomenon relates to our sensation of knee position when walking versus sitting?<input_ref input="q1_sa"/></body>

            <response input="q1_sa" match="*" score="1"></response>
            <explanation>While walking, the receptors are detecting all the changes in movement and pressure.  However, when you sit down, you perceive the initial bending of your knees, but as you stay seated, the pressure perception is lost - unless you move again.  </explanation>
