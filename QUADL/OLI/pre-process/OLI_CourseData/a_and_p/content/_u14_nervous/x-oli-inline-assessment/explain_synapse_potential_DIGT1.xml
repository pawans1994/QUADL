    <question id="q1">
        <body>What type of summation achieves an action potential in a neuron resulting from simultaneous input of multiple other neurons?</body>
       <multiple_choice>
           <choice value="a">spatial summation</choice>
           <choice value="b">multiple summation</choice>
           <choice value="c">terminal summation</choice>
           <choice value="d">temporal summation</choice>
       </multiple_choice>
        <part>
            <response match="a" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. The input from Multiple  neurons at different locations on the postsynaptic neuron with receptors can add up to cause an action potential.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="b" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Even though this involves multiple stimulating neurons, this is not a physiological type of summation.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="c" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Even though this is happening between the axon terminal and its target, this is not a physiological type of summation.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="d" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Here the “adding” is being done over time at a single synapse, rather than from multiple neurons at one time.</feedback>
            </response>
            <!--<hint>One type of summation depends upon the location or “spacing” of several stimulating neurons at multiple synapses and the other depends on the “timing” of stimulation at a single synapse.</hint>-->
