            <body>This video gives an abbreviated overview of the visual system by concentrating on the pathway from the eyes to the occipital lobe. The video makes the statement (at 0:45) that “specialized cells in the retina called ganglion cells convert the light rays into electrical signals.” What aspect of retinal processing is simplified by that statement? Explain your answer. <input_ref input="q1_sc"/></body>

                    <explanation>Photoreceptors convert light energy, or photons, into an electrcochemical signal. The retina contains bipolar cells, and the RGCs that finally convert it into action potentials that are sent from the retina to the central nervous system. </explanation>
