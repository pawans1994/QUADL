Somatic reflexes only stimulate skeletal muscle; this is one of several distinctions between somatic and visceral reflexes; another distinction is the number of motor neurons involved between integration and effector.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is the distinction between monsynaptic and polysynaptic somatic reflexes.</feedback></response><hint>Remember each somatic reflex would fit in several categories; for example the crossed-extensor reflex described in next section would be an innate somatic polysynaptic contralateral reflex.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
