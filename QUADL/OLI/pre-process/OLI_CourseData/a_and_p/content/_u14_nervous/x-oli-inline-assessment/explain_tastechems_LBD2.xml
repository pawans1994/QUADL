This area doesn’t have the vallate papilla.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Bitter does seem to have a stronger taste far back on the tongue.</feedback></response><response match="E" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The hard and soft palate doesn’t have papilla even though it has some taste receptors. Not all taste receptors are in taste buds on the tongue. They are even found in the stomach (sweet) and lung airways (bitter).</feedback></response><hint>All parts of the tongue may have any of these receptors, so there is no correct “map” of the tongue for specific tastes. Detecting sour taste can also be a protective mechanism as an indication of spoiled food.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
