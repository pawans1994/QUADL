    <question id="q1">
        <body>What type of nociceptor and fiber is most likely activated to create the soreness you experience after an intense work out at the gym, especially if you havenâ€™t been doing so regularly? <input_ref input="q1_sa"/></body>
        <short_answer id="q1_sa"/>
        <part>
            <response input="q1_sa" match="*" score="1"></response>
            <explanation>Most likely you are experiencing stimuli from nociceptors associated with skeletal muscles and joints that are mechanoreceptors with slow, less precisely localized C fibers.  You may also have stimulated silent and chemoreceptors if your workout caused damage to muscle or other joint tissues and inflammation has occurred.  </explanation>
