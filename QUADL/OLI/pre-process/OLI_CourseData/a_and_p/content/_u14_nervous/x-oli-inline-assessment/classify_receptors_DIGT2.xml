    <question id="q1">
        <body>Chemoreceptor cells contain cell membrane proteins that detect chemical stimuli
            dissolved in fluids. What two body fluids are necessary in order for us to smell and
            taste? <input_ref input="chemoreceptor_sa"/></body>
        <short_answer id="chemoreceptor_sa"/>
        <part>
            <response input="chemoreceptor_sa" match="*" score="10"/>
            <explanation>The saliva dissolves chemicals in food so we can taste them and mucous of
                our nasal cavity dissolves airborne chemicals so we can smell them. If you dry off
                your tongue and hold your nose, you won’t be able to “taste” the difference between
                a piece of apple or a piece of potato. Much of what we perceive as “taste” is really
                smell – think about how things “taste” when you have congestion from a bad cold and
                can’t smell.</explanation>
