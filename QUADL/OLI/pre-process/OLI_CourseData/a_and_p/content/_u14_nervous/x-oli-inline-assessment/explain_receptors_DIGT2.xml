While it is sensitive, much of the sensitivity comes from the hair root plexus detecting movement of hair and not direct touch receptors.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This area has more widely distributed touch receptors but is more sensitive to pain than the correct choice.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="10"><feedback>Correct. These areas have the densest concentration of touch receptors, being very sensitive.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. These areas have more widely distributed touch receptors.</feedback></response><response match="e" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. While more sensitive than some of the other choices, it is not the most sensitive choice, especially with the extra stratum lucidum layer of thick skin.</feedback></response></part></question></assessment>
