            <body>Are you very sensitive to tastes? Can you see any similarities among the members of your family? <input_ref input="qpart_0"/></body>

                <explanation>For myself: I can eat most anything (except mushrooms!) so I don’t think I’m that sensitive to tastes. My whole family likes eating a variety of foods, so it seems that we all have the same level of sensitivity.</explanation>
