What glial cell is present for the A-delta fibers and lacking for the C fibers?</body><multiple_choice><choice value="a">oligodendrocytes</choice><choice value="b">Schwann cells</choice><choice value="c">microglia</choice><choice value="d">astrocytes</choice><choice value="e">satellite cells</choice></multiple_choice><part id="i9f6270947389450e9261555735d969cc"><skillref idref="compare_pain_fibers_SKILL" /><response match="a" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. While these do produce myelin they only do so in the central nervous system and unipolar sensory neurons are part of peripheral system.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Because of their presence, A-delta fibers can propagate action potentials by saltatory conduction, making the speed of transmission much faster.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. These glial cells are found only in the central nervous system and do not assist with myelination.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. These glial cells are found only in the central nervous system and do not assist with myelination.</feedback></response><response match="e" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. While these glial cells are found in the peripheral nervous system, they do not assist with myelination.</feedback></response><hint>Think back to the physiological processes that must occur in order for an action potential to be propagated. </hint></part></question></assessment>
