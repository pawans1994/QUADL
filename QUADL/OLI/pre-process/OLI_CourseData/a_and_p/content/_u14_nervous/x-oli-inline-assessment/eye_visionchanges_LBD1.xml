Presbyopia is the loss of ability to accommodate for looking at near objects. Lenses can also be used to correct for this change. Which type of lens would be used in this case?</body><multiple_choice id="qsub_0" shuffle="true"><choice value="A">concave</choice><choice value="B">convex</choice></multiple_choice><part id="qpart_0"><skillref idref="eye_visionchanges_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This would make the light rays diverge, making the image even more out of focus.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. This lens will bend the rays before it reaches the cornea, bringing the image into focus on the retina; if they have other focus problems they may need bifocal lenses to adjust for both conditions.</feedback></response><hint>Like hyperopia (far-sightedness), this would result in light rays that wouldnâ€™t focus until they reached behind the retina.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
