            <body>The spinal cord stops growing about at the age of 4 or 5, but the vertebral column continues to grow until around the end of puberty.  What evidence of this do you see from the gross anatomy you have just learned?</body>

                <explanation>The spinal column only extends about 2/3 of the way through the vertebral foramen, ending with the conus medulllaris at the level of the first lumbar vertebrae.  Even though the spinal roots extend within the vertebral formen to exit through inferior intervertebral foramen, the corresponding segment of the spinal cord where those roots arise are much more superior.</explanation>
