These association neruons with multiple dendrites communicate between sensory and motor neurons as well as among themselves in central nervous system.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Bipolar neurons are rare sensory neurons.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect, most are unipolar with one cell extension with a branch from sensory receptor to cell body in ganglion and a branch from cell body to central nervous system.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect, most are multipolar, with many dendrites and cell body in the central nervous system and only the axon extending out into the body to muscles or glands.</feedback></response><response match="E" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect, bipolar neuron classification has nothing to do with the psychiatric diagnosis of the disorder; bipolar neurons are rare sensory neurons.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
