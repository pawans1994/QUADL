            <body>Although the chemical synapse is “slower” than electrical synapse, most neurons use chemical synapses, which involve about a millionth of a second.  What is the advantage of a chemical synapse?</body>

                <explanation>The chemicals (neurotransmitters) released at the chemical synapse can be both excitatory and inhibitory and their quantity can vary, allowing integration of information from multiple presynaptic neurons.  In contrast, electrical synapses allow only quick propagation of the existing action potential for a simultaneous response among multiple cells.</explanation>
