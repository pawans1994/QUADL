These are the raised bumps on the tongue visible with the naked eye; they protect the receptor.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. This receptor is found one of many taste buds associated with the papilla of the tongue.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This structure includes many receptors but also includes other support cells, so you need a more specific level of organization.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is one of the sub-modalities of taste and not a structure.</feedback></response><response match="E" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is stimulated by the receptor cell but cannot itself respond directly to dissolved molecules in the saliva.</feedback></response><hint>The receptor cell is not a neuron, but is protected. It responds directly to chemical stimuli and releases neurotransmitters that activate sensory neurons.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
