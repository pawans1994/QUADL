They can’t detect pain, especially in appendicular parts of body and mouth. As a result, they often injure themselves without being aware of the damage. They also frequently don’t sweat and are susceptible to hyperthermia.</p><p id="a3c1dbf1165d4464a534f331a582d89d">Explain why the fact that our nociceptors don’t typically adapt is a protective mechanism. <input_ref input="q1_sa" /></p></body><short_answer id="q1_sa" whitespace="trim" case_sensitive="false" /><part id="cee3ea37272346ee8b122b8ffc3fb8c9"><response match="*" score="1" input="q1_sa"><feedback><p id="af5b9c76eb4d346e2bb7865fe8b6b1218">As long as there is tissue damage, the receptors will continue to send signals, even with continued stimulation and damage. As a result, we will be aware of the damage and be able to protect that area to minimize any further damage.</p></feedback></response><explanation><p id="ad083787521cd4d6a943a430cbf812369">As long as there is tissue damage, the receptors will continue to send signals, even with continued stimulation and damage.
