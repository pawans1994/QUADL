            <body>Some liquid medicines have a chemical added that specifically binds to G-protein coupled receptors for alkaloids but does not depolarize the cell membrane.  What would be their purpose? <input_ref input="qpart_0"/></body>
            <short_answer id="qpart_0"/>

                <response input="qpart_0" match="*" score="10"/>
                <explanation>Many medicines contain alkaloids that are bitter, so this acts as a bitter block and makes the medicine taste less bitter, so patients would be more likely to take their medication as prescribed.  This negates the need to add sweet chemicals to make it a little more palatable.  Future research on the proposed fat receptor could include identifying chemical blocking strategies to reduce the taste attraction to fat as a method to help manage obesity in some people.</explanation>
