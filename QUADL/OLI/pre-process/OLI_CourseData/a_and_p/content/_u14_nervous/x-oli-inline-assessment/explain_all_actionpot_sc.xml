            <body>Both graded potentials and action potentials can involve Na+ and K+ channels.  What is different in how these channels behave that creates the different types of potentials?</body>

                <explanation>Graded potentials will open or close Na+ and K+ channels in response to various stimuli but when they do they create only small localized change in membrane potential.  For an action potential, a voltage-gated Na+ channel opens in response to voltage change and causes a standardized large and quick change in membrane potential and K+ channels open slower while Na+ channels close.  This sets up a propagation of action potentials sequentially along the axon at same strength in one direction.</explanation>
