This tight cell junction of brain capillaries is important in preventing potentially harmful substances in blood from reaching neurons in brain tissue.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This tight cell junction between these glial cells is important in preventing potentially harmful substances in blood from reaching neurons in brain tissue.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. While ependymal cells have cilia to help move CSF among the fluid-filled spaces, it does not contribute to the selective permeability that protects neurons from potentially harmful substances in the blood.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Both the blood capillary endothelial cells and ependymal cells produce this extracellular membrane that helps limit what can move from blood capillary space into ventricle space to become CSF.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
