Chronic pain is associated with both slow somatic and slow visceral receptors with C fibers.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Skin nociceptors can generate either fast pain or the more slowly conducted burning or aching pain, depending upon their fiber type.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Nociceptors do not usually adapt, as it is important that we continue to perceive pain in order to help prevent further injury.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The quick response will initiate a protective withdrawal reflex. Some of the pain sensation may be slightly delayed if nociceptors with C fibers are also activated.</feedback></response><hint>Think about the speed of transmission being described and the type of fiber that would be needed to accomplish this.</hint></part></question></assessment>
