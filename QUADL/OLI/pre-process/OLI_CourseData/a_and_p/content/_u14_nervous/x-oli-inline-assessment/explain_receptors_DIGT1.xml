    <question id="q1">
        <body>If a physiologist wanted to study the differences in somatic and visceral reception from muscle tissue, they would compare the characteristics of nerve impulse transduction and propagation from smooth muscle to what other kind of tissue? <input_ref input="q1_sa"/></body>
