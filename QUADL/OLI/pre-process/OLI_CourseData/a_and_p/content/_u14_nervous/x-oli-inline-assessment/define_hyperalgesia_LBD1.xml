    <question id="q1">
        <body>The term <em>hyperalgesia</em> comes from the Greek roots “hyper-” meaning “over” and “-algos” meaning “pain”.  The increased pain perception comes from sensitization of the normally silent mechanoreceptors.   Another term, <em>allodynia</em> comes from the Greek roots “allos” meaning “other” and “odune” also meaning “pain”.  The change in this instance occurs within the central nervous system neurochemistry, not in the peripheral receptors. An example of this “other pain” is when it hurts to have your shirt touch your skin after a sunburn.  What is the main difference between hyperalgesia and allodynia? <input_ref input="q1_sa"/></body>

            <hint>Think about the difference of typical depth in skin for most silent mechanoreceptors compared to the depth of receptors associated with light touch.</hint>
            <explanation>Allodynia is used to describe pain from a stimulus that normally would not be able to stimulate pain receptors, such as light touch stimulating pain receptors near the epidermis/dermis border.  The changes occur within the central nervous system, not the receptor.  Hyperalgesia is used to describe the increased sensation of pain from a stimulus that would normally stimulate only pressure receptors if the silent pain receptors themselves in the peripheral nervous system were not sensitized.  The change occurs with the receptors in the peripheral nervous system.</explanation>
