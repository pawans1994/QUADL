    <question id="q1">
        <body>What happens to a postsynaptic cell membrane if chloride channels open as a result of neurotransmitter binding?</body>
       <multiple_choice>
           <choice value="a">IPSP (inhibitory postsynaptic potential) is achieved.</choice>
           <choice value="b">EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential) occurs</choice>
           <choice value="c">The cell membrane depolarizes</choice>
           <choice value="d">The cell membrane repolarizes </choice>
       </multiple_choice>
        <part>
            <response match="a" score="10">
                <feedback>Correct. Chloride ions will diffuse into the cell and since they are negatively charged it will hyperpolarize the membrane causing an IPSP.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="b" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. EPSP will occur when positive ions, such as sodium or chloride moves into the cell making it less negative.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="c" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Depolarizing is the result of an EPSP when positive ions, such as sodium or chloride moves into the cell making it less negative.</feedback>
            </response>
            <response match="d" score="0">
                <feedback>Incorrect. Although the change in charge (more negative on inside of membrane) is the same, repolarization is the phase of returning to resting membrane after a depolarization not the result of a neurotransmitter binding to postsynaptic membrane.</feedback>
            </response>
            <hint>Negatively charged chloride ions are more concentrated outside the cell membrane and will follow their concentration gradient to diffuse across an open membrane channel.</hint>
