This is part of the brainstem with central gray matter nuclei controlling some involuntary body functions.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The myelinated white matter of the cerebellum is arranged in the arbor vitae, which means “tree of life” .</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is part of the brainstem with central gray matter nuclei, including one that looks dark (substantia nigra) because of high levels of melanin and one that looks red (red nucleus) because of vasculature and high levels of iron.</feedback></response><response match="E" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is a gray matter feature that extends from midbrain through the cerebellum, not a white matter structure.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
