            <body>Spinal nerves differ from cranial nerves in number of pairs and origin (brain versus spinal cord).  What would be a functional difference between them?</body>

                <explanation>Cranial nerves can be sensory only, motor primarily or mixed nerves with both sensory and motor.  All spinal nerves are mixed with both sensory and motor components because they form from the fusion of the posterior and anterior spinal roots.</explanation>

            <body>Would a spinal nerve have afferent or efferent transmission or both?  Explain your reasoning.</body>

                <response input="qsub_1" match="*" score="10"/>
                <explanation>The posterior root has afferent (sensory) transmission and anterior root has efferent (motor) transmission.  Since spinal nerves are formed by fusion of these posterior and anterior spinal rootlets, they would have both transmissions within that mixed nerve.</explanation>
