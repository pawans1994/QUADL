            <body>You see someone about to touch a hot pan, but just before they touch it they stop and
                withdraw their hand, preventing a serious burn to the skin of their hand. What
                evidence do you have that this was <em>not</em> a somatic reflex?<input_ref input="qsub_0"/></body>
            <short_answer id="qsub_0"/>
            <part id="qpart_0">
                <response input="qsub_0" match="*" score="10"></response>
                <explanation>Because they didnâ€™t actually touch the pan, there was no sensory input
                    to initiate the involuntary reflex to stimulate the motor response of quickly
                    withdrawing their hand. Instead, they initiated a voluntary motor response that
                    prevented stimulation of that receptor based on other sensory input being
                    consciously interpreted and linked to conscious learned behavior or
                    memory.</explanation>
