Even if the chemical causing tissue damage doesn’t directly stimulate the nociceptor, the chemicals produced by damaged tissue cells will stimulate chemoreceptive nociceptors.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Even though people can be sensitive to light and feel pain, such as during migraine headache, the photoreceptor is not directly acting as a nociceptor; instead the signal produced in response to light that normally sets the body’s circadian rhythm is stimulating sensitized neurons in the brain that create the perception of pain.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. These nociceptors are stimulated by intense mechanical stimulation.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. These nociceptors are stimulated by extreme cold or heat stimulation.</feedback></response><hint>An external stimulus can be detected by a receptor and make a different nociceptor or neuron more sensitive without directly stimulating the nociceptor itself.</hint></part></question></assessment>
