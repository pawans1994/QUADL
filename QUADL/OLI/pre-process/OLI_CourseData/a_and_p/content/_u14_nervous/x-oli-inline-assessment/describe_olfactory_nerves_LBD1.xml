This is correct for both types of receptors, although not all taste receptors use this mechanism.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is correct for both receptors.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Although both are exposed the environment and do become damaged, only taste receptors are specialized epithelial cells; smell receptors are bipolar neurons with the unique ability to be replaced.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.

This is correct for both receptors.</feedback></response><hint>Think about what makes the smell receptor unique anywhere in the body.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
