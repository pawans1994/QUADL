    <question id="q1">
        <body>There are times when surgeons will perform what is called “awake brain surgery”.  The scalp is numbed and the patient receives some sedation, but does not lose consciousness.  The patient may be asked questions and respond during the surgery.  Based on your knowledge of nociceptor distribution, explain how this is possible.<input_ref input="q1_sa"/></body>

            <explanation>The brain and spinal cord tissue does not contain nociceptors.  So a headache is not pain coming from the brain itself.  The pain is coming from stimulation of nociceptors associated with other tissues around the nervous tissue of the brain, such as meninges or blood vessels, or from other structures in the head, such as muscles, sinuses, or eyes. </explanation>
