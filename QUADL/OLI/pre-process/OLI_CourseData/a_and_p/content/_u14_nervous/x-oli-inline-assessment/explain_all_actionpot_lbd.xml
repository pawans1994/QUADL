Action potentials are irreversible.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Graded potentials change in strength but action potential does not change in strength as it travels along axon.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Action potentials are all-or-none.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Action potentials are all excitatory.</feedback></response><response match="E" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The trigger zone has many voltage-gated channels that can start the action potential and they are also involved in the propagation of action potential on axon.</feedback></response><hint>Graded potentials are also known as local potentials that can initiate the propagation of an action potential that travels one direction from trigger zone to axon terminal very quickly.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
