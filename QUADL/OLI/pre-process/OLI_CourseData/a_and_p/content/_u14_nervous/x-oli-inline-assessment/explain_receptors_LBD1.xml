This is correctly paired; these receptors can detect temperature changes and pain from tissue damage in the skin. They are also found in organ capsules.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is correctly paired; this receptor can help prevent damage by initiating reflexes that prevent overstretching of tendons.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Tactile receptors would be in the epidermis and dermis of the skin, so they would be associated with the somatic sense, not visceral senses.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is correctly paired; this receptor detects the filling and emptying of the stomach to coordinate the digestive process.</feedback></response><hint>One way of classifying receptors is by location; whether they are located in integumentary and skeleto-muscular system or in the other visceral body systems. Keep in mind that some receptor types can be found in organs of both categories.</hint></part></question></assessment>
