But aging changes in what other lens structure could also cause this problem?</body><multiple_choice id="qsub_0" shuffle="true"><choice value="A">iris</choice><choice value="B">cornea</choice><choice value="C">ciliary muscles</choice></multiple_choice><part id="qpart_0"><skillref idref="eye_visionchanges_SKILL" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This will only change the size of the pupil, not change the lensâ€™ ability to accommodate.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This could cause another problem called astigmatism if the surface is out of shape, but not affect accommodation.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. With age the smooth muscle could lose its ability to contract, thus losing ability to relax the tension of the suspensory ligaments for accommodation.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
