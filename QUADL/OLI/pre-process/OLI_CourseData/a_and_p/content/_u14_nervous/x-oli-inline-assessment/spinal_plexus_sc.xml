                <hint>Think about some of the targets of the nerves extending distally to the plexus, with mixture of nerve fibers from more than one spinal nerve.</hint>
                <explanation>Damage to a single spinal nerve is less likely to result in complete loss of some critical motor functions, such as the phrenic nerve that goes to the diaphragm for breathing, or others innervating the upper and lower limbs.   These peripheral body parts would still be able to send sensory and receive motor control through the spinal cord via alternate spinal nerves superior or inferior to the damage.  If, however, the spinal cord itself was damaged, the plexus would not be able to compensate.</explanation>
