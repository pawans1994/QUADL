            <body><p>When stimulating the muscle spindle receptor with a reflex hammer, the detected
                muscle stretch causes a reflex where the muscle responds by quickly extending the
                knee joint<!--(Figure X)-->. Such a rapid contraction can put significant tension on the
                the tendon of the muscle that is sensed by the tendon sense organ.</p> 
                
                <p>To prevent damage to the tendon or its attachment to bone, what type of reflex would you predict the
                    tendon sense organ would initiate? <input_ref input="qsub_0"/></p></body>

                <explanation>Stimulation of the tendon stretch organ will result in muscle
                    inhibition (relaxation), thus preventing tendon damage. The tendon reflex is an
                    ipsilateral somatic reflex that is the opposite of the stretch
                    reflex.</explanation>
