                <explanation>When we are faced with a situation that demands our earnest attention – that is, whether to “fight or run” – our brain needs to receive as much oxygen it can get (for information processing); our respiratory passageways need to open up for moving as much air as possible; the heart needs to pump more blood to mover oxygen to the needed organs (brain and skeletal muscles).  When we are faced with such a situation, it is unlikely that we will have time to eat (or even feel like eating), nor will we have the time to waste on going to the bathroom; hence these functions will not be facilitated.  Since the blood flow has to increase to other more important organs, peripheral arteries (integumentary) will be constricted to limit blood-flow towards the body surface.  As a result, we also feel cold.</explanation>
