As a result, the brain misinterprets the source of the pain as coming from the more commonly stimulated dermal region, rather than the internal organ. Understanding the dermatome map can help explain why certain diseases are “felt” in other parts of the body.</p></content><question id="define_dermatome_LBD1_0"><body><p id="aa7ce1151cdab4695a8d7e614582517f9">Pain receptors associated with heart muscle enter the spinal cord in dorsal roots of spinal nerves T1 to T4.
