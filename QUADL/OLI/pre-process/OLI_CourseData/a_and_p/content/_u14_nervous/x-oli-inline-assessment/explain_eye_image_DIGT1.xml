This is the process of the lens changing shape of lens to adjust for looking at near objects.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The bending of light as it passes from one medium to another allows the image to be compressed to the back retina of the eye.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This is the process involved when the iris reduces pupil size in response to bright light conditions or looking at near objects.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
