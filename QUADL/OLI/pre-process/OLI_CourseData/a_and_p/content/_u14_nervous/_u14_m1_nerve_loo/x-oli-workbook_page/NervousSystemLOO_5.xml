		<p>To understand the basis of the resting membrane potential, we must first investigate the
			composition of body fluids - intracellular fluid (ICF) and extracellular fluid (ECF).
			Recall that ICF and ECF are composed of salts like NaCl and KCl that dissociate into
			their ionic components when placed in aqueous solutions. These ions are the mobile
			charges in body fluids that move between compartments to generate electrical currents
			along cell membranes.</p>

		<p>The ECF and ICF have high concentrations of different salts, which leads to differing
			concentrations of individual ions in the ECF versus the ICF. Recall from your earlier
			studies that sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>), and calcium
				(Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are more highly concentrated in the ECF, while potassium
				(K<sup>+</sup>) and large anions (An<sup>-</sup>) are more highly concentrated in
			the ICF.</p>
