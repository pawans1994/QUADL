		<p>Neurons produce electrical signals as a way of conveying information from one place in
			the body to another place very quickly, at speeds up to 100 meters/second (200 miles per
			hour). These rapidly traveling electrical signals allow you to perceive sensory stimuli,
			like the sound of a passing fire truck blasting its siren. Electrical signals,
			travelling in different neural pathways, coordinate motor responses that allow you to
			move your car out of the way of the fire truck, withdraw your hand from a dangerously
			hot pan, and rhythmically contract your diaphragm to breathe. Electrical signals arise
			as a result of movement of ions back and forth across the cell membrane of neurons. As
			ions move down their electrochemical gradients, they carry their charge with them,
			creating very miniscule but physiologically important electrical currents. These ionic
			currents flowing across membranes are the basis for the propagating electrical signals
			that underlie all nervous system functions. In this section, weâ€™ll explore how neurons
			generate these electrical signals.</p>
