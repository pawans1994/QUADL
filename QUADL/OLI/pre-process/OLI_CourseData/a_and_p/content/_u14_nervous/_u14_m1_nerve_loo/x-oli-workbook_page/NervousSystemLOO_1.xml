				<p>Neuronal axons in the CNS and PNS can be devoid of a glial cell wrap
					(unmyelinated) or they can be discontinuously wrapped by glial cells along their entire
					length (myelinated). In a myelinated axon, the bare regions where the sheath is
					interrupted are called <term>Nodes of Ranvier</term>. The myelinated segments
					between consecutive nodes of Ranvier are called <term>internodes</term>. The
					myelin sheath changes the appearance of axons as well as their electrical properties.
					Myelinated axons appear white when viewed by the naked eye in contrast to areas where
					neuronal cell bodies are concentrated which appear gray.</p>
