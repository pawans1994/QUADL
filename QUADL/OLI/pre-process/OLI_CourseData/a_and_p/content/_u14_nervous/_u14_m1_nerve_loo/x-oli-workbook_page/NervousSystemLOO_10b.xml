		<p>The cell that delivers the signal to the synapse is the <term>presynaptic cell</term>. The cell that will receive the signal once it
					crosses the synapse is the <term>postsynaptic cell</term>. Since most
					neural pathways contain several neurons, a postsynaptic neuron at one synapse
					may become the presynaptic neuron for another cell downstream.</p>
		
		
		
				<p>A presynaptic neuron can form one of three types of synapses with a postsynaptic
					neuron. The most common type of synapse is an axodendritic synapse, where the
					axon of the presynaptic neuron synapses with a dendrite of the postsynaptic
					neuron. If the presynpatic neuron synapses with the soma of the postsynaptic
					neuron it is called an axosomatic synapse, and if it synapses with the axon of
					the postsynaptic cell it is an axoaxonic synapse. Although our illustration
					shows a single synapse, neurons typically have many (even 10,000 or more)
					synapses.</p>
