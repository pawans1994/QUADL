			<p>All living, eukaryotic cells have a <term>transmembrane potential</term> (a
				difference in charges between the intracellular and extracellular fluid)<em style="bold"
				>. </em>While the cell is at rest (i.e., unstimulated), the transmembrane potential
			is stable and is called the <term>resting membrane potential (RMP)</term>.
				Right at the cell membrane, there is a little excess negative charge on the inside of
			the cell membrane and a little excess of positive charge on the outside. Because
			separation of charges creates a voltage, a very small probe on a voltmeter can be used
			to measure the voltage across the cell membrane. By convention the voltage outside the
			cell is set to zero. In a typical cell, the voltage recorded across the membrane is between -60 and -90 millivolts(-.06 to -.09 volts) with the negative sign indicating that the
			inside of the cell is negative with respect to the outside. Some cells have the ability
			to transiently alter their transmembrane potential (excitable cells), while others do
			not (non-excitable cells).</p>
		<p><term>Non-excitable cells</term> (ex: intestinal epithelial cells) have a stable
			and unchanging RMP. <term>Excitable cells</term>, like neurons and muscle, have
			a membrane potential that can fluctuate under certain conditions, with each fluctuation
			representing a signal produced by the cell. These fluctuations may be small and local to
			a region of a cell membrane (often called <term>local</term> or <term>graded
				potentials</term>) or larger in magnitude and travel along the length of the cell.
			These latter potentials, called <term>action potentials</term>, always lead to
			some response by the cells. In a neuron, action potentials lead to neurotransmitter
			release.</p>

			<caption>The resting
				membrane potential (measured as a voltage) is an energy gradient across the cell
				membrane due to a slight separation of charge right along the cell membrane. This work by Cenveo is licensed under a
