So how does the signal pass from one neuron to the next along a neural pathway? The signal must be transmitted across the interface between successive neurons and we will learn how that is accomplished in this next section.</p><image id="b51f092144c142a0af8bf1f189e311ee" src="../../webcontent/Nerv_46.jpg" alt="Synapse cells." style="inline" vertical-align="middle" width="400"><caption><p id="ed3328542edc4fb896fc3e076f96e5c9">Synapse cells.

Although one can use the word synapse to mean any cellular junction, in physiology we traditionally limit its usage to: the junction of two neurons, the junction between a neuron and a target cell (for example, the neuromuscular junction), or the interface between adjacent cardiac muscle cells or adjacent smooth muscle cells. In the nervous system, a synapse is the structure that allows a neuron to pass an electrical or chemical signal to another cell.</p></body></workbook_page>
