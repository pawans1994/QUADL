		<title>Axons: White and Gray Matter</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>As discussed above, neuronal axons in the CNS and PNS can be devoid of a glial cell wrap
			(unmyelinated) or they can be discontinuously wrapped by glial cells along their entire
			length (myelinated). In a myelinated axon, the bare regions where the sheath is
			interrupted are called <em style="bold">nodes of Ranvier</em>. The myelinated segments
			between consecutive nodes of Ranvier are called <em style="bold">internodes</em>. The
			myelin sheath changes the appearance of axons as well as their electrical properties.
			Myelinated axons appear white when viewed by the naked eye in contrast to areas where
			neuronal cell bodies are concentrated which appear gray.</p>
		<p><em style="bold">Image Caption: </em>Schwann cells in the PNS wrap axons to form a myelin
			sheath and also to loosely envelope non-myelinated axons</p>
