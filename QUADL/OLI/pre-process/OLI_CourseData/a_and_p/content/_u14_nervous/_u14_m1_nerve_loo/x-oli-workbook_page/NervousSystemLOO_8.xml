		<p>If there is adequate excitatory stimulation of a neuron, a signal called an <term>action potential</term> is generated. An action potential is a transient
			and marked shift in membrane potential that occurs when voltage-gated ion channels in
			the membrane open. A series of action potentials can rapidly carry information from the
			neural soma along the axon to the axon terminal. A sufficient number of voltage-gated
			channels must be present in the cell membrane to initiate an action potential. The
			dendrites and most of the soma lack enough voltage-gated ion channels for this. However,
			at the <term>trigger zone</term>, where the soma interfaces with the axon,
			there is a high concentration of voltage-gated channels. To create an action potential
			in a neuron, an excitatory local potential must reach the trigger zone and <term>depolarize</term> (a shift in membrane potential making it less negative
			or even positive) it to the threshold voltage needed to open the ion channels.</p>

		<p>Two types of voltage-gated channel are responsible for the propagating action potentials
			in most neurons – a <term>fast Na<sup>+ </sup>channel</term> (a voltage-gated Na<sup>+ </sup>channel that opens quickly
			when stimulated) and a <term>slow K<sup>+
			</sup> channel </term>(a voltage-gated K<sup>+ </sup>channel that
			opens slowly when stimulated) . Let’s take a closer look at the specific events of an
			action potential.</p>
		<p>Excitatory local potentials reach the trigger zone and depolarize it. If the local
			potentials depolarize the membrane to threshold (the membrane
			voltage at which the voltage-gated channels are stimulated to open), these voltage-gated
			channels begin to open. The fast Na<sup>+ </sup>channel opens quickly, increasing the
			permeability of the membrane to Na<sup>+</sup> that flows into the cell down
			its electrochemical gradient leading to further depolarization. This causes more fast
				Na<sup>+ </sup>channels to open, further depolarizing the membrane. As the membrane
			potential reaches 0 mV, the fast Na<sup>+ </sup>channels become “inactivated.” A second
			gate that works like a timer closes the channel. By the time all the fast Na<sup>+
			</sup>channels are inactivated the membrane voltage has reached its peak.</p>
		<p>As the fast Na<sup>+ </sup>channels are being inactivated, the slow K<sup>+
			</sup>channels are finally opening. This increases the permeability of the membrane to
				K<sup>+</sup>. Potassium ions leave the cell moving down their electrochemical
			gradient, and the efflux of positive charge causes the membrane voltage to return toward
			the resting membrane potential (<term>repolarization</term>).</p>
		<p>Slow K<sup>+ </sup>channels stay open longer than fast Na<sup>+ </sup>channels, so more
				K<sup>+ </sup>leaves the cell than Na<sup>+ </sup>entered. The removal of excess
			potassium ions causes the membrane potential to become more negative than the resting
			membrane potential. When this happens, we say the membrane is <term>hyperpolarized</term>.</p>
		<p>The changes in membrane permeability and their relationship to the membrane potential can
			be seen in the following figure.</p>
