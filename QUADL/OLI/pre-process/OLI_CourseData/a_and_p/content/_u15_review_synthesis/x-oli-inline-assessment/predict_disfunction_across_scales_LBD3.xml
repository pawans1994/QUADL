We need to be able reversibly add and remove muscle mass. If muscle cells die, there would not be a possibility for increasing muscle mass since muscle cells do not divide.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. These muscles are not used by they also reduce in size.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Cells undergo atrophy (loss of mass) and hypertrophy (increase in mass).</feedback></response><hint>When muscles grow with exercise, they hypertrophy.</hint><hint>Hypertrophy means that cells get bigger; cells do not divide to make more.</hint></part></question></assessment>
