This would shift the bicarbonate buffer equilibrium towards the right, which would result in greater blood hydrogen concentrations, and subsequently lower pH.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This would shift the bicarbonate buffer equilibrium towards the left, which would result in lower blood hydrogen concentrations, and subsequently greater pH.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This would result in less carbon dioxide production, which would shift the bicarbonate buffer equilibrium to the left. This would result in lower blood hydrogen concentrations, and subsequently greater pH.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. This would result in release of greater than usual amounts of carbon dioxide, which would shift the bicarbonate buffer equilibrium to the left. This would result in lower blood hydrogen concentrations, and subsequently greater pH.</feedback></response><hint>Consider the bicarbonate buffer system: CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ⇌ HCO<sup>-</sup><sub>3</sub> + H<sup>+</sup></hint></part></question></assessment>
