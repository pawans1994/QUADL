Oxygen binding to hemablobin at the nanoscale does not alter cell shape at the microscale.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Red cells squeeze through capillaries and tight spaces in the capillary beds of the lungs, liver and spleen.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Unless there is a serious pathological issue (such as malaria infection) red blood cells are not adhesive to vessel walls.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Red blood cells can interact with fibers, but they are not adhesive. platelets are.</feedback></response><hint>While flowing through the circulation, red blood cells regularly deform and regain their shape.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
