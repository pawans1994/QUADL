The body is stimulated to produce more red blood cells. </feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. There is a limit as to how much hemoglobin, and therefore iron, can go into each cell. </feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. There is a limit as to how much one red cell can do; that is why there are trillions in a healthy person at any time.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Oxygen is so poorly soluble in water that it needs to be carried in a special way, such as bound to an iron in hemoglobin</feedback></response><hint>In this case, the shortened lifespan of cells means fewer cells in circulation unless more can be produced.</hint></part></question></assessment>
