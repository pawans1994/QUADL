Although increased fat catabolism results in increased fatty acid release (acidosis), there are other factors that would result in a pH disturbance. </feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although loss of bicarbonate from diarrhea would result in acidosis, there are other factors that would result in a pH disturbance. </feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Although heavy activity results in increased amounts of lactic acid and subsequently acidosis, there are other factors that would result in a pH disturbance. </feedback></response><response match="d" score="1"><feedback>Correct. All of the above factors would result in a pH disturbance. A high fat diet results in acidosis via increased fatty acid release; severe diarrhea results in loss of bicarbonate, which causes acidosis; and heavy exercise results in acidosis from lactic acid buildup.</feedback></response></part></question></assessment>
