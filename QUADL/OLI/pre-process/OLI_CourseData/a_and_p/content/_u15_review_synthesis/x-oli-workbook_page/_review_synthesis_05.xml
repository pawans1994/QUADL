This pH must be kept within a narrow range (7.38 - 7.42). An increase in pH (alkalosis) or decrease in pH (acidosis) can result in profound effects within the body. For example, certain amino acids are sensitive to the pH in their environment. An unusual pH could result in conformational changes in proteins and subsequently a change in the proteinsâ€™ functions. </p><wb:inline idref="complete_loops_LBD2" purpose="learnbydoing" /><wb:inline idref="complete_loops_LBD3" purpose="didigetthis" /></example><example id="fc5b36c0a45843f6a4e12c6a095f9f8e"><title>Blood Glucose</title><p id="dcdb9ff426f8443f8216cd124819c3c6">Solute and water balance is maintained when solutes and water enter and exit the plasma at the same rate. When one material enters or exits the plasma faster than the other, a change in volume and/or composition occurs. The plasma concentrations of many substances are controlled by specific regulatory mechanisms. </p><wb:inline idref="define_identify_aspects_LBD1" purpose="learnbydoing" /></example><example id="b1a4f52183ea4fbc8e51116b7db75049"><title>Exercise</title><p id="d779a0282ce14d54942ccc3d0ca2ed96">Body muscles use the energy from ATP molecules to generate the force necessary to contract. A byproduct of this energy release is heat release. This results in an increase in body temperature during intensive exercise. The body compensates for extra heat by causing vasodilation of blood vessels near the skin and by causing sweat glands to release sweat. </p><wb:inline idref="define_identify_aspects_LBD2" purpose="learnbydoing" /></example></body></workbook_page>
