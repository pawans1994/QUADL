      <title>Review of the Themes of Anatomy and Physiology</title>
      <objref idref="review_intro_LO"/>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>In the introductory units we covered the major themes of anatomy and physiology, and we have addressed these themes as they relate to each specific organ system. In this review and synthesis unit we will present specific examples of how these themes relate to every aspect of physiology. We will present examples specific to different organ system units to review both the major themes and your understanding of the different organ systems. </p>
      <p>In this unit we will also examine pathological conditions related to anatomy and physiology focusing on two conditions: sickle cell anemia and obesity. Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disease that impacts specific populations. This condition is present at birth and is present throughout the individualâ€™s lifetime. On the other side of the spectrum, is obesity. Although there are some genetic factors which influence obesity, usually environmental and psychological factors are as much to blame for the pathologies associated with obesity. </p>
      <p>Through these examples of physiology and pathology, we will examine anatomy and physiology as it relates to: Structure and function, levels of organization, homeostasis, and integration of systems.</p>
