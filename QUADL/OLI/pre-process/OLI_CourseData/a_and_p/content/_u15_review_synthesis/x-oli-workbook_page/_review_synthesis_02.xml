      <p>As we’ve seen throughout this course, the human body is a complex, hierarchical system. We’ve studied each level separately and how each level builds to form, support and become a system. Let’s now take a closer look at how these levels of organizations integrate. </p>
      <example>
         <title>Electrical Conductivity in the Heart</title>
         <p>We can only live for a few minutes without the heart beating. This event, which occurs millions of times in a lifetime, is a function of many length scales within the cardiac tissue of the heart.</p>

      <example>
         <title>Oxygen for Cell Metabolism</title>
         <p>Obtaining oxygen is important for metabolism in every cell throughout the body. The respiratory system is dedicated to this exchange with the environment. Coordination of respiratory and cardiovascular function allows uptake of oxygen by respiration, exchange to the cardiovascular system, and distribution of oxygen through the body by the cardiovascular system.</p>
