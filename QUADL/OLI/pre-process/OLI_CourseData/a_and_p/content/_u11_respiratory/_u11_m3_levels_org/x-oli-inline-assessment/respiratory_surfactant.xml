Surface tension occurs because of the hydrogen bonding between water molecules. Surfactant contains phospholipids which can help disrupt the hydrogen bonding. </feedback></response><response name="tension" input="A" match="two" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Adhesion is the ability of water molecules to be attracted to unlike molecules and explains phenomena such as capillary action. </feedback></response><hint>The walls of the alveoli are so thin that the hydrogen bonds between water molecules need to be disrupted so the alveoli can open and close properly.</hint></part><part id="p2"><skillref idref="describe_function_surfacant" /><response name="inhalation" input="B" match="one" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The lack of surfactant during inhalation would result in the alveoli being harder to open or inflate. They would not collapse they would just stay closed. </feedback></response><response name="exhalation" input="B" match="two" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The lack of surfactant during exhalation can result in the alveoli collapsing once air has been expelled from them. </feedback></response><hint>The walls of the alveoli are so thin that the hydrogen bonds between water molecules need to be disrupted so the alveoli can open and close properly.</hint></part></question></assessment>
