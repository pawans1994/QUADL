About 7-10% of carbon dioxide is carried in the blood plasma as a dissolved gas. This is the form of carbon dioxide that can diffuse from the tissues into the blood.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Between 20%-23% of carbon dioxide is attached to hemoglobin molecules.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Most of the carbon dioxide (about 70-80%) is converted to bicarbonate ions and transported in the blood plasma.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
