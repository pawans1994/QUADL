A venous blockade can increase hydrostatic pressure resulting in a pleural effusion which is a buildup of excess fluid that can impede lung expansion. This fluid appears normal, the blockage just prevents proper drainage.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. If the lymphatic system is not able to drain the excess fluid the fluid can then build up creating a pleural effusion which can impede lung expansion. This fluid is transudate fluid because it is normal in appearance.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. A significant increase in protein usually indicates infection which would cause the fluid to be gray or cloudy and to be classified as exudates.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Transudate fluid is the result of impaired drainage of the lungs that results in a pleural effusion. This buildup of fluid is normal in appearance and does not have a higher protein or cell count.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
