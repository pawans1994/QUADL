Terminal Bronchioles- are the less than 0.5mm in diameter and will lead to the alveolar sacs which are like the leaves of the tree.</feedback></response><response name="bronchi" input="A" match="two"><feedback>Incorrect. The right and left primary bronchi branch off of the trachea after the last C-shaped cartilage, just like the two primary branches of this tree.</feedback></response><response name="trachea" input="A" match="three" score="10"><feedback>Correct.
