A person holding their breath is not inhaling or exhaling, which are the primary functions of pulmonary ventilation. This brings in a new supply of oxygen and releases excess carbon dioxide.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. A mucus buildup in the lungs would not prevent a person from inhaling or exhaling which is pulmonary ventilation. It would inhibit external respiration, which is the exchange of gas between the alveoli and the blood.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Carbon monoxide is a gas that binds to hemoglobin, it will not immediately disrupt pulmonary ventilation but will inhibit external and internal respiration because oxygen will not be able to bind to the hemoglobin and be carried in the blood.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The denaturing of carbonic anhydrase would affect the ability of the body to convert between bicarbonate and carbon dioxide which would affect gas exchange but not the physical process of pulmonary ventilation.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
