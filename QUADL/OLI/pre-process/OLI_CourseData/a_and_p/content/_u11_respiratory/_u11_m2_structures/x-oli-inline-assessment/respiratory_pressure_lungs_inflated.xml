Atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1 atm. This pressure is going to determining the ease at which air will flow into the lungs.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The alveolar pressure fluctuates from above 1 atm to below 1 atm depending on which stage of ventilation is occurring. This is going to allow air to enter or exit the body.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Intrapulmonary pressure is the pressure within the pleural space and will be slightly less than the pressure in the alveoli to prevent the lungs from collapsing.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Transpulmonary pressure plays a role in creating the air pressure gradient that will allow of the exchange of gasses.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
