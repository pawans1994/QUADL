Your expiratory reserve volume would increase but when it increases so will your vital capacity.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Your vital capacity would increase but in order to increase your vital capacity you must also increase your inspiratory reserve and expiratory reserve volumes.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="10"><feedback>Correct. All of the above would increase as your body became more adapted to large amounts of air coming in and being forced out of your lungs.</feedback></response><hint>Think which lines would have to increase if you were continually blowing into an instrument.</hint></part></question><question id="vital_capacity"><body>According to this graph vital capacity is equal to:</body><multiple_choice select="single" shuffle="true"><choice value="A">TLC plus RV</choice><choice value="B">TLC minus RV</choice><choice value="C">IRV plus ERV</choice><choice value="D">IRV minus ERV</choice></multiple_choice><part id="vital_capacity_p1"><skillref idref="interpret_spirogram" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.

The vital capacity is equal to the total lung capacity minus the residual volume. This will represent the maximum amount of air a person can expel from his or her lungs.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The vital capacity is equal to the Inspiratory reserve volume plus the expiratory reserve volume plus the tidal volume.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.
