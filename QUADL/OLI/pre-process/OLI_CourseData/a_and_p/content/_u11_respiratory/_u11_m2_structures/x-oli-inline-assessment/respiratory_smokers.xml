The function of the cilia is to create an escalator that moves mucus from the lungs up into the trachea. </feedback></response><response name="air" input="A" match="two" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Air moves in and out of the lungs because of the differences in pressures between inside of the lungs and outside the lungs. </feedback></response></part><part id="p2"><skillref idref="identify_function_coughing" /><response name="cough" input="B" match="one" score="10"><feedback>Correct. If the cilia are paralyzed or destroyed the body still needs to remove the mucus from the lungs. The reflex of coughing will provide the physical force to remove the mucus.</feedback></response><response name="sneeze" input="B" match="two" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. A sneeze is usually caused by an irritation of the nasal mucosa and is not used as a mechanism to remove mucus from deep in the lungs. </feedback></response></part><part id="p3"><skillref idref="differentiate_respiratory_disorders" /><response name="copd" input="C" match="one" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. COPD, is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is a broad category for diseases such as emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. These disease are characterized by obstruction of the airways and limitation to airflow. </feedback></response><response name="pneumonia" input="C" match="two" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The accumulation of mucus in the lungs can lead increased microbial growth. If the mucus cannot be moved out of the lungs then the bacteria can grow and cause disease such as pneumonia. </feedback></response></part></question></assessment>
