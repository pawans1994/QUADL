            <!--LO:Describe and distinguish between the conducting and respiratory zones of the respiratory tract.-->
            <body>In your own words explain why some experts recommend that you should breath
                through your nose when temperatures are low.</body>

                <explanation>When the temperature of the air is very cold it can cause damage to the
                    respiratory zone. It can also lead to lower enzyme function which can decrease
                    the ability of the body to convert between carbon dioxide and carbonic acid.
                    Breathing in through the nose is advantageous because the nasal cavity contains
                    the nasal conchae which help to warm and humidify the cold air before it enters
                    the trachea. The nostrils are also smaller in diameter so less air can enter and
                    be warmed at one time.</explanation>
