During normal expiration the muscles are relaxing but during forced expiration muscles such as the abdominal muscles and internal intercostals contract to further reduce the volume of the thoracic cavity which increases the pressure forcing more air out of the lungs. </feedback></response><hint>Remember to refer to the picture and that volume and pressure are inversely related. </hint></part></question></page><page><question id="respiratory_exhalation_q2"><body><p>In a situation such as screaming, the process of expiration becomes <input_ref input="A" /> process that primarily relies on the <input_ref input="B" /> of the <input_ref input="C" />.

As the diaphragm and external intercostals contract they shorten which actually increases the volume of the thoracic cavity because the external intercostals pull the chest walls out and the diaphragm flattens also increasing the volume of the thorax.</feedback></response><hint>Remember to refer to the picture and that volume and pressure are inversely related. </hint></part><part id="p5"><skillref idref="apply_process_exhalation" /><response name="increase" input="E" match="one" score="10"><feedback>Correct.

Air will flow from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. During expiration, the volume of the thoracic cavity decreases which increases the pressure of the lungs above the atmospheric pressure allowing air to exit the body.</feedback></response><hint>Remember to refer to the picture and that volume and pressure are inversely related. </hint></part></question></page></assessment>
