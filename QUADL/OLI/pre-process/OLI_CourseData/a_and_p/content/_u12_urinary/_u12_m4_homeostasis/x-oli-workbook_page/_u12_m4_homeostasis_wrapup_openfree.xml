			<body>
				<section>
					<title>Regulation of glomerular filtration</title>
					<body>
						<p>Glomerular filtration (GFR) remains relatively constant due to renal
							autoregulation. Renal autoregulation is comprised of:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The myogenic mechanism results from the vascular smooth muscle
								contracting when stretched.</li>
							<li>The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism that results in the macular
								densa cells responding to the filtrate’s high sodium concentration
								by releasing paracrine agent, that causes vasodialation diameter of
								the afferent arterioles and reduces blood flow.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>GFR is regulated by:</p>
						<ul style="none">
							<li><em style="bold">Sympathetic nerve fibers</em>: During extreme
								stress or blood loss, the sympathetic system will meet the needs of
								the whole body. The sympathetic nervous can override renal
								autoregulation and temporarily reduce kidney activity </li>
							<li><em style="bold">Hormones</em>: The enzyme renin produces
								angiotensin II. When blood pressure is low, Angiotensin II helps
								maintain pressure in the glomerular capillary and consequently, GFR </li>
							<li><em style="bold">Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)</em> increases GFR
								by relaxing the mesangial cells of the glomerulus, making more
								surface area available for filtration. This increases GFR. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>Hormonal Regulation of Reabsorption and Secretion.</p>
						<p>Five hormones control the absorption of water, sodium ions, chloride
							ions, and calcium ions:</p>
						<ul style="none">
							
							<li><em style="bold">Angiotensin II</em>: Angiotensin II stimulates the
								adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone. </li>
							<li><em style="bold">Aldosterone</em>: Aldosterone stimulates an
								increase in secretion of potassium and reabsorption of sodium ions
								and results in increased water reabsorption, leading to increased
								blood volume. </li>
							<li><em style="bold">Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</em>: ADH decrease urine
								production by increasing the water permeability of principal cells
								in the late distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct. This,
								increases facultative water reabsorption. </li>
							<li><em style="bold">Atrial natriuretic peptide</em>: This is released
								from the heart in response to large increases in blood volume. The
								action of ANP inhibit reabsorption of water and sodium ions in the
								proximal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. </li>
							<li><em style="bold">Parathyroid hormone (PTH)</em>: This is released by
								the parathyroid glands in response to a reduced concentration of
								calcium ions in the blood. It results in decrease in phosphate
								reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule and an increase in
								calcium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. </li>
							
						</ul>
						
						
						<section>
							<title>Aging and urinary system homeostasis</title>
							<body>
								<p>When taking all body systems into account, none undergoes as many
									age-related changes as the urinary system: </p>
								<ul>
									<li>decreased bladder capacity and bladder emptying,</li>
									<li>loss of sphincter muscle tone,</li>
									<li>reduced ability to delay voiding.</li>
									
								</ul>
							</body>
						</section>
						<p>Age-related conditions such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease can affect
							the micturition center in the brain. </p>

		  		<p>Before you do the quiz activity, please evaluate your understanding of the
					learning objectives for the Urinary Homeostasis and use the first
					My Response link below to ask any questions you might have about the material
					that you would like the instructor to address. Your questions can be for
					clarification of the material or further insight. Your self-evaluation will not
					be graded, but will be available for your instructor to read. Answering these
					questions may also shape the discussions in class. </p>

				<activity idref="_u12_m4_urinary_homeostasis_feedback" purpose="myresponse"/> 

					<p> If you do not feel ready for the quia, identify the objective(s) you need to
					review. Go back to those pages. Read the examples and do the activities. Don’t
					just read the activities, actually do them to get practice with the types of
					questions that will be in the quiz.</p>
				

				  <activity idref="u2_m3_checkpoint" purpose="checkpoint"/>

				<p> Now that you have finished the quiz, do you have any questions? Your instructor
					will be able to read the questions and comments that you submit. </p>
				 <activity idref="_u12_m4_urinary_homeostasis_feedback_post_quiz" purpose="myresponse"/>
