		<!-- <p>LEARNING OBJECTIVES: Integrate the levels of organization in the urinary system
					and their functional interconnections.</p>-->
		<p>The primary function of the urinary system is to maintain homeostasis of fluid and small
			molecules within the body. We will start with a molecular characterization of urine
			followed by molecular and tissue level descriptions of the structures that are
			responsible for the formation of the urine. Then we will follow the movement of material
			from the bloodstream, through the functional units of the kidney through the other
			organs of the urinary system, and out of the body.</p>

				<!-- <p>LEARNING OBJECTIVES: Identify the homeostatic properties of urine and causes of
					common imbalance. . Determine the physical and chemical properties of a urine
					sample and relate these properties to normal urine composition.
					
					Define chemical properties of urine and their functions.
					Describe normal urine composition.</p>-->
				<p>Our input of water varies greatly from day to day. Despite major differences in
					fluid intake, the total volume of fluid within the body remains the
					relatively constant. The body’s fluid homeostasis is achieved largely due to the kidneys'
					ability to regulate how much water is excreted in urine. If a person with healthy
					kidneys drinks a large volume of fluids, the kidneys will produce a large volume
					of urine. When a person with healthy kidneys does not drink enough fluids or
					experiences significant fluid loss, the kidneys will produce a small amount of
					concentrated urine to conserve water.</p>


				<p>Urine is composed of urea, chloride, sodium, potassium, creatinine and other
					compounds (ions, inorganic and organic). Urea is an organic breakdown product of
					nitrogenous materials.</p>
