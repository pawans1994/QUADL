Specific gravity is the ratio of density of a fluid compared to water.</hint><hint>Salt water is more dense than pure water. For example, sea water has a specific gravity of 1.025, which is a density of 1.025 g/mL compared with pure water, which is 1.000 g/mL.</hint></part></question><question id="percentage_water_urine"><body>What amount of urine is water in a normal healthy adult?</body><multiple_choice select="single" shuffle="true"><choice value="A">&gt;95%</choice><choice value="B">80 â€“ 95%</choice><choice value="C">60-80%</choice><choice value="D">20-60%</choice></multiple_choice><part id="percentage_water_urine_p1"><skillref idref="identify_urine_comp_molecular" /><response match="A" score="10"><feedback>Correct.
