            <!--LO:-->
            <body>As noted above, the volume of urine can vary. Using both the above chart and the
                text, why would the volume change? The answer needs to be more complete than simply,
                “drinking more would change the volume”.</body>
            <short_answer id="A"/>

                <response input="A" match="*" score="10"/>
                <explanation>Despite the volume of liquid varying from day to day, the total volume
                    of fluid within the body typically remains the same. This is due to the body’s
                    fluid homeostasis. Through homeostasis, a person will urinate more when drinking
                    a large amount of fluid. Conversely, when an inadequate amount of fluids are not
                    taken in, the kidneys will produce a small amount of concentrated urine to
                    preserve water. So, through homeostasis, the amount of fluid in the body will
                    remain about the same.</explanation>
