            <!--LO:-->
            <body>With considering the role of the medullary interstitial, what is the difference
                between countercurrent exchange and countercurrent multiplication?</body>
            <short_answer id="A"/>
            <part>
                <response input="A" match="*" score="10"/>
                <explanation>In countercurrent exchange, urea and sodium and chloride ions diffuse
                    from the medullary interstitial fluid into the blood, which then allows water to
                    diffuse from the blood into the interstitial fluid. The countercurrent
                    multiplication mechanism, located in the loop of Henle, is responsible for the
                    establishment of an osmotic gradient within the medullary
                    interstitium.</explanation>
