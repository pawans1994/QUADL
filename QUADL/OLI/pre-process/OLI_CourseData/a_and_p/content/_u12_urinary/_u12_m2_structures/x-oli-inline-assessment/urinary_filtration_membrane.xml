What is the maximum size of nanomaterials that are cleared by the kidney?</body><multiple_choice select="single" shuffle="true"><choice value="A">0.5 nanometers</choice><choice value="B">5 nanometers</choice><choice value="C">50 nanometers</choice><choice value="D">500 nanometers</choice></multiple_choice><part id="nanomaterials_p1"><skillref idref="recognize_filtration_membrane_capacity_nanometers" /><response match="A" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Materials this small will be eliminated by the kidney, but this is not the maximum size; for scale, 0.5 nanometers is only about 5 atoms large.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. Nanomaterials such as liposomes and gadolinium for MRI imaging pass through the kidneys.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Nanomaterials of this size will be cleared by other parts of the body; these nanomaterials are too large to pass through the glomerulus.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. These nanomaterials are too large to pass through the glomerulus and they will stay on the blood side.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
