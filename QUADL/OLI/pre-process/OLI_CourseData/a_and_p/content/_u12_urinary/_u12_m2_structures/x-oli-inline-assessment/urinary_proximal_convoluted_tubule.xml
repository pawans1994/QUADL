Reabsorption returns about 99 percent of filtered water and many filtered solutes to the bloodstream and cells in the proximal convoluted tubule perform most reabsorption, In addition, reabsorption starts as soon as filtrate enters the proximal convoluted tubules.</feedback></response><response match="B" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Overall, to maintain normal plasma levels, almost every organic is completely reabsorbed by the cells in the proximal convoluted tubule, epithelial cells along the length of the renal tubule, and the collecting duct.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Overall, to maintain normal plasma levels, almost every organic is completely reabsorbed by the cells in the proximal convoluted tubule, epithelial cells along the length of the renal tubule, and the collecting duct.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The amount of water and number of ions reabsorbed is determined by hormonal signals and is based on homeostatic needs. The proximal convoluted tubule does not make this interpretation.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
