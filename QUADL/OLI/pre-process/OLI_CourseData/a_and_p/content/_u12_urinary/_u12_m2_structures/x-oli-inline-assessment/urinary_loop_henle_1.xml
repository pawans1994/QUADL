The GFR and flow through the proximal convoluted tubule establishes the flow rate through the nephron loop. </feedback></response><response match="B" score="10"><feedback>Correct. The reabsorption of water from the descending limb increases the osmolarity of the filtrate. The secretion of solutes from the ascending limb decreases the osmolarity of the filtrate.</feedback></response><response match="C" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. Water is reabsorbed in the decending limb, but the ascending limb is impermeable to water and solutes are reabsorbed here.</feedback></response><response match="D" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The action of the ascending limb helps create a gradient for water reabsorption from the descending limb to occur. </feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
