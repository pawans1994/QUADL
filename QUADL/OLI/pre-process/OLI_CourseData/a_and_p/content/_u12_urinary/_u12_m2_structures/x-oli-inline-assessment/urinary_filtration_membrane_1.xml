            <body>Doctors will look for the serum proteins in the urine as a test for kidney damage.
                Why?</body>

                <explanation>If serum proteins are filtered through the gomerulus that means that the
                    filtration membrane may be damaged. Normally proteins are blocked by
                    size.</explanation>
