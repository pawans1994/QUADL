                <explanation>The Urinary system utilizes the process of excretion to rid the body of
                    the nitrogenous waste products of metabolism. It will also rid the body of some
                    unmetabolized drugs through the process of elimination. The digestive system
                    utilizes elimination to rid the body of undigestable materials. </explanation>
