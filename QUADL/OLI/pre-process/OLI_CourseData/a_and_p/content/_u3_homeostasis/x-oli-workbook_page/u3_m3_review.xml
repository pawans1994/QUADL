However, the organ systems also work together to help the body maintain homeostasis. For example, the cardiovascular, urinary, and lymphatic systems all help the body control water balance. Similarly, the cardiovascular, integumentary, respiratory, and muscular systems work together to help the body maintain a stable internal temperature.</p><p id="cf2f1be30c374794b22332ccf937b16e">Proper calcium levels are important to maintain whole body homeostasis. Calcium ions are used for the heartbeat, the contraction of muscles, the activation of enzymes, and cellular communication. The parathyroid and thyroid glands of the endocrine system detect changes in blood calcium levels and function to restore homeostasis. Similarly, the endocrine functions of the pancreas and liver, along with the nervous and digestive systems, coordinate efforts to maintain normal blood glucose levels.</p><activity idref="_u3_homeostasis_integration_quiz" purpose="quiz" /></body></workbook_page>
