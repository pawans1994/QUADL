        <title>Homeostatic Maintenance Review and Assessment </title>
    </head>

    <body>

        <p>As you studied these different examples, you should recognize that homeostasis is
            occurring at all the levels of organization: chemical, cell, tissue, organ and organ
            system. Maintaining homeostasis within the body is important for proper physiological
            function, growth and remodeling. You will be studying homeostasis in the various Modules
            for each of the different body systems. Negative feedback mechanisms are especially
            important, with problems in any component of the feedback loop resulting in the
            consequences we can associate with homeostasis dysfunction. </p>
