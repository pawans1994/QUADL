                <explanation>Although there are many correct answers, one example would be that chemical reactions that regulate the amount of ATP within the cell. Certain enzymes in the enzymatic pathway for making ATP will be inhibited when ATP levels are high (called feedback inhibition), while these same enzymes will not be inhibited when ATP is low. Exercise stimulates a use in ATP and a de-inhibition of these enzymes in order to maintain ATP levels within the cell.</explanation>
