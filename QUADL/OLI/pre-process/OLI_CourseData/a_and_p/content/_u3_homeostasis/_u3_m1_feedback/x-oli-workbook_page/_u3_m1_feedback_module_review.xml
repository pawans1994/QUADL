It is defined as the tendency of biological systems to maintain relatively constant conditions in the internal environment while continuously interacting with and adjusting to changes originating within or outside the system.</p><p id="bb3db34664484a23b8d359d7f0af093b">Maintenance of homeostasis requires feedback loops that control the bodyâ€™s internal conditions. Feedback loops respond to keep systems functioning near a set point, or ideal level. In positive feedback loops, a change in a given direction causes additional change in the same direction. Conversely, in negative feedback loops, a change in a given direction causes change in the opposite direction. Make sure you understand the terminology used to in feedback loops, and be able to provide examples of both positive and negative feedback loops</p><activity idref="_u3_homeostasis_feedback_quiz" purpose="quiz" /></body></workbook_page>
