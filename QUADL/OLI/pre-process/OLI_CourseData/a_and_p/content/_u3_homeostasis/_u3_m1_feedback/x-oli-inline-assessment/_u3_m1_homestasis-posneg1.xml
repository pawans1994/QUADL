When you exercise, your muscles need more oxygen. Therefore, to maintain an adequate oxygen level in all of the tissues in your body, you increase respiration rate and depth. This allows you to take in more oxygen. Your heart rate increases, which allows it to deliver more oxygenated blood to your muscles and other organs that will need more oxygen.</p></content><question id="posneg"><body>Is this an example of a positive or negative feedback loop?</body><multiple_choice shuffle="false"><choice value="pos">positive</choice><choice value="neg">negative</choice></multiple_choice><part id="posneg_p1"><skillref idref="_u3_compare_pos_neg_SKILL" /><response match="pos" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. If this were a positive loop, the decrease in blood oxygen would stimulate the body to continue to decrease blood oxygen. Instead, the body counteracts this decrease with processes to increase it back to normal levels.</feedback></response><response match="neg" score="1"><feedback>Correct. The decrease in blood oxygen when you exercise stimulates your body to raise your blood oxygen level to its normal set point.</feedback></response><hint>Remember, a positive feedback loop will continue the process in its original direction. A negative feedback loop will work to counteract the stimulus to maintain a set point.</hint></part></question></page></assessment>
