<title>Compare Positive and Negative Feedback Loops</title>

      <question id="posneg2">
            <body>Why is the process described in the above activity a negative feedback loop? Explain using the terms stimulus and set point.</body>
            <short_answer id="posneg2"/>

                  <response input="posneg2" match="*" score="1"></response>
                  <explanation>This is an example of a negative feedback loop because the body is
                              maintaining a set level of oxygen in the bloodstream. As the muscles
                              use the available blood oxygen (stimulus), the body works to replace
                              this oxygen by breathing in more oxygen (increased intake) and
                              transporting it more quickly throughout the entire body (quickened
                              heartbeat). This system is inherently stable because when you modify
                              your exercise, your body modifies its responses to maintain a set
                              level of oxygen available to all tissues in the body. </explanation>
