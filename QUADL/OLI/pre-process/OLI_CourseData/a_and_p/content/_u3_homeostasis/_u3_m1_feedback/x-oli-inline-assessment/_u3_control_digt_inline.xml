The baroreceptors measure a variable, they do not decide if the variable is at an appropriate value.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.

Blood pressure is the variable being monitored and controlled.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The receptors detect the blood pressure change, even though some are located in the hypothalamus.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="1"><feedback>Correct. Both of these parts of the brainstem will determine the changes that are needed to compensate for the change in blood volume to maintain blood pressure homeostasis.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect.

Increased heart rate and constricted blood vessels will compensate for decreased blood volume by increasing blood pressure.</feedback></response><response match="b" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The heart rate and blood vessel diameter can’t change the blood volume; the kidney would have to be an effector in a different feedback loop to change the blood volume.</feedback></response><response match="c" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. A decrease in blood pressure would not correct for the blood volume drop, since blood pressure has also fallen.</feedback></response><response match="d" score="0"><feedback>Incorrect. The heart rate and blood vessel diameter can’t change the blood volume; the kidney would have to be an effector in a different feedback loop to change the blood volume.</feedback></response></part></question></page></assessment>
