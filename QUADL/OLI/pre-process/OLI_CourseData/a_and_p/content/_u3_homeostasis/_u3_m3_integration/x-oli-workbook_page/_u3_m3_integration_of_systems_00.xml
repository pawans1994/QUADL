        <p>Within the body, many systems are integrated to help maintain the homeostasis of the entire 
            organism. For example, calcium helps maintain the function of the heart as well as other organ 
            systems. Calcium is regulated by the endocrine system and is stored in the bones of the 
            skeletal system. </p>
