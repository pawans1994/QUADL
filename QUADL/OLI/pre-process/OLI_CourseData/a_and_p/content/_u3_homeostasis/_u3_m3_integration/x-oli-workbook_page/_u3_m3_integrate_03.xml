        <p>The endocrine functions of the pancreas and liver coordinate efforts to maintain normal
            blood glucose levels. When pancreatic cells detect low blood glucose levels, the
            pancreas synthesizes and secretes the hormone glucagon. Glucagon causes the liver to
            convert the polymerized sugar glycogen into glucose through a process known as
            glycogenolysis. Glucose then travels through the blood to allow all cells of the body to
            use it. </p>
        <p>If pancreatic cells detect high blood glucose levels, the pancreas synthesizes and
            releases the hormone insulin. Insulin causes polymerization of glucose into glycogen,
            which is then stored in the liver through a process known as glycogenesis.</p>
        <p>The nervous and digestive systems also play a role in maintaining blood glucose levels.
            When the stomach is empty and blood glucose levels are low, the digestive system and the
            brain respond by making you feel hungryâ€”your stomach may "growl," and you may feel pain
            or discomfort in your midsection. These sensations prompt you to eat, which raises blood
            glucose levels. </p>
