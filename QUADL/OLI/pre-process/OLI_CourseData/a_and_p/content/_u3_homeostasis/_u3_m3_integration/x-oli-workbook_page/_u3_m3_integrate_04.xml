        <p>All organ systems require a balance of cell division and apoptosis during development, growth, 
            and repair to maintain tissue structure and function. The endocrine and immune systems are 
            important regulators for cell populations. The endocrine system delivers steroids and growth 
            hormones that send survival signals to specific tissues so that apoptosis is prevented. 
            Additionally, the endocrine system delivers some hormones that work to induce apoptosis under 
            some physiological conditions.</p>
        <p>The cells of the immune system screen the blood for cells that divide at inappropriate times. 
            Immune cells produce antibodies to mark these out-of-control cells for destruction. A breakdown in 
            these processes can lead to the formation of tumors.</p>
