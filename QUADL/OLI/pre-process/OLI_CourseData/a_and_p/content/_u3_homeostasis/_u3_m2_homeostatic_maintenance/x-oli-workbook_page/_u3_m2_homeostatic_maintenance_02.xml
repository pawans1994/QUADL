        <p>Glucose is an important energy source used by most cells in the body, especially muscles.
            Without glucose, the body "starves", but if there is too much glucose, problems occur in
            the kidneys, eyes, and even with the immune response. Insulin is a hormone produced by the
            pancreas in response to increased blood glucose levels. When the pancreas releases
            insulin, it acts as a key to open  passageways for glucose to enter all body cells, where it is used for energy production. The liver also plays an important role in this feedback loop. Excess glucose is used by liver and muscle cells to synthesize
            glycogen for storage. The pancreas also produces the hormone glucagon. Glucagon is
            released when blood glucose levels decrease and stimulates liver cells to catabolize glycogen back to glucose,
            which is then released into the blood to bring blood glucose levels back up. </p>
