Internal and nuclear signals allow a cell to regulate its cell division/replication cycle.</feedback></response><response match="pro_apop"><feedback>Incorrect. Proliferation (an increase in cell number) and apoptosis (decrease in cell number) are not the variable.</feedback></response><response match="tissues"><feedback>Incorrect.

The cell to cell connections would best be considered a method of communication.</feedback></response><response match="signal"><feedback>Incorrect. This is probably not the best answer here, as this might best be considered a method of communication. </feedback></response><response match="pro_apop"><feedback>Incorrect.

Internal chemical and genetic signals determine the metabolic response, but this is not the best answer. </feedback></response><response match="pro_apop"><feedback>Incorrect. The control center is where the change is processed; proliferation or apoptosis are the effects of the change.</feedback></response><response match="tissues" score="1"><feedback>Correct.
