    <body>
       
        
        <p>You have read about general and specific examples of homeostasis, including positive and
            negative feedback, and have learned the terminology that is used to describe parts
            of the feedback loops. It is important to become comfortable with the terminology since
            it will be used to introduce new concepts in upcoming sections of this course.</p>
        
        <p>Maintaining homeostasis within the body is important for proper physiological function. It is important to recognize the mechanisms of homeostasis in the
            body, as well as the consequences of homeostasis dysfunction.</p>
        
        <p>In the following examples, you will learn to identify homeostasis at different levels of
            organization, such as how the body maintains tight control over small molecules, and the
            importance of maintaining cell number.</p>
