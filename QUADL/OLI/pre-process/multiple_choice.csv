In the summer of 2010; the Gallup poll found that 60% of nonretirees thought that Social Security would not be able to pay a benefit. Five years later in the summer of 2015; Gallup asked the same question to 1;282 nonretirees and found that 51% of respondents did not think that Social Security would be able to pay a retirement benefit by the time that they retire.We would like to test the hypothesis that in 2015 there is a lower proportion of nonretirees who do not think that Social Security will be able to pay them a benefit.

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a U.S. government agency that regulates (you guessed it) food and drugs for consumer safety. One thing the FDA regulates is the allowable insect parts in various foods. You may be surprised to know that much of the processed food we eat contains insect parts. An example is flour.When wheat is ground into flour; insects that were in the wheat are ground up as well. The mean number of insect parts allowed in 100 grams (about 3 ounces) of wheat flour is 75. If the FDA finds more than this number; they conduct further tests to determine if the flour is too contaminated by insect parts to be fit for human consumption.The FDA takes a random sample of 35 bags of flour for evaluation and finds that they contain an average of 80 insect parts per 100 grams; with a standard deviation of 6.3.

They collect a random sample of students independently from each of the two universities and ask each student how many alcoholic drinks they consumed in the previous week.The official conducts a two-sample t-test to determine whether these data provide significant evidence that students at University 1 drink more than students at University 2. The test statistic is t = 2.64 with a p-value 0.005.Which of the following is an appropriate conclusion?,0: 1: The samples provide significant evidence that students at University 1 drink more than students at University 2. 2: The samples do not provide statistically significant evidence that there is a difference in drinking habits at the two universities. 3: We cannot use the t-test in this case because the variables (number of drinks) are likely skewed to the right at each university.,The samples provide significant evidence that students at University 1 drink more than students at University 2.

The policy of the center was to change the diapers on a schedule every three hours. The director wanted to find out if adjusting the diaper-changing schedule to every two hours would significantly reduce the number of diaper rashes. Since some of the infants seemed to have more sensitive skin; she decided to directly compare the number of diaper rashes for each individual infant when the diaper was changed every three hours versus every two hours. For the first week; the daycare center changed the diapers as usual every three hours and noted the number of days that each infant had symptoms of a diaper rash. During the second week; the teachers changed diapers every two hours and recorded the number of days with symptoms of a diaper rash.

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,A medical school admissions officer was interested in whether there is a difference in MCAT test scores (the standardized test used for medical school admission) between (1) biological sciences majors; (2) social science majors and (3) math majors. The admissions officer randomly sampled 50 students from each of these majors who applied to medical school in 2014 and recorded their MCAT score.Here are the three sample standard deviations for the MCAT scores for the three groups (biological sciences majors; social sciences majors; math majors): ColumnStd. Head Biological Sciences5.3115216 Social Sciences6.1661669 Math4.7821787Based on this information; do the data meet the condition of equal population standard deviations for the use of the ANOVA?,0: 1: Yes; because 6.17 − 4.78 < 2. 2: Yes; because 6.17/4.78 < 2. 3: No; because the standard deviations are not equal.,Yes; because 6.17/4.78 < 2.,
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,To determine the relative effectiveness of different study strategies for the SAT; suppose three groups of students are randomly selected: One group took the SAT without any prior studying; the second group took the SAT after studying on their own from a common study booklet available in the bookstore; and the third group took the SAT after completing a paid summer study session from a private test-prep company.The means and standard deviations of the resulting SAT scores from this hypothetical study are summarized below: One of the conditions that allows us to use ANOVA safely is that of equal (population) standard deviations. Can we assume that this condition is met in this case?,0: 1: No; since the three sample standard deviations are not all equal. 2: No; since the population standard deviations are not given; so we cannot check this condition. 3: Yes; since 5.7 − 4.9 < 2. 4: Yes; since 5.7/4.9 < 2.,Yes; since 5.7/4.9 < 2.,
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Using four methods to teach ANOVA; do these four samples differ enough from each other to reject the null hypothesis that type of instruction has no effect on mean test performance? Method to teach ANOVAMeanSDN method 1 (single teacher)4.850.36034 method 2 (co-teachers)4.610.71531 method 3 (computer)4.610.68836 method 4 (lab)4.380.79332Since we are comparing more than 2 groups; we will use ANOVA to test whether the data provide evidence that test score is related to teaching method.One of the conditions that allows us to use ANOVA safely is that of equal (population) standard deviations. Can we assume that this condition is met in this case?,0: 1: Yes; since 0.793 − 0.360 < 2. 2: No; since 0.793/0.360 > 2 3: No; since the four sample standard deviations are not all equal. 4: No; since the population standard deviations are not given; so we cannot check this condition.,No; since 0.793/0.360 > 2,
