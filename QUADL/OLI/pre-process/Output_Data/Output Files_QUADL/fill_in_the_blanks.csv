The increased temperature may actually impair the replication of infecting bacteria and viruses that are adapted to survive best at your normal body temperature. Thus fever can give your immune cells a chance to destroy the microorganisms before they can rapidly multiply and spread in the body. There is also some indirect evidence that increased body temperature slightly modifies several metabolic reactions in ways that also allow the immune system to function more efficiently.Once the new higher set point is reached, the temperature receptors (thermoreceptors) send information to the _________(i1). In response, the _________(i2) (effectors) are stimulated to _________(i3). Unfortunately during some infections, pyrogen levels come in ""waves"". This adjusts your temperature set point up and down. When pyrogen levels dip, you get the other part of the fever experience: “the sweats” and feeling flushed. As long as the pyrogen levels continue to increase and decrease you will feel like you are swinging back and forth. Once the pyrogen level is reduced because the infection is under control, the set point within the _________(i4) will reset back to normal.
