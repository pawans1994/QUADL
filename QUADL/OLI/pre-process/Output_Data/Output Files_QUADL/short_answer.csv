You could create blank classification charts, similar to the ones in the unit, and see if you can fill them in with your own words after you have studied. You could also create flashcards for terms in bold in unit or in your textbook, to help learn descriptions and definitions. Labeling and coloring activities, typically found in lab manuals, can also be useful in learning the organ system structures. Creating a flow chart that puts structures or events in sequence will help with some processes that occur in steps. See the next section on Learning Strategies for more ideas."
_u0_overview_metacog,x-oli-inline-assessment,/Users/pawan/Documents/Project/a_and_p/content//_u0_overview_metacog/x-oli-inline-assessment/_u1_lo_sc.xml,Describe some study techniques that would be best suited to learning objectives at the reasoning level.,This requires you apply what you have learned about the system. You can create a mind-map that shows relationships among different parts and processes. Completing a Venn diagram is a good way to compare and contrast two or three related structures or functions and organizational tables help you analyze multiple characteristics. Watching animated videos of a physiological process and then creating your own outline or drawing of the process can help you learn the important events and how they interact. Reading case studies can help you predict and evaluate the effects on organ systems. See the next section on Learning Strategies for more ideas.

What is changing to make this tissue more sensitive to oxytocin and enhance this positive feedback?,The steroid estrogen hormone is stimulating the transcription of protein receptors for oxytocin that are inserted into the smooth muscle cell membrane. Oxytocin binds to its receptor to stimulate stronger and longer contractions for birth.None

This helps expel the placenta, also known as the afterbirth. Why would the contractions continue for this time period even though the baby has been born?","Hormones produced before the end of stretch receptors being stimulated are still circulating in the blood and will continue to stimulate the uterine smooth muscle with receptors for oxytocin until the hormone is bound or degraded slowly. Unlike the nervous system which initiates and ends stimulation quickly, the endocrine system is not only slower to initiate, but also slower to end its effect.None"

What would be the advantage of input from other parts of the brain continuing to stimulate the hypothalamus, and thus more thyroid hormone production even if the blood level has returned within normal homeostatic range?","Temporarily increased levels of thyroid releasing and stimulating hormone would result in elevated thyroid hormone levels above the homeostatic range. This would allow the body to generate metabolic heat in an emergency situation, improving cold-tolerance along with other homeostatic body temperature regulating mechanisms. This response is most noticeable in young children.None"

Without this, it would take much longer for the hypothalamus to stop stimulating the anterior pituitary and then the anterior pituitary to stop stimulating the thyroid and the level of circulating thyroid hormone would fluctuate more and potentially increase above the homeostatic range. This situation, however, also makes it hard to artificially mimic the homeostatic maintenance of blood thyroid hormone levels with drug replacements. It often takes weeks or months of adjusting drug doses to treat hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism with drugs.None"
_u10_endocrine,_u10_m1_LOO,/Users/pawan/Documents/Project/a_and_p/content//_u10_endocrine/_u10_m1_LOO/x-oli-inline-assessment/endo_LOO_stimuli_lbd.xml,Homeostatic mechanisms stimulated by changes in body fluid composition (humoral) often involve more than one hormone in a negative feedback loop. Why would this be typical? For example: insulin decreases blood glucose while glucagon increases blood glucose; parathyroid hormone increases blood calcium levels while calcitonin from thyroid decreases blood calcium in children.,"Stimulating opposite responses to maintain body fluid homeostasis will need to involve different target cells and metabolic responses. Because each hormone has a specific receptor and specific effect on its target cells, it will take different hormones to maintain this humoral component within homeostatic range. As it increases, it would stimulate release of one hormone but not the other; as it decreases, it would stimulate release of the other hormone.None"

_u10_endocrine,_u10_m1_LOO,/Users/pawan/Documents/Project/a_and_p/content//_u10_endocrine/_u10_m1_LOO/x-oli-inline-assessment/endo_pancreas_tt_digt.xml,What would be the stimulus and effect if both alpha and beta cells were secreting their hormone?,"F or PP cells can stimulate both insulin and glucagon release after a high protein meal or fasting. In the case of protein, glucagon will stimulate the conversion of excess protein into glucose and insulin will lower the resulting increase in blood glucose. In the case of fasting, both are needed to ensure glucose is made available, despite the lack of food intake. Just as with a high protein diet, both hormones contribute to sustaining the cells."

Resorption refers to remodeling by lysis; the osteoclasts are dissolving the calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) bone matrix to release minerals into the blood, thereby remodeling the bone structure. Absorption refers to bringing into the body from outside, so calcium is absorbed from food into the intestinal cells and then into blood for transport through body.None"

This excess calcium in the nephron tubules and kidney tubes can crystalize to form one of the common kidney stones that block tubes, damage tissue and cause pain.None"

PTH would inhibit osteoblasts so they don’t remove the blood calcium being conserved by the kidney and absorbed by the intestine."

What is the functional significance of this anatomical feature?,"Through the major homeostasis centers and “master gland” with tropic hormones, melatonin can influence many different targets in the body. Normally this sets up a circadian rhythm of metabolism, but it also accounts for the wide range of effects associated with jet lag or shift work.None"

Why?","The soils in that region have some of the lowest iodine levels in the world and they were eating mostly fresh water fish which did not provide iodine in their diet. Coastal regions with access to seafood did not have the same problems. Today with wide distribution of refrigerated fresh and frozen seafood, that is less a concern."

Many even know of the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, most people don’t know much about this very different disease called diabetes insipidus. The term “diabetes” is derived from Greek meaning “through a siphon”. How would you explain to them why they are both called diabetes?","Both diseases involve excess urine production (polyuria) and excess thirst (polydipsia). In diabetes insipidus, the lack of the hormone that normally controls water reabsorption by osmosis is missing, so this is a direct link to increased urine production. In diabetes mellitus, the hormone involved is insulin that normally controls movement of glucose from the blood into cells for metabolism. The resulting increased blood glucose results in more glucose being filtered than can be reabsorbed. This extra solute draws more water into the tubules by osmosis, increasing urine volume. As the condition becomes chronic, destruction of the kidney itself increases this effect by presence of protein in the filtrate and urine as well.None"

It can also lead to lower enzyme function which can decrease the ability of the body to convert between carbon dioxide and carbonic acid. Breathing in through the nose is advantageous because the nasal cavity contains the nasal conchae which help to warm and humidify the cold air before it enters the trachea. The nostrils are also smaller in diameter so less air can enter and be warmed at one time.
_u11_respiratory,_u11_m4_homeostasis,/Users/pawan/Documents/Project/a_and_p/content//_u11_respiratory/_u11_m4_homeostasis/x-oli-inline-assessment/respiratory_system_homeostasis.xml,A common treatment for hyperventilation has been to breath into a paper bag. Based on what you know about how the respiratory system functions to maintain homeostasis. Explain why this may help hyperventilation but may also cause serious problems.,"By breathing out into a paper bag a person creates air that is rich in carbon dioxide. Hyperventilation lowers the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood by inhaling air that is rich in carbon dioxide a person can restore some of that carbon dioxide. If the carbon dioxide levels in the blood fall too far it can result in hypocapnia which can result in the dilation of blood vessels and an increased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. These two things can cause a lack of oxygen being supplied to the brain. The other issue can occur when a person is breathing the air from the bag, they are breathing air with a lower concentration of oxygen which lowers the amount of oxygen available to the person.

If water conservation is required, the Antidiuretic hormone allows the kidneys to produce a small amount of concentrated urine to both preserve water and still eliminate wastes and surplus ions."

The countercurrent multiplication mechanism, located in the loop of Henle, is responsible for the establishment of an osmotic gradient within the medullary interstitium."

Why?,If serum proteins are filtered through the gomerulus that means that the filtration membrane may be damaged. Normally proteins are blocked by size.

Using both the above chart and the text, why would the volume change? The answer needs to be more complete than simply, “drinking more would change the volume”.","Despite the volume of liquid varying from day to day, the total volume of fluid within the body typically remains the same. This is due to the body’s fluid homeostasis. Through homeostasis, a person will urinate more when drinking a large amount of fluid. Conversely, when an inadequate amount of fluids are not taken in, the kidneys will produce a small amount of concentrated urine to preserve water. So, through homeostasis, the amount of fluid in the body will remain about the same."

Entry through a cut in the skin allows for such access. When it enters, the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) found on the surface of the bacteria are recognized by the local immune cells. Mast cells begin to release chemicals to recruit other immune cells, then macrophages or neutrophils will phagocytize the bacteria and lyse it. The area of infection shows signs of infection. It will become hot, red, swollen, and become painful because of the influx of inflammatory cells.None"

Signs of infection and inflammation are evident within minutes of exposure. The innate immune response will either prevent or diminish the potential damage that can result if a pathogen gained access to the body.None

What two body fluids are necessary in order for us to smell and taste? _________(chemoreceptor_sa),"The saliva dissolves chemicals in food so we can taste them and mucous of our nasal cavity dissolves airborne chemicals so we can smell them. If you dry off your tongue and hold your nose, you won’t be able to “taste” the difference between a piece of apple or a piece of potato. Much of what we perceive as “taste” is really smell – think about how things “taste” when you have congestion from a bad cold and can’t smell."
_u14_nervous,x-oli-inline-assessment,/Users/pawan/Documents/Project/a_and_p/content//_u14_nervous/x-oli-inline-assessment/define_epsp_sc.xml,"The channels responsible for EPSP’s are sodium channels, while those responsible for IPSP’s are potassium and chloride channels. Can you explain why?","Due to the higher extracellular concentration of Na+, opening Na+-channels causes rapid inward diffusion of Na+ that leads to depolarization (less negative or positive on inside) of the cell membrane. On the other hand, opening of K+-channel or the Cl—channel causes these ions to follow the concentration gradient out of the cell (K+) or into the cell (Cl-), respectively, leading to hyperpolarization (even more negative than resting potential on inside)."
_u14_nervous,x-oli-inline-assessment,/Users/pawan/Documents/Project/a_and_p/content//_u14_nervous/x-oli-inline-assessment/define_hyperalgesia_LBD1.xml,"The term hyperalgesia comes from the Greek roots “hyper-” meaning “over” and “-algos” meaning “pain”. The increased pain perception comes from sensitization of the normally silent mechanoreceptors. Another term, allodynia comes from the Greek roots “allos” meaning “other” and “odune” also meaning “pain”. The change in this instance occurs within the central nervous system neurochemistry, not in the peripheral receptors. An example of this “other pain” is when it hurts to have your shirt touch your skin after a sunburn. What is the main difference between hyperalgesia and allodynia? _________(q1_sa)","Allodynia is used to describe pain from a stimulus that normally would not be able to stimulate pain receptors, such as light touch stimulating pain receptors near the epidermis/dermis border. The changes occur within the central nervous system, not the receptor. Hyperalgesia is used to describe the increased sensation of pain from a stimulus that would normally stimulate only pressure receptors if the silent pain receptors themselves in the peripheral nervous system were not sensitized. The change occurs with the receptors in the peripheral nervous system."

The scalp is numbed and the patient receives some sedation, but does not lose consciousness. The patient may be asked questions and respond during the surgery. Based on your knowledge of nociceptor distribution, explain how this is possible._________(q1_sa)","The brain and spinal cord tissue does not contain nociceptors. So a headache is not pain coming from the brain itself. The pain is coming from stimulation of nociceptors associated with other tissues around the nervous tissue of the brain, such as meninges or blood vessels, or from other structures in the head, such as muscles, sinuses, or eyes."

What evidence do you have that this was not a somatic reflex?_________(qsub_0)","Because they didn’t actually touch the pan, there was no sensory input to initiate the involuntary reflex to stimulate the motor response of quickly withdrawing their hand. Instead, they initiated a voluntary motor response that prevented stimulation of that receptor based on other sensory input being consciously interpreted and linked to conscious learned behavior or memory."

What would be their purpose? _________(qpart_0),"Many medicines contain alkaloids that are bitter, so this acts as a bitter block and makes the medicine taste less bitter, so patients would be more likely to take their medication as prescribed. This negates the need to add sweet chemicals to make it a little more palatable. Future research on the proposed fat receptor could include identifying chemical blocking strategies to reduce the taste attraction to fat as a method to help manage obesity in some people."

What is different in how these channels behave that creates the different types of potentials?,"Graded potentials will open or close Na+ and K+ channels in response to various stimuli but when they do they create only small localized change in membrane potential. For an action potential, a voltage-gated Na+ channel opens in response to voltage change and causes a standardized large and quick change in membrane potential and K+ channels open slower while Na+ channels close.

These secretions normally flow down the lacrimal duct as quickly as they are produced. When we cry, we are producing tears faster than they can enter the duct, so they back up and leak out of the medial corner where the duct opening is found. This also accounts for the runny nose that often occurs with crying, since more tears than normal are still entering the nasal cavity through the lacrimal ducts."

When we are faced with such a situation, it is unlikely that we will have time to eat (or even feel like eating), nor will we have the time to waste on going to the bathroom; hence these functions will not be facilitated. Since the blood flow has to increase to other more important organs, peripheral arteries (integumentary) will be constricted to limit blood-flow towards the body surface. As a result, we also feel cold."

How does the anatomy of the sympathetic nervous system provide for more widespread effects?,"The sympathetic postganglionic fibers travel a long distance to their targets. This allows the fibers to branch so that multiple target organs can be innervated by a single fiber. In the parasympathetic nervous system, the ganglia occur near or within the target so there is very little divergence and a single fiber stimulates a single target. Also, the adrenal medulla releases catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) to the bloodstream where they can travel throughout the body and exert an effect on any target that has a receptor. The parasympathetic nervous system does not have a mechanism to release its neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, into the bloodstream."

Why would this defect often cause trouble eating, frequent middle ear infections, and, if not corrected as a child, affect speech?","Because of the gap in the hard palate, there is a connection between the nasal cavity and mouth. Swallowed milk can pass out the nasal cavity, rather than down the oropharynx, laryngopharynx and esophagus. Air can enter the nasal cavity from the mouth, resonating and creating a nasal sound when trying to speak. The Eustachian tube from the middle ear opening in the nasopharynx would not normally be exposed to food and liquid swallowed, but with cleft palate this is more likely to happen."

The gall bladder stores that bile in-between meals, with hormones controlling the timing of its release into the small intestine. The pancreas is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system and hormones to produce pancreatic juice only as stimulated by steps in the digestive process.
