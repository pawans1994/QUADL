_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"If you had to choose one college among the six colleges based on this data, which college would it be? Explain your reasoning.","If I had to choose one college based on the graduation rates, I would choose college D. Not only does this college have the largest median graduation rates, but it also has the smallest variation in graduation rates over the years. This means that even in years when college D has a relatively small graduation rate, it is not MUCH smaller than the median (min = 74.1%, Median = 79%), and is still higher than most graduation rates at the other colleges. In particular, the smallest graduation rate that occurred in college D (74.1%), is still higher than:• the highest graduation rate at colleges A and E,• the third quartile of the distribution of graduation rates at colleges B and C, and• the median graduation rate at college F."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"If you were debating between colleges B and F only, which one would you choose based on this data? Explain your reasoning.","While Colleges B and F have about the same median graduation rate (B: 70.15%, F: 72%), there is a big difference in the variation. College F has a very large variation, and therefore a much less consistent gradation rate over the years (it can get as low as 57.7%). College B, on the other hand, has a much more consistent graduation rate (small variability), and in that sense, college B is less ""risky."" Since I am not a ""risk taker,"" and since both colleges have approximately the same median graduation rate, my choice between the two would be college B."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Explain why you cannot calculate the mean (average) reading level of patients given the above data.,"In order to find the mean, we need the actual values of ALL the observations. Since not all the reading levels can be determined exactly, we have 23 observations (6 below level 3, and 17 above level 12) for which we do not know the actual values."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Find the median readability level of the pamphlets.,"The median readability level of the cancer pamphlets is M = 9. We have 30 readability level data points, and therefore the median will be the mean of the observations located at the (30 / 2) = 15th and (30 / 2) + 1 = 16th spots in the ordered list. Taking the counts into consideration, we find that both the 15th and 16th ranked observations are 9, and therefore the median is (9 + 9) / 2 = 9."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Can you conclude that the pamphlets are well matched to the patients' reading levels? Look carefully at the data.,"Even though the medians of the reading and readability levels are the same, the pamphlets are not well matched to patients' reading levels. Note that the pamphlets' readability level starts at grade level 6, while there are 17 (6 + 4 + 4 + 3) cancer patients whose reading level is below that. These 17 cancer patients therefore do not have any pamphlets that they can fully comprehend."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Remove all points by clicking on the trash. Place three observations on the line by clicking below it, two close together near the center of the line, and one somewhat to the right of those two. Pull the single right-most observation out to the right. (Place the cursor on the point, hold down the mouse button, and drag the point.) How does the mean behave? How does the median behave? Make sure you understand why each measure acts as it does.","As we move the single right-most observation out to the right, the mean also moves to the right, while the median stays in its place. By moving the point to the extreme right we are creating an outlier, and outliers affect the mean and not the median. The mean is affected because it's a numerical average of all the values. The median is affected only by the order of the observations (which has not changed)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Now place 5 observations on the line by clicking below it. Add one additional observation without changing the median. Where is your new point?,"For the median to remain as it is, the new point has to be at exactly the same place where the median already is located."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Use the applet to convince yourself that when you add another observation to those already in place from the last exercise (there will now be 7 in total), the median does not change, regardless of where you put the 7th point. Do you understand why this is the case?","When we had six points, our median was the average of the two central points, which were equal in our case. Once we added one more point (now a total of 7 points), the median stays the same, because one of the two central points from the original dataset will now be among the upper half of the points or the lower half, depending on where you put the new point, but the other one remains as the ""center"" observation, i.e., the median."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Assume that the average rating in each of the three classes is 5 (which should be visually reasonably clear from the histograms), and recall the interpretation of the SD as a ""typical"" or ""average"" distance between the data points and their mean. Judging from the table and the histograms, which class would have the largest standard deviation, and which one would have the smallest standard deviation? Explain your reasoning.","In class I, almost all the ratings are 5, which is also the mean. The average distance between the observations and the mean, then, would be very small. In class II most of the observations are far from the mean (at 1 or 9). The average distance between the observations and the mean in this case would be larger. Class III is the case where some of the observations are close to the mean, and some are far, so the average distance between the observations and the mean would be somewhere in between class I and II. This observation would lead me to conclude that the standard deviation would be ranked (from smallest to largest): Class I, Class III, Class II."

This means that most actors receive the best acting Oscar at a relatively younger age (before age 48), and fewer at an older age.Center: The distribution seems to be centered at around 42-43.

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Compare the distribution of nearsightedness between those exposed to lamp light, a night-light, or no light at all. What do the conditional percentages derived from the data suggest about the relationship between early nighttime exposure to light and later myopia? Should parents worry about using night-lights and lamps with young children?","9.9%. Those exposed to a night-light were nearsighted 34.1% of the time, and those exposed to a lamp were nearsighted54.7% of the time. Note that these percentages show that children who slept with a lamp were about 5 times more likely to develop nearsightedness than the children who slept with no light.Based upon this data alone, parents might discontinue using night-lights and lamps with young children, as their use seems to be associated with nearsightedness when the children grow up. However, there is a strong argument against this conclusion, which will be presented in a later lesson."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,Do the data provide evidence that early light exposure causes myopia?,"Association does not imply causation. We cannot conclude that light exposure in early childhood somehow causes myopia in older children.

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,What is a likely lurking variable in this case that could explain this observed relationship? (Hint: This lurking variable affects both the type of light with which a child sleeps and the child's later nearsightedness.),"A lurking variable that can very likely explain the observed relationship in this case is the nearsightedness of the child's parents (one or both). If the parents are nearsighted, then their child is more likely to be nearsighted due to genetic factors. Also, nearsighted parents are more likely to leave more light near their sleeping children to make it easier to care for them at night. Clickhere to see a visual explanation of this."

Interpret your findings in context.,"The correlation is r = 0.663. The relationship is moderately strong and positive. The positive direction of the relationship means that, in general, animals that have a longer lifespan also have longer pregnancies.

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Give the equation for this new line and compare it with the line you found for the whole dataset, commenting on the effect of the outlier.","Once the outlier for the year 1896 is removed, the equation for the least squares regression line is:Time = 872 + (- 0.33 * Year)When the outlier is removed, the line ""drops"" a bit—the intercept is smaller and the slope is not as negative.

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Describe the relationship between the height and weight of the subjects suggested by the data. Consider the pattern of the data—mainly direction and form—and any deviations from this pattern, such as outliers.","The direction of the relationship is positive. In context, this means that individuals who are taller are heavier. The form of the relationship is curvilinear. Weight seems to increase more and more rapidly with height as we consider taller individuals. We might say that the relationship is moderate in strength, because the points suggest, but do not closely follow, a curvilinear form. There do not appear to be any outliers."

(B) Does it look like the weight of females increases with an increase in height as quickly as the weight of males increases with a corresponding increase in height?","We see that the overall form of the relationship can be thought of in terms of two clusters, one for each gender. Points corresponding to the females cluster in the lower left of the scatterplot, which means that females generally have a lower height and weight than males (due to obvious biological differences between males and females). The main difference between males and females is that the weight of females does not appear to increase as quickly with height as the weight of males does."

Business students shouldn't be any different from other students with respect to this variable.• Sex—could easily be biased. We expect fewer women in business than in the social or natural sciences.• Verbal—could easily be biased. Business students' SAT Verbal scores may tend to be lower, since there are likely to be fewer women, and women tend to do better on the verbal portion of the SAT (as the background to this problem suggests).• Age—should be representative.

The percentage of females is 62% in the population and 52% in the sample of business students; apparently biased, in that females are under-represented in business statistics.Step 3. The SAT Verbal score averaged 589 for the population and 575 for the business students; the sample does seem to be biased, due to lower SAT Verbal scores for business students.Step 4. Finally, the median age for the population is 19.7 and our sample of business students had a median age of 19.5 years; apparently the business students may be considered an unbiased sample when it comes to age."

In other words, if we know that A occurred, then we know for certain that B cannot occur (since they are disjoint), which means that P(B) = 0.

Let's rephrase the question in a way that will make it easier to translate to the language of probability. We are given that one sale has been made 10 minutes into the hour. This means that the number of sales that will be made within the hour, X, is at least one. In other words, we are given that X is greater than or equal to 1.

Set up the new probability distribution of X using the updated probabilities, and using N instead of 1,350. (The answer to question 1 will help.) The question now is: What should the value of N (the new premium) be, if we want the mean of X to remain 750?

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"State the appropriate hypotheses, and explain (to someone who has never studied statistics) in plain words (without using the words ""significant"") what is being tested.",NoneThe appropriate hypotheses (for the t-test for the slope) in this case are:Ho: There is no linear relationship between cry count and IQ.Ha: There is a significant linear relationship between cry count and IQ.What we are trying to assess using this test is whether there is evidence that the (weak-to-moderate) linear relationship that was observed between cry count and IQ in the sample we took also exists among infants in the general population.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Verify that the general conditions that allow you to reliably use the test in 1 are met. Comment: Note that not all the information you need is given in the problem description. In particular, no information is given about how the babies were selected for the study, which is important for assessing whether we can assume that the observations are independent. To get this information, click here and read the first couple of pages of the paper that describes the study.","Let's start with the issue of independence: According to the paper, the 38 infants were a sample of infants born at the Long Island Jewish Hospital at the time of the study. Given this information, we can assume that the observations are independent (even though it doesn't explicitly say that the sample was random). The only obvious way that the independence assumption would be violated is if twins (or triplets ...) were included in the study, which we can assume was not the case.Comment: Even though the sample was chosen from a specific hospital (rather than from the ""entire population of infants""), unless the infants who were born in this specific hospital at the time of the study were systematically different from infants in general in some relevant way, it will still be reasonable to attempt to generalize the results to infants in general. As for the other conditions: The relationship seems linear (even though it is moderately weak), the scatterplot does not display any alarming outliers, and the sample size is reasonably large (n = 38)."
