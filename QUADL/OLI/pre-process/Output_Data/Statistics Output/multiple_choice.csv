_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,In a study conducted by Frantzen and colleagues from 2001 through 2004; researchers studied the consumption of ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) with the body mass index (BMI) of 625 low-income minority fourth- to sixth-grade students living in San Antonio; Texas. (Students were randomly selected.) They measured students’ age; ethnicity; height; and weight and students were administered dietary interviews at the beginning of their fourth-grade year and the end of their fifth- and sixth-grade years. They found a “significant inverse relation between the BMI percentile and the frequency of RTEC consumption” and concluded that “children who frequently consumed RTEC had greater intakes of essential nutrients at baseline and significantly lower BMI over a 3-year period.” Is it safe for us to conclude that there is a causal relationship between regular consumption of RTEC and the drop in BMI?

Roughly 19% of those sampled answered "the war in Iraq" (while the rest answered economy/jobs; terrorism; healthcare; etc.). Exactly a year prior to this poll; in June of 2004; it was estimated that roughly 1 out of every 4 U.S. adults believed (at that time) that the war in Iraq was the most important problem facing the country.We would like to test whether the 2005 poll provides significant evidence that the proportion of U.S. adults who believe that the war in Iraq is the most important problem facing the U.S. has decreased since the prior poll.Which of the following are the appropriate hypotheses in this case?,0: 1: H 2: 0 3: a 4: H 5: 0 6: a 7: H 8: 0 9: a 10: H 11: 0 12: a 13: H 14: 0 15: a,H,

One thing the FDA regulates is the allowable insect parts in various foods. You may be surprised to know that much of the processed food we eat contains insect parts. An example is flour.When wheat is ground into flour; insects that were in the wheat are ground up as well. The mean number of insect parts allowed in 100 grams (about 3 ounces) of wheat flour is 75. If the FDA finds more than this number; they conduct further tests to determine if the flour is too contaminated by insect parts to be fit for human consumption.The FDA takes a random sample of 35 bags of flour for evaluation and finds that they contain an average of 80 insect parts per 100 grams; with a standard deviation of 6.3.

The difference in the two sample mean birth weights (nonsmokers minus smokers) is 281.7 grams and the 95% confidence interval is (76.5; 486.9)Which gives the best interpretation of what we can conclude about the impact of smoking on birth weight?,0: 1: We are 95% confident that on average; smoking causes lower birth weights of between 76.5 grams to 486.9 grams. 2: There is a 95% chance that if a woman smokes during pregnancy her baby will weigh between 76.5 grams to 486.9 grams less than if she did not smoke. 3: When smokers are compared to nonsmokers; we are 95% confident that the mean weight of babies of nonsmokers is between 76.5 grams to 486.9 grams more than the mean weight of babies of smokers. 4: This study does not suggest that there is a difference in mean birth weights when we compare smokers to nonsmokers.,When smokers are compared to nonsmokers; we are 95% confident that the mean weight of babies of nonsmokers is between 76.5 grams to 486.9 grams more than the mean weight of babies of smokers.,
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Breastfeeding burns up to 500 calories per day; so does that mean that women who breastfeed their infants will lose more weight than women who formula feed their infants? A group of researchers studied the amount of weight lost after giving birth by mothers who breastfed their infants and mothers who chose formula feeding. They randomly chose 29 breastfeeding mothers and 21 formula feeding mothers. The researchers recorded how much weight each group lost at 12 months after childbirth. The amount of weight lost was found to be normally distributed. The difference in the mean amount of weight lost for the two samples (breastfeeding vs. formula feeding) is 2.0 kg and the 95% confidence interval is (1.05; 4.19).Which statement gives the best interpretation of what we can conclude about the impact of breastfeeding on the amount of weight lost after childbirth?,0: 1: We are 95% confident that on average; breastfeeding causes an extra weight loss of 1.05 kg to 4.19 kg. 2: There is a 95% chance that if a woman breastfeeds her baby that she will lose an extra 1.05 kg to 4.19 kg than if she used formula to feed her baby. 3: When breastfeeding mothers are compared to formula feeding mothers; we are 95% confident that the mean amount of weight lost 12 months after childbirth is between 1.05 kg and 4.19kg more than the mean amount of weight lost by formula feeding mothers. 4: This study does not suggest that there is a difference in mean amount of weight lost after childbirth when we compare breastfeeding mothers to formula feeding mothers.,When breastfeeding mothers are compared to formula feeding mothers; we are 95% confident that the mean amount of weight lost 12 months after childbirth is between 1.05 kg and 4.19kg more than the mean amount of weight lost by formula feeding mothers.,

Since some of the infants seemed to have more sensitive skin; she decided to directly compare the number of diaper rashes for each individual infant when the diaper was changed every three hours versus every two hours. For the first week; the daycare center changed the diapers as usual every three hours and noted the number of days that each infant had symptoms of a diaper rash. During the second week; the teachers changed diapers every two hours and recorded the number of days with symptoms of a diaper rash.
