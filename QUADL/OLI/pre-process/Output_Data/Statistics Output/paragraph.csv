_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page, About This Course Many math classes are about following the rules.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"You learn a set of steps for doing a specific type of problem, and then you repeat those same steps to answer new problems."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,The result is that you can answer questions correctly by following the steps without ever understanding why you are following them.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,This course is not like that.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"In the words of one student: This course is designed to help students learn why and when specific rules are appropriate, not just how to use those rules."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"In order to succeed in this course, you need to understand the concepts of statistics so you can decide for yourself about the right ways to solve problems."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,Mastering both the concepts and the methods means that this course is harder—but also more useful—than a typical math class.

_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"In a nutshell, what statistics is all about is converting data into useful information."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"Statistics is therefore a process in which we Collect data, Summarize data, and Interpret data."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"To really understand how this process works, we need to put it in a context."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,We will do that by introducing one of the central ideas of this course—the Big Picture of Statistics.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,We will introduce the Big Picture by building it gradually and explaining each step.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"At the end of the introductory explanation, once you have the full Big Picture in front of you, we will show it again using a concrete example."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,The process of statistics starts when we identify what group we want to study or learn something about.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,We call this group the population.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"Note that the word population here (and in the entire course) does not refer only to people; it is used in the broader statistical sense to refer not only to people, but also to animals, objects, and so on."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"For example, we might be interested in The opinions of the population of U.S. adults about the death penalty How the population of mice react to a certain chemical The average price of the population of all one-bedroom apartments in a certain city Population, then, is the entire group that is the target of our interest: In most cases, the population is so large that, as much as we want to, there is absolutely no way we can study all of it (imagine trying to get the opinions of all U.S. adults about the death penalty)."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"A more practical approach would be to examine and collect data only from a subgroup of the population, which we call a sample."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"We call this first step, which involves choosing a sample and collecting data from it, producing data.It should be noted that since, for practical reasons, we need to compromise and examine only a sub-group of the population rather than the whole population, we should make an effort to choose a sample in such a way that it will represent the population well."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"For example, if we choose a sample from the population of U.S. adults, and ask their opinions about the death penalty, we do not want our sample to consist of only Republicans or only Democrats."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"Once the data have been collected, what we have is a long list of answers to questions, or numbers, and in order to explore and make sense of the data, we need to summarize that list in a meaningful way."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"This second step, which consists of summarizing the collected data, is called exploratory data analysis.Now we've obtained the sample results and summarized them, but we are not done."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"Remember that our goal is to study the population, so what we want is to be able to draw conclusions about the population based on the sample results."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"Before we can do so, we need to look at how the sample we're using may differ from the population as a whole, so that we can factor that into our analysis."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"To examine this difference, we use probability."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"In essence, probability is the ""machinery"" that allows us to draw conclusions about the population based on the data collected about the sample."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"Finally, we can use what we've discovered about our sample to draw conclusions about our population."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,We call this final step in the process inference.This is the Big Picture of statistics.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"At the end of April 2005, a poll was conducted (by ABC News and the Washington Post) for the purpose of learning the opinions of U.S. adults about the death penalty."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,1.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"Producing Data: A (representative) sample of 1,082 U.S. adults was chosen, and each adult was asked whether he or she favored or opposed the death penalty."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,2.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The collected data were summarized, and it was found that 65% of the sampled adults favor the death penalty for persons convicted of murder."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,3 and 4.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,"Probability and Inference: Based on the sample result (of 65% favoring the death penalty) and our knowledge of probability, it was concluded (with 95% confidence) that the percentage of those who favor the death penalty in the population is within 3% of what was obtained in the sample (i.e., between 62% and 68%)."
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,The following figure summarizes the example: Course Structure The structure of this entire course is based on the Big Picture.
_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,The course has one unit for each of the steps in the Big Picture.

_u1_intro_stats_online,x-oli-workbook_page,The following figure summarizes the structure of the course.

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"The Five Number Summary So far, in our discussion about measures of spread, the key players were: the extremes (min and Max), which provide the range covered by all the data; and the quartiles (Q1, M and Q3), which together provide the IQR, the range covered by the middle 50% of the data."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Boxplots are most useful when presented side-by-side for comparing and contrasting distributions from two or more groups.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Best Actor/Actress Oscar Winners So far we have examined the age distributions of Oscar winners for males and females separately.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,It will be interesting to compare the age distributions of actors and actresses who won best acting Oscars.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,To do that we will look at side-by-side boxplots of the age distributions by gender.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Recall also that we found the five-number summary and means for both distributions.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"For the Best Actress dataset, we did the calculations by hand."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"For the Best Actor dataset, we used statistical software, and here are the results we got: StatCrunch Actors: min = 31, Q1 = 38, M = 43.5, Q3 = 50.5, Max = 76 Actresses: min = 21, Q1 = 30.5, M = 34.5, Q3 = 42, Max = 80 Based on the graph and numerical measures, we can make the following comparison between the two distributions: Center: The graph reveals that the age distribution of the males is higher than the females' age distribution."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,This is supported by the numerical measures.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,The median age for females (34.5) is lower than for the males (43.5).

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Spread: Judging by the range of the data, there is much more variability in the females' distribution (range = 59) than there is in the males' distribution (range = 47)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"On the other hand, if we look at the IQR, which measures the variability only among the middle 50% of the distribution, we see slightly more spread in the ages of males (IQR = 12.5) than females (IQR = 11.5)."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Outliers: We see that we have outliers in both distributions.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"There is only one high outlier in the actors' distribution (76, Henry Fonda, On Golden Pond), compared with three high outliers in the actresses' distribution."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"As indicated in the introduction, we will begin the EDA part of the course by exploring (or looking at) one variable at a time."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"As we saw in the Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis, the data for each variable are a long list of values (whether numerical or not), and are not very informative in that form."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,In order to convert these raw data into useful information we need to summarize and then examine the distribution of the variable.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"By distribution of a variable, we mean: what values the variable takes, and how often the variable takes those values."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,This module has two sections.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"To display data from one quantitative variable graphically, we can use either the histogram or the stemplot."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions," Interpreting the Histogram Once the distribution has been displayed graphically, we can describe the overall pattern of the distribution and mention any striking deviations from that pattern."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"More specifically, we should consider the following features of the distribution: We will get a sense of the overall pattern of the data from the histogram's center, spread and shape, while outliers will highlight deviations from that pattern."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Shape When describing the shape of a distribution, we should consider: Symmetry/skewness of the distribution.Peakedness (modality)—the number of peaks (modes) the distribution has.We distinguish between: Symmetric Distributions Note that all three distributions are symmetric, but are different in their modality (peakedness)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,The first distribution is unimodal—it has one mode (roughly at 10) around which the observations are concentrated.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,The second distribution is bimodal—it has two modes (roughly at 10 and 20) around which the observations are concentrated.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"The third distribution is kind of flat, or uniform."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"The distribution has no modes, or no value around which the observations are concentrated."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Rather, we see that the observations are roughly uniformly distributed among the different values."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Skewed Right Distributions A distribution is called skewed right if, as in the histogram above, the right tail (larger values) is much longer than the left tail (small values)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Note that in a skewed right distribution, the bulk of the observations are small/medium, with a few observations that are much larger than the rest."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,An example of a real-life variable that has a skewed right distribution is salary.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Most people earn in the low/medium range of salaries, with a few exceptions (CEOs, professional athletes etc.)"
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"that are distributed along a large range (long ""tail"") of higher values."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Skewed Left Distributions A distribution is called skewed left if, as in the histogram above, the left tail (smaller values) is much longer than the right tail (larger values)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Note that in a skewed left distribution, the bulk of the observations are medium/large, with a few observations that are much smaller than the rest."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"An example of a real life variable that has a skewed left distribution is age of death from natural causes (heart disease, cancer etc.)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Most such deaths happen at older ages, with fewer cases happening at younger ages."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"If a distribution has more than two modes, we say that the distribution is multimodal."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Once the distribution has been displayed graphically, we can describe the overall pattern of the distribution and mention any striking deviations from that pattern."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"The distribution has no modes, or no value around which the observations are concentrated."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"A distribution is called skewed right if, as in the histogram above, the right tail (larger values) is much longer than the left tail (small values)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Note that in a skewed right distribution, the bulk of the observations are small/medium, with a few observations that are much larger than the rest."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,An example of a real-life variable that has a skewed right distribution is salary.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Most people earn in the low/medium range of salaries, with a few exceptions (CEOs, professional athletes etc.)"
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"A distribution is called skewed left if, as in the histogram above, the left tail (smaller values) is much longer than the right tail (larger values)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Note that in a skewed left distribution, the bulk of the observations are medium/large, with a few observations that are much smaller than the rest."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"An example of a real life variable that has a skewed left distribution is age of death from natural causes (heart disease, cancer etc.)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Most such deaths happen at older ages, with fewer cases happening at younger ages."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"If a distribution has more than two modes, we say that the distribution is multimodal."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"The overall pattern of the distribution of a quantitative variable is described by its shape, center, and spread."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"By inspecting the histogram, we can describe the shape of the distribution, but as we saw, we can only get a rough estimate for the center and spread."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"A description of the distribution of a quantitative variable must include, in addition to the graphical display, a more precise numerical description of the center and spread of the distribution."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions, Introduction So far we have learned about different ways to quantify the center of a distribution.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"A measure of center by itself is not enough, though, to describe a distribution."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Consider the following two distributions of exam scores.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Both distributions are centered at 70 (the median of both distributions is approximately 70), but the distributions are quite different."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,The first distribution has a much larger variability in scores compared to the second one.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"In order to describe the distribution, we therefore need to supplement the graphical display not only with a measure of center, but also with a measure of the variability (or spread) of the distribution."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"In this section, we will discuss the three most commonly used measures of spread: Range Inter-quartile range (IQR) Standard deviation Like the different measures of center, these measures provide different ways to quantify the variability of the distribution."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Range The range covered by the data is the most intuitive measure of variability.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,The range is exactly the distance between the smallest data point (min) and the largest one (Max).
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Range = Max - min Note: When we first looked at the histogram, and tried to get a first feel for the spread of the data, we were actually approximating the range, rather than calculating the exact range."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions," Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) While the range quantifies the variability by looking at the range covered by ALL the data, the IQR measures the variability of a distribution by giving us the range covered by the MIDDLE 50% of the data."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,The following picture illustrates this idea: (Think about the horizontal line as the data ranging from the min to the Max).
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Here is how the IQR is actually found: Arrange the data in increasing order, and find the median M. Recall that the median divides the data, so that 50% of the data points are below the median, and 50% of the data points are above the median."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Find the median of the lower 50% of the data.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"This is called the first quartile of the distribution, and the point is denoted by Q1."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Note from the picture that Q1 divides the lower 50% of the data into two halves, containing 25% of the data points in each half."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Q1 is called the first quartile, since one quarter of the data points fall below it."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Repeat this again for the top 50% of the data.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Find the median of the top 50% of the data.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"This point is called the third quartile of the distribution, and is denoted by Q3."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Note from the picture that Q3 divides the top 50% of the data into two halves, with 25% of the data points in each."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Q3 is called the third quartile, since three quarters of the data points fall below it."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"The middle 50% of the data falls between Q1 and Q3, and therefore: IQR = Q3 - Q1 Comments The last picture shows that Q1, M, and Q3 divide the data into four quarters with 25% of the data points in each, where the median is essentially the second quartile."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,The use of IQR = Q3 - Q1 as a measure of spread is therefore particularly appropriate when the median M is used as a measure of center.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,We can define a bit more precisely what is considered the bottom or top 50% of the data.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,The bottom (top) 50% of the data is all the observations whose position in the ordered list is to the left (right) of the location of the overall median M. The following picture will visually illustrate this for the simple cases of n = 7 and n = 8.

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Note from the picture that Q1 divides the lower 50% of the data into two halves, containing 25% of the data points in each half."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Q1 is called the first quartile, since one quarter of the data points fall below it."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,Repeat this again for the top 50% of the data.

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Q3 is called the third quartile, since three quarters of the data points fall below it."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions," The last picture shows that Q1, M, and Q3 divide the data into four quarters with 25% of the data points in each, where the median is essentially the second quartile."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,The use of IQR = Q3 - Q1 as a measure of spread is therefore particularly appropriate when the median M is used as a measure of center.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,We can define a bit more precisely what is considered the bottom or top 50% of the data.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,The bottom (top) 50% of the data is all the observations whose position in the ordered list is to the left (right) of the location of the overall median M. The following picture will visually illustrate this for the simple cases of n = 7 and n = 8.

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions, Understanding Outliers We just practiced one way to 'flag' possible outliers.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Why is it important to identify possible outliers, and how should they be dealt with?"
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,The answers to these questions depend on the reasons for the outlying values.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"Here are several possibilities: Even though it is an extreme value, if an outlier can be understood to have been produced by essentially the same sort of physical or biological process as the rest of the data, and if such extreme values are expected to eventually occur again, then such an outlier indicates something important and interesting about the process you're investigating, and it should be kept in the data.If an outlier can be explained to have been produced under fundamentally different conditions from the rest of the data (or by a fundamentally different process), such an outlier can be removed from the data if your goal is to investigate only the process that produced the rest of the data.mistake in the data (like a typo, or a measuring error), in which case it should be corrected if possible or else removed from the data before calculating summary statistics or making inferences from the data (and the reason for the mistake should be investigated)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"The following histogram displays the magnitude of 460 earthquakes in California, occurring in the year 2000, between August 28 and September 9: On the very far right edge of the display (beyond 4.8), we see a low bar; this represents one earthquake (because the bar has height of 1) that was much more severe than the others in the data."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"In this case, the outlier represents a much stronger earthquake, which is relatively rarer than the smaller quakes that happen more frequently in California."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"For many purposes, the relatively severe quakes represented by the outlier might be the most important (because, for instance, that sort of quake has the potential to do more damage to people and infrastructure)."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"The explanation for this particular outlier is that, in the early 1990s, there were highly-publicized federal hearings being conducted regarding the addictiveness of smoking, and there was growing public sentiment against the tobacco companies."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"The unusually low monthly value in the Phillip Morris dataset was due to public pressure against smoking, which negatively affected the company’s stock for that particular month."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m1_examining_distributions,"In this case, the outlier was due to unusual conditions during one particular month that aren’t expected to be repeated, and that were fundamentally different from the conditions that produced the values in all the other months."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"As you'll discover, exploring relationships of this type is something we've already discussed in this course, but we didn't frame the discussion this way."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,Hot Dogs Background: People who are concerned about their health may prefer hot dogs that are low in calories.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"A study was conducted by a concerned health group in which 54 major hot dog brands were examined, and their calorie contents recorded."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In addition, each brand was classified by type: beef, poultry, and meat (mostly pork and beef, but up to 15% poultry meat)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The purpose of the study was to examine whether the number of calories a hot dog has is related to (or affected by) its type.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"(Reference: Moore, David S., and George P. McCabe (1989)."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,")Answering this question requires us to examine the relationship between the categorical variable, Type and the quantitative variable Calories."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Because the question of interest is whether the type of hot dog affects calorie content, the explanatory variable is Type, andthe response variable is Calories.Here is what the raw data look like: The raw data are a list of types and calorie contents, and are not very useful in that form."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"To explore how the number of calories is related to the type of hot dog, we need an informative visual display of the data that will compare the three types of hot dogs with respect to their calorie content."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The visual display that we'll use is side-by-side boxplots (which we've seen before).
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"The side-by-side boxplots will allow us to compare the distribution of calorie counts within each category of the explanatory variable, hot dog type:As before, we supplement the side-by-side boxplots with the descriptive statistics of the calorie content (response) for each type of hot dog separately (i.e., for each level of the explanatory variable separately): Statistic Beef Meat Poultry min 111 107 86 Q1 139.5 138.5 100.5 Median 152.5 153 113 Q3 179.75 180.5 142.5 Max 190 195 152 Let's summarize the results we got and interpret them in the context of the question we posed: By examining the three side-by-side boxplots and the numerical summaries, we see at once that poultry hot dogs, as a group, contain fewer calories than those made of beef or meat."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The median number of calories in poultry hot dogs (113) is less than the median (and even the first quartile) of either of the other two distributions (medians 152.5 and 153).
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"The spread of the three distributions is about the same, if IQR is considered (all slightly above 40), but the (full) ranges vary slightly more (beef: 80, meat:88, poultry: 66)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The general recommendation to the health-conscious consumer is to eat poultry hot dogs.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"It should be noted, though, that since each of the three types of hot dogs shows quite a large spread among brands, simply buying a poultry hot dog does not guarantee a low-calorie food."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"What we learn from this example is that when exploring the relationship between a categorical explanatory variable and a quantitative response (Case C→Q), we essentially compare the distributions of the quantitative response for each category of the explanatory variable using side-by-side boxplots supplemented by descriptive statistics."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,Recall that we have actually done this before when we talked about the boxplot and argued that boxplots are most useful when presented side by side for comparing distributions of two or more groups.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Recall the role-type classification table for framing our discussion about the relationship between two variables: We are now ready to start with Case C→Q, exploring the relationship between two variables where the explanatory variable is categorical, and the response variable is quantitative."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships, Introduction So far we have discussed different ways in which data can be used to explore the relationship (or association) between two variables.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,To frame our discussion we followed the role-type classification table: cause changes in the response variable.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In other words, you might be tempted to interpret the observed association as causation."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The purpose of this part of the course is to convince you that this kind of interpretation is often wrong!
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,So far we have discussed different ways in which data can be used to explore the relationship (or association) between two variables.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,To frame our discussion we followed the role-type classification table: cause changes in the response variable.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In other words, you might be tempted to interpret the observed association as causation."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The purpose of this part of the course is to convince you that this kind of interpretation is often wrong!
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,Let's start by looking at the following example: Fire Damage The scatterplot below illustrates how the number of firefighters sent to fires (X) is related to the amount of damage caused by fires (Y) in a certain city.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The scatterplot clearly displays a fairly strong (slightly curved) positive relationship between the two variables.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Would it, then, be reasonable to conclude that sending more firefighters to a fire causes more damage, or that the city should send fewer firefighters to a fire, in order to decrease the amount of damage done by the fire?"
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,Of course not!
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,So what is going on here?There is a third variable in the background—the seriousness of the fire—that is responsible for the observed relationship.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"More serious fires require more firefighters, and also cause more damage.The following figure will help you visualize this situation: Here, the seriousness of the fire is a lurking variable."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables in a study, but could substantially affect your interpretation of the relationship among those variables.In particular, as in our example, the lurking variable might have an effect on both the explanatory and the response variables."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"This common effect creates the observed association between the explanatory and response variables, even though there is no causal link between them."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"So far, we have: discussed what lurking variables are, demonstrated different ways in which the lurking variables can interact with the two studied variables, and understood that the existence of a possible lurking variable is the main reason why we say that association does not imply causation."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"As you recall, a lurking variable, by definition, is a variable that was not included in the study, but could have a substantial effect on our understanding of the relationship between the two studied variables."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,What if we did include a lurking variable in our study?
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,What kind of effect could that have on our understanding of the relationship?
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"These are the questions we are going to discuss next.Let's start with an example: Hospital Death Rates Background: A government study collected data on the death rates in nearly 6,000 hospitals in the United States."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"These results were then challenged by researchers, who said that the federal analyses failed to take into account the variation among hospitals in the severity of patients' illnesses when they were hospitalized."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"As a result, said the researchers, some hospitals were treated unfairly in the findings, which named hospitals with higher-than-expected death rates."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,What the researchers meant is that when the federal government explored the relationship between the two variables—hospital and death rate—it also should have included in the study (or taken into account) the lurking variable—severity of illness.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"We will use a simplified version of this study to illustrate the researchers' claim, and see what the possible effect could be of including a lurking variable in a study."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,(Reference: Moore and McCabe (2003).
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,Introduction to the Practice of Statistics.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,")Consider the following two-way table, which summarizes the data about the status of patients who were admitted to two hospitals in a certain city (Hospital A and Hospital B)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Note that since the purpose of the study is to examine whether there is a ""hospital effect"" on patients' status, ""Hospital is the explanatory variable, and ""Patient's Status"" is the response variable."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,When we supplement the two-way table with the conditional percents within each hospital: we find that Hospital A has a higher death rate (3%) than Hospital B (2%).
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,Should we jump to the conclusion that a sick patient admitted to Hospital A is 50% more likely to die than if he/she were admitted to Hospital B?
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Not so fast ... Maybe Hospital A gets most of the severe cases, and that explains why it has a higher death rate."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In order to explore this, we need to include (or account for) the lurking variable ""severity of illness"" in our analysis."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"To do this, we go back to the two-way table and split it up to look separately at patents who are severely ill, and patients who are not."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"As we can see, Hospital A did admit many more severely ill patients than Hospital B (1,500 vs. 200)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In fact, from the way the totals were split, we see that in Hospital A, severely ill patients were a much higher proportion of the patients—1,500 out of a total of 2,100 patients."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In contrast, only 200 out of 800 patients at Hospital B were severely ill. To better see the effect of including the lurking variable, we need to supplement each of the two new two-way tables with its conditional percentages: Note that despite our earlier finding that overall Hospital A has a higher death rate (3% vs. 2%), when we take into account the lurking variable, we find that actually it is Hospital B that has the higher death rate both among the severely ill patients (4% vs. 3.8%) and among the not severely ill patients (1.3% vs. 1%)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Thus, we see that adding a lurking variable can change the direction of an association."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Whenever including a lurking variable causes us to rethink the direction of an association, this is called Simpson's paradox."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"So far we have dealt with data obtained from one variable (either categorical or quantitative), and learned how to describe the distribution of the variable using the appropriate visual displays and numerical measures."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In this section, examining relationships, we will look at two variables at a time and, as the title suggests, explore the relationship between them using (as before) visual displays and numerical summaries."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships, The Correlation Coefficient—r The numerical measure that assesses the strength of a linear relationship is called the correlation coefficient and is denoted by r. We will Define the correlation r. Discuss the calculation of r. Explain how to interpret the value of r. Talk about some of the properties of r. Definition: The correlation coefficient (r) is a numerical measure that measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Calculation: r is calculated using the following formula: r = 1 n - 1 ∑ i = 1 n ( x i - x ¯ S x ) ( y i - y ¯ S y ) However, the calculation of the correlation (r) is not the focus of this course."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"We will use a statistics package to calculate r for us, and the emphasis of this course is on the interpretation of its value."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Interpretation Once we obtain the value of r, its interpretation with respect to the strength of linear relationships is quite simple, as this walkthrough illustrates: To see a static version of this walkthrough, click here.To get a better sense of how the value of r relates to the strength of the linear relationship, take a look at the activity below."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships, Properties of r We now discuss and illustrate several important properties of the correlation coefficient as a numerical measure of the strength of a linear relationship.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The correlation does not change when the units of measurement of either one of the variables change.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In other words, if we change the units of measurement of the explanatory variable and/or the response variable, the change has no effect on the correlation (r).To illustrate, following are two versions of the scatterplot of the relationship between sign legibility distance and driver's age: The top scatterplot displays the original data where the maximum distances is measured in feet."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The bottom scatterplot displays the same relationship but with maximum distances changed to meters.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Notice that the Y-values have changed, but the correlations are the same."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"This example illustrates haw changing the units of measurement of the response variable has no effect on r, but as we indicated above, the same is true for changing the units of the explanatory variable, or of both variables."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,This might be a good place to comment that the correlation (r) is unitless.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,It is just a number.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The correlation measures only the strength of a linear relationship between two variables.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"It ignores any other type of relationship, no matter how strong it is."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"For example, consider the relationship between the average fuel usage of driving a fixed distance in a car, and the speed at which the car drives: Our data describe a fairly simple curvilinear relationship: the amount of fuel consumed decreases rapidly to a minimum for a car driving 60 kilometers per hour, and then increases gradually for speeds exceeding 60 kilometers per hour."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"The relationship is very strong, as the observations seem to perfectly fit the curve."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Although the relationship is strong, the correlation r = -0.172 indicates a weak linear relationship."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"This makes sense considering that the data fails to adhere closely to a linear form: The correlation is useless for assessing the strength of any type of relationship that is not linear (including relationships that are curvilinear, such as the one in our example)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Beware, then, of interpreting the fact that r is close to 0 as an indicator of a weak relationship rather than a weak linear relationship."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"This example also illustrates how important it is to always look at the data in the scatterplot because, as in our example, there might be a strong nonlinear relationship that r does not indicate.Since the correlation was nearly zero when the form of the relationship was not linear, we might ask if the correlation can be used to determine whether or not a relationship is linear."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The correlation by itself is not sufficient to determine whether a relationship is linear.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"To see this, let's consider the study that examined the effect of monetary incentives on the return rate of questionnaires."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Below is the scatterplot relating the percentage of participants who completed a survey to the monetary incentive that researchers promised to participants, in which we find a trong curvilinear relationship:The relationship is curvilinear, yet the correlation r = 0.876 is quite close to 1."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In the last two examples, we have seen two very strong curvilinear relationships, one with a correlation close to 0 and one with a correlation close to 1."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Therefore, the correlation alone does not indicate whether a relationship is linear."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The important principle here is: Always look at the data!
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The correlation is heavily influenced by outliers.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"As you will learn in the next two activities, the way in which the outlier influences the correlation depends on whether the outlier is consistent with the pattern of the linear relationship."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Using the applet below, we explore how an outlier affects the correlation."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"To see how an outlier affects the correlation, do the following: Fill the scatterplot with a hypothetical positive linear relationship between X and Y (by clicking on the graph about a dozen times starting at lower left and going up diagonally to the top right)."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Again, pay attention to what happens to the value of the correlation."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Hopefully, you've noticed the correlation decreasing when you created this kind of outlier, which is not consistent with the pattern of the relationship."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In the remainder of this section, we will introduce a way to find such a line, learn how to interpret it, and use it (cautiously) to make predictions.Again, let's start with a motivating example: Earlier, we examined the linear relationship between the age of a driver and the maximum distance at which a highway sign was legible, using both a scatterplot and the correlation coefficient."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Suppose a government agency wanted to predict the maximum distance at which the sign would be legible for 60-year-old drivers, and thus make sure that the sign could be used safely and effectively."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,How would we make this prediction?
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"To see a static version of this movie, click here How and why did we pick this particular line (the one shown in red in the above walkthrough) to describe the dependence of the maximum distance at which a sign is legible upon the age of a driver?"
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,What line exactly did we choose?
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The technique that specifies the dependence of the response variable on the explanatory variable is called regression.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"When that dependence is linear (which is the case in our examples in this section), the technique is called linear regression."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Linear regression is therefore the technique of finding the line that best fits the pattern of the linear relationship (or in other words, the line that best describes how the response variable linearly depends on the explanatory variable).To understand how such a line is chosen, consider the following very simplified version of the age-distance example (we left just 6 of the drivers on the scatterplot): There are many lines that look like they would be good candidates to be the line that best fits the data: It is doubtful that everyone would select the same line in the plot above."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"We need to agree on what we mean by ""best fits the data""; in other words, we need to agree on a criterion by which we would select this line."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,We want the line we choose to be close to the data points.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In other words, whatever criterion we choose, it had better somehow take into account the vertical deviations of the data points from the line, which are marked with blue arrows in the plot below: The most commonly used criterion is called the least squares criterion."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"This criterion says: Among all the lines that look good on your data, choose the one that has the smallest sum of squared vertical deviations."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Visually, each squared deviation is represented by the area of one of the squares in the plot below."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Therefore, we are looking for the line that will have the smallest total yellow area."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"least-squares regression line, and, as we'll see, it fits the linear pattern of the data very well."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"For the remainder of this lesson, you'll need to feel comfortable with the algebra of a straight line."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Like any other line, the equation of the least-squares regression line for summarizing the linear relationship between the response variable (Y) and the explanatory variable (X) has the form: Y = a + b X All we need to do is calculate the intercept a, and the slope b, which is easily done if we know: —the mean of the explanatory variable's values X ¯ S X—the standard deviation of the explanatory variable's values —the mean of the response variable's values Y ¯ S Y—the standard deviation of the response variable's values r—the correlation coefficient Given the five quantities above, the slope and intercept of the least squares regression line are found using the following formulas: b = r S Y S X a = Y ¯ − b X ¯ Comments Note that since the formula for the intercept a depends on the value of the slope, b, you need to find b first.The slope of the least squares regression line can be interpreted as the average change in the response variable when the explanatory variable increases by 1 unit."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In the previous two cases we had a categorical explanatory variable, and therefore exploring the relationship between the two variables was done by comparing the distribution of the response variable for each category of the explanatory variable: In case C→Q we compared distributions of the quantitative response."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,In case C→C we compared distributions of the categorical response.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Case Q→Q is different in the sense that both variables (in particular the explanatory variable) are quantitative, and therefore, as you'll discover, this case will require a different kind of treatment and tools."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Let's start with an example: Highway Signs A Pennsylvania research firm conducted a study in which 30 drivers (of ages 18 to 82 years old) were sampled, and for each one, the maximum distance (in feet) at which he/she could read a newly designed sign was determined."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"The goal of this study was to explore the relationship between a driver's age and the maximum distance at which signs were legible, and then use the study's findings to improve safety for older drivers."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"(Reference: Utts and Heckard, Mind on Statistics (2002)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Originally source: Data collected by Last Resource, Inc, Bellfonte, PA.)Since the purpose of this study is to explore the effect of age on maximum legibility distance, the explanatory variable is Age, andthe response variable is Distance.Here is what the raw data look like: Note that the data structure is such that for each individual (in this case driver 1....driver 30) we have a pair of values (in this case representing the driver's age and distance)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"We can therefore think about these data as 30 pairs of values: (18, 510), (32, 410), (55, 420), ... , (82, 360)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The first step in exploring the relationship between driver age and sign legibility distance is to create an appropriate and informative graphical display.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The appropriate graphical display for examining the relationship between two quantitative variables is the scatterplot.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Here is how a scatterplot is constructed for our example:To create a scatterplot, each pair of values is plotted, so that the value of the explanatory variable (X) is plotted on the horizontal axis, and the value of the response variable (Y) is plotted on the vertical axis."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In other words, each individual (driver, in our example) appears on the scatterplot as a single point whose X-coordinate is the value of the explanatory variable for that individual, and whose Y-coordinate is the value of the response variable."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Here is an illustration: Comment It is important to mention again that when creating a scatterplot, the explanatory variable should always be plotted on the horizontal X-axis, and the response variable should be plotted on the vertical Y-axis."

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships, Interpreting the scatterplot How do we explore the relationship between two quantitative variables using the scatterplot?
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"What should we look at, or pay attention to?"
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Recall that when we described the distribution of a single quantitative variable with a histogram, we described the overall pattern of the distribution (shape, center, spread) and any deviations from that pattern (outliers)."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,We do the same thing with the scatterplot.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"The following figure summarizes this point: As the figure explains, when describing the overall pattern of the relationship we look at its direction, form and strength."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"The direction of the relationship can be positive, negative, or neither:A positive (or increasing) relationship means that an increase in one of the variables is associated with an increase in the other.A negative (or decreasing) relationship means that an increase in one of the variables is associated with a decrease in the other.Not all relationships can be classified as either positive or negative."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,The form of the relationship is its general shape.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"When identifying the form, we try to find the simplest way to describe the shape of the scatterplot."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,There are many possible forms.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Here are a couple that are quite common: Relationships with a linear form are most simply described as points scattered about a line: Relationships with a curvilinear form are most simply described as points dispersed around the same curved line: There are many other possible forms for the relationship between two quantitative variables, but linear and curvilinear forms are quite common and easy to identify."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,Another form-related pattern that we should be aware of is clusters in the data: The strength of the relationship is determined by how closely the data follow the form of the relationship.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"Let's look, for example, at the following two scatterplots displaying positive, linear relationships:The strength of the relationship is determined by how closely the data points follow the form."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,We can see that in the top scatterplot the data points follow the linear pattern quite closely.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,This is an example of a strong relationship.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In the bottom scatterplot, the points also follow the linear pattern, but much less closely, and therefore we can say that the relationship is weaker."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,"In general, though, assessing the strength of a relationship just by looking at the scatterplot is quite problematic, and we need a numerical measure to help us with that."
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,We will discuss that later in this section.

_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,There are studies in which the role classification is not really clear.
_u2_summarizing_data,_m2_examining_relationships,This mainly happens in cases when both variables are categorical or both are quantitative.

_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"The purpose of exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to convert the available data from their raw form to an informative one, in which the main features of the data are illuminated."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"When performing EDA, we should always: use visual displays (graphs or tables) plus numerical summaries."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,describe the overall pattern and mention any striking deviations from that pattern.
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,interpret the results we got in context.
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"When examining the distribution of a single variable, we distinguish between a categorical variable and a quantitative variable.The distribution of a categorical variable is summarized using: Display: pie-chart or bar-chart (variation: pictogram → can be misleading—beware!)"
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,Numerical summaries: category (group) percentages.
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"The distribution of a quantitative variable is summarized using: Display: histogram (or stemplot, mainly for small data sets)."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"When describing the distribution as displayed by the histogram, we should describe the: Overall pattern → shape, center, spread."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,Deviations from the pattern → outliers.
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Numerical summaries: descriptive statistics (measure of center plus measure of spread): If distribution is symmetric with no outliers, use mean and standard deviation."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Otherwise, use the five-number summary, in particular, median and IQR (inter-quartile range)."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,The five-number summary and the 1.5(IQR) Criterion for detecting outliers are the ingredients we need to build the boxplot.
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Boxplots are most effective when used side-by-side for comparing distributions (see also case C→Q in examining relationships).In the special case of a distribution having the normal shape, the Standard Deviation Rule applies."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"This rule tells us approximately what percent of the observations fall within 1,2, or 3 standard deviations away from the mean."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"In particular, when a distribution is approximately normal, almost all the observations (99.7%) fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean.When examining the relationship between two variables, the first step is to classify the two relevant variables according to their role and type: Case C→Q: Exploring the relationship amounts to comparing the distributions of the quantitative response variable for each category of the explanatory variable."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"To do this, we use: Display: side-by-side boxplots."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Numerical summaries: descriptive statistics of the response variable, for each value (category) of the explanatory variable separately."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Case C→C: Exploring the relationship amounts to comparing the distributions of the categorical response variable, for each category of the explanatory variable."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"To do this, we use: Display: two-way table."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,Numerical summaries: conditional percentages (of the response variable for each value (category) of the explanatory variable separately).
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,Case Q→Q: We examine the relationship using: Display: scatterplot.
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"When describing the relationship as displayed by the scatterplot, be sure to consider: Labeling the scatterplot (including a relevant third categorical variable in our analysis), might add some insight into the nature of the relationship."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Overall pattern → direction, form, strength."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,Deviations from the pattern → outliers.
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"In the special case that the scatterplot displays a linear relationship (and only then), we supplement the scatterplot with: Numerical summaries: the correlation coefficient (r) measures the direction and, more importantly, the strength of the linear relationship."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"The closer r is to 1 (or -1), the stronger the positive (or negative) linear relationship."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"r is unitless, influenced by outliers, and should be used only as a supplement to the scatterplot."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"When the relationship is linear (as displayed by the scatterplot, and supported by the correlation r), we can summarize the linear pattern using the least squares regression line."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,Remember that: The slope of the regression line tells us the average change in the response variable that results from a 1-unit increase in the explanatory variable.
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"When using the regression line for predictions, you should beware of extrapolation."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page," The algebra of a line A line is described by a set of points (X,Y) that obey a particular relationship between X and Y ."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"That relationship is called the equation of the line, which we will express in the following form: a and b are constants that can be either negative or positive."
_u2_summarizing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"The reason to write the line in this form is that the constants a and b tell us what the line looks like, as follows: The intercept (a) is the value that Y takes when X = 0 The slope (b) is the change in Y for every increase of 1 unit in X ."

_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"As mentioned in the introduction to this section, we will begin with the first stage of data production—sampling."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"Our discussion will be framed around the following examples: #1 Suppose you want to determine the musical preferences of all students at your university, based on a sample of students."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,Here are some examples of the many possible ways to pursue this problem.
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"Post a music-lovers' survey on a university IInternet bulletin board, asking students to vote for their favorite type of music."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"This is an example of a volunteer sample, where individuals have selected themselves to be included."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,Such a sample is almost guaranteed to be biased.
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"In general, volunteer samples tend to be comprised of individuals who have a particularly strong opinion about an issue, and are looking for an opportunity to voice it."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"Whether the variable's values obtained from such a sample are over- or under-stated, and to what extent, cannot be determined."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"As a result, data obtained from a voluntary response sample is quite useless when you think about the ""Big Picture,"" since the sampled individuals only provide information about themselves, and we cannot generalize to any larger group at all."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,Comment: It should be mentioned that in some cases volunteer samples are the only ethical way to obtain a sample.
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"In medical studies, for example, in which new treatments are tested, subjects must choose to participate by signing a consent form that highlights the potential risks and benefits."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"As we will discuss in the next module, a volunteer sample is not so problematic in a study conducted for the purpose of comparing several treatments.#2 Stand outside the Student Union, across from the Fine Arts Building, and ask students passing by to respond to your question about musical preference."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"convenience sample, where individuals happen to be at the right time and place to suit the schedule of the researcher."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"Depending on what variable is being studied, it may be that a convenience sample provides a fairly representative group."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"However, there are often subtle reasons why the sample's results are biased."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"In this case, the proximity to the Fine Arts Building might result in a disproportionate number of students favoring classical music."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,A convenience sample may also be susceptible to bias because certain types of individuals are more likely to be selected than others.
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"In the extreme, some convenience samples are designed in such a way that certain individuals have no chance at all of being selected, as in the next example.#3 Ask your professors for email rosters of all the students in your classes."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"Randomly sample some addresses, and email those students with your question about musical preference."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,sampling frame—list of potential individuals to be sampled—does not match the population of interest.
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"The population of interest consists of all students at the university, whereas the sampling frame consists of only your classmates."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,There may be bias arising because of this discrepancy.
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"For example, students with similar majors will tend to take the same classes as you, and their musical preferences may also be somewhat different from those of the general population of students."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,It is always best to have the sampling frame match the population as closely as possible.
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"#4 Obtain a student directory with email addresses of all the university's students, and send the music poll to every 50th name on the list."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,This is called systematic sampling.
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"It may not be subject to any clear bias, but it would not be as safe as taking a random sample."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,simple random sample (SRS).
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"In contrast, a systematic sample would not allow for sibling students to be selected, because of having the same last name."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"In a simple random sample, sibling students would have just as much of a chance of both being selected as any other pair of students."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"Therefore, there may be subtle sources of bias in using a systematic sampling plan.#5 Obtain a student directory with email addresses of all the university's students, and send your music poll to a simple random sample of students."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"As long as all of the students respond, then the sample is not subject to any bias, and should succeed in being representative of the population of interest."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,But what if only 40% of those selected email you back with their vote?
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"The results of this poll would not necessarily be representative of the population, because of the potential problems associated with volunteer response."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"Since individuals are not compelled to respond, often a relatively small subset take the trouble to participate."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"Volunteer response is not as problematic as a volunteer sample (presented in example 1 above), but there is still a danger that those who do respond are different from those who don't, with respect to the variable of interest."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"An improvement would be to follow up with a second email, asking politely for students' cooperation."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"This may boost the response rate, resulting in a sample that is fairly representative of the entire population of interest, and it may be the best that you can do, under the circumstances."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,In this short module we learned various techniques by which one can choose a sample of individuals from an entire population to collect data from.
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"This is seemingly a simple step in the big picture of statistics, but it turns out that it has a crucial effect on the conclusions we can draw from the sample about the entire population (i.e., inference)."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"Generally speaking, a probability sampling plan (such as a simple random sample, cluster, or stratified sampling) will result in a nonbiased sample, which can be safely used to make inferences."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"Moreover, the inferential procedures that we will learn later in this course assume that the sample was chosen at random."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"That being said, other (nonrandom) sampling techniques are available, and sometimes using them is the best we can do."
_u3_producing_data,_m1_sampling,"It is important, though, when these techniques are used, to be aware of the types of bias that they introduce, and thus the limitations of the conclusions that can be drawn from the resulting samples."

_u3_producing_data,_m2_design," Causation and Observational Studies Suppose the observational study described on the previous page were carried out, and researchers determined that the percentage succeeding with the combination drug/therapy method was highest, while the percentage succeeding with neither therapy nor drugs was lowest."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"In other words, suppose there is clear evidence of an association between method used and success rate."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Could they then conclude that the combination drug/therapy method causes success more than using neither therapy nor a drug?
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"It is at precisely this point that we confront the underlying weakness of most observational studies: some members of the sample have opted for certain values of the explanatory variable (method of quitting), while others have opted for other values."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,It could be that those individuals may be different in additional ways that would also play a role in the response of interest.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"For instance, suppose women are more likely to choose certain methods to quit, and suppose women in general tend to quit more successfully than men."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"The data would make it appear that the method itself were responsible for success, whereas in truth it may just be that being female is the reason for success."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,We can express this scenario in terms of the key variables involved.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"In addition to the explanatory variable (method) and the response variable (success or failure), a third, lurking variable (gender) is tied in (or confounded) with the explanatory variable's values, and may itself cause the response to be success or failure."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"The following diagram illustrates this situation.Since the difficulty arises because of the lurking variable's values being tied in with those of the explanatory variable, one way to attempt to unravel the true nature of the relationship between explanatory and response variables is to separate out the effects of the lurking variable."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"In general, we control for the effects of a lurking variable by separately studying groups that are similar with respect to this variable."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"We could control for the lurking variable ""gender"" by studying women and men separately."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Then, if both women and men who chose one method have higher success rates than those opting for another method, we would be closer to producing evidence of causation."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,The diagram above demonstrates how straightforward it is to control for the lurking variable gender.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Notice that we did not claim that controlling for gender would allow us to make a definite claim of causation, only that we would be closer to establishing a causal connection."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"This is due to the fact that other lurking variables may also be involved, such as the level of the participants' desire to quit."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Specifically, those who have chosen to use the drug/therapy method may already be the ones who are most determined to succeed, while those who have chosen to quit without investing in drugs or therapy may, from the outset, be less committed to quitting."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,The following diagram illustrates this scenario.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"To attempt to control for this lurking variable, we could interview the individuals at the outset in order to rate their desire to quit on a scale of 1 (weakest) to 5 (strongest), and study the relationship between method and success separately for each of the five groups."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"But desire to quit is obviously a very subjective thing, difficult to assign a specific number to."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Realistically, we may be unable to effectively control for the lurking variable ""desire to quit."""
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Furthermore, who's to say that gender and/or desire to quit are the only lurking variables involved?"
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,There may be other subtle differences among individuals who choose one of the four various methods that researchers fail to imagine as they attempt to control for possible lurking variables.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"For example, smokers who opt to quit using neither therapy nor drugs may tend to be in a lower income bracket than those who opt for (and can afford) drugs and/or therapy."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Perhaps smokers in a lower income bracket also tend to be less successful in quitting because more of their family members and co-workers smoke.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Thus, socioeconomic status is yet another possible lurking variable in the relationship between cessation method and success rate."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,It is because of the existence of a virtually unlimited number of potential lurking variables that we can never be 100% certain of a claim of causation based on an observational study.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"On the other hand, observational studies are an extremely common tool used by researchers to attempt to draw conclusions about causal connections."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Suppose the observational study described on the previous page were carried out, and researchers determined that the percentage succeeding with the combination drug/therapy method was highest, while the percentage succeeding with neither therapy nor drugs was lowest."

_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"On the other hand, observational studies are an extremely common tool used by researchers to attempt to draw conclusions about causal connections."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Observational studies are subject to other pitfalls besides lurking variables, arising from various aspects of the design for evaluating the explanatory and response values."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,The next pair of examples illustrates some other difficulties that may arise.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Suppose researchers want to determine if people tend to snack more while they watch TV.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"One possible design that we considered was to recruit participants for an observational study, and give them journals to record their hourly activities the following day, including TV watched and snacks consumed."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Then they could review the journals to determine if snack consumption was higher during TV times.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"We identified this as a prospective observational study, carried forward in time."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Studying people in the more natural setting of their own homes makes the study more realistic than a contrived experimental setting.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Still, when people are obliged to record their behavior as it occurs, they may be too self-conscious to act naturally."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"They may want to avoid embarrassment and so they may cut back on their TV viewing, or their snack consumption, or the combination of the two."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Yet another possible design is to recruit participants for a retrospective observational study.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Ask them to recall, for each hour of the previous day, whether they were watching TV, and what snacks they consumed each hour."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Determine if food consumption was higher during the TV times.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,This design has the advantage of not disturbing people's natural behavior in terms of TV viewing or snacking.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,It has the disadvantage of relying on people's memories to record those variables' values from the day before.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"But one day is a relatively short period of time to remember such details, and as long as people are willing to be honest, the results of this study could be fairly reliable."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,The issue of eliciting honest responses will be addressed in our discussion of sample surveys.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"By now you should have an idea of how difficult—or perhaps even impossible—it is to establish causation in an observational study, especially due to the problem of lurking variables."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"The key to establishing causation is to rule out the possibility of any lurking variable, or in other words, to ensure that individuals differ only with respect to the values of the explanatory variable."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design," Causation and Experiments Recall that in an experiment, it is the researchers who assign values of the explanatory variable to the participants."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,The key to ensuring that individuals differ only with respect to explanatory values—which is also the key to establishing causation—lies in the way this assignment is carried out.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Let's return to the smoking cessation study as a context to explore the essential ingredients of experimental design.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"In our discussion of the distinction between observational studies and experiments, we described the following experiment: collect a representative sample of 1,000 individuals from the population of smokers who are just now trying to quit."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,We divide the sample into 4 groups of 250 and instruct each group to use a different method to quit.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"One year later, we contact the same 1,000 individuals and determine whose attempts succeeded while using our designated method."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"This was an experiment, because the researchers themselves determined the values of the explanatory variable of interest for the individuals studied, rather than letting them choose."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,We will begin by using the context of this smoking cessation example to illustrate the specialized vocabulary of experiments.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"First of all, the explanatory variable, or factor, in this case is the method used to quit."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"The different imposed values of the explanatory variable, or treatments (common abbreviation: ttt), consist of the four possible quitting methods."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,The groups receiving different treatments are called treatment groups.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,The group that tries to quit without drugs or therapy could be called the control group—those individuals on whom no specific treatment was imposed.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Ideally, the subjects (human participants in an experiment) in each treatment group differ from those in the other treatment groups only with respect to the treatment (quitting method)."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"As mentioned in our discussion of why lurking variables prevent us from establishing causation in observational studies, eliminating all other differences among treatment groups will be the key to asserting causation via an experiment."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,How can this be accomplished?
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Randomized Controlled Experiments Your intuition may already tell you, correctly, that andom assignment to treatments is the best way to prevent treatment groups of individuals from differing from each other in ways other than the treatment assigned."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Either computer software or tables can be utilized to accomplish the random assignment.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"The resulting design is called a randomized controlled experiment, because researchers control values of the explanatory variable with a randomization procedure."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Under random assignment, the groups should not differ significantly with respect to any potential lurking variable."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Then, if we see a relationship between the explanatory and response variables, we have evidence that it is a causal one."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Comment Note that in a randomized controlled experiment, a randomization procedure may be used in two phases."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"First, a sample of subjects is collected."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Ideally it would be a random sample so that it would be perfectly representative of the entire population.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,(Comment: often researchers have no choice but to recruit volunteers.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Using volunteers may help to offset one of the drawbacks to experimentation which will be discussed later, namely the problem of noncompliance.)"
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Second, we assign individuals randomly to the treatment groups to ensure that the only difference between them will be due to the treatment and we can get evidence of causation."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"At this stage, randomization is vital."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Let's discuss some other issues related to experimentation.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Inclusion of a Control Group A common misconception is that an experiment must include a control group of individuals receiving no treatment.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"There may be situations where a complete lack of treatment is not an option, or where including a control group is ethically questionable, or where researchers explore the effects of a treatment without making a comparison."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Here are a few examples: If doctors want to conduct an experiment to determine whether Prograf or Cyclosporin is more effective as an immunosuppressant, they could randomly assign transplant patients to take one or the other of the drugs."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"It would, of course, be unethical to include a control group of patients not receiving any immunosuppressants."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Recently, experiments have been conducted in which the treatment is a highly invasive brain surgery."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,The only way to have a legitimate control group in this case is to randomly assign half of the subjects to undergo the entire surgery except for the actual treatment component (inserting stem cells into the brain).
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"This, of course, is also ethically problematic (but, believe it or not, is being done)."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,There may even be an experiment designed with only a single treatment.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"For example, makers of a new hair product may ask a sample of individuals to treat their hair with that product over a period of several weeks, then assess how manageable their hair has become."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Such a design is clearly flawed because of the absence of a comparison group, but it is still an experiment because use of the product has been imposed by its manufacturers, rather than chosen naturally by the individuals."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,A flawed experiment is nevertheless an experiment.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Comment: The word control is used in at least three different senses.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"In the context of observational studies, we control for a confounding variable by separating it out."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Referring to an experiment as a controlled experiment stresses that the values of the experiment's explanatory variables (factors) have been assigned by researchers, as opposed to having occurred naturally."

_u3_producing_data,_m2_design," Introduction Obviously, sampling is not done for its own sake."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"After this first stage in the data production process is completed, we come to the second stage, that of gaining information about the variables of interest from the sampled individuals."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,In this module we'll discuss three study designs; each design enables you to determine the values of the variables in a different way.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"You can: - Carry out an observational study, in which values of the variable or variables of interest are recorded as they naturally occur."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"There is no interference by the researchers who conduct the study.- Take a sample survey, which is a particular type of observational study in which individuals report variables' values themselves, frequently by giving their opinions."

_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Instead of assessing the values of the variables as they naturally occur, the researchers interfere, and they are the ones who assign the values of the explanatory variable to the individuals."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"The researchers ""take control"" of the values of the explanatory variable because they want to see how changes in the value of the explanatory variable affect the response variable."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"(Note: By nature, any experiment involves at least two variables."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,")The type of design used, and the details of the design, are crucial, since they will determine what kind of conclusions we may draw from the results."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"In particular, when studying relationships in the Exploratory Data Analysis unit, we stressed that an association between two variables does not guarantee that a causal relationship exists."

_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Researchers have several options to choose from when deciding how to survey the individuals involved: in person, or via telephone, Internet, or mail."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,The following issues in the design of sample surveys will be discussed: * open vs. closed questions * unbalanced response options * leading questions * planting ideas with questions * complicated questions * sensitive questions These issues are best illustrated with a variety of concrete examples.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Suppose you want to determine the musical preferences of all students at your university, based on a sample of students."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"In the Sampling section, we discussed various ways to obtain the sample, such as taking a simple random sample from all students at the university, then contacting the chosen subjects via email to request their responses and following up with a second email to those who did not respond the first time."

_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Let us consider some possibilities: Question: ""What is your favorite kind of music?"
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"""This is what we call an open question, which allows for almost unlimited responses."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,It may be difficult to make sense of all the possible categories and subcategories of music that survey respondents could come up with.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Some may be more general than what you had in mind (""I like modern music the best"") and others too specific (""I like Japanese alternative electronic rock by Cornelius"")."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Responses are much easier to handle if they come from a closed question: Question: Which of these types of music do you prefer: classical, rock, pop, or hip-hop?What will happen if a respondent is asked the question as worded above, and he or she actually prefers jazz or folk music or gospel?"
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"He or she may pick a second-favorite from the options presented, or try to pencil in the real preference, or may just not respond at all."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Whatever the outcome, it is likely that overall, the responses to the question posed in this way will not give us very accurate information about general music preferences."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"If a closed question is used, then great care should be taken to include all the reasonable options that are possible, including ""not sure."""
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Also, in case an option was overlooked, ""other:___________"" should be included for the sake of thoroughness."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Many surveys ask respondents to assign a rating to a variable, such as in the following: Question: How do you feel about classical music?"

_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,In this module we distinguished among different types of studies and learned the details of each type of study design.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"By doing so, we also expanded our understanding of the issue of establishing causation that was first discussed in the previous unit of the course."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"In the Exploratory Data Analysis unit, we learned that in general, association does not imply causation, due to the fact that lurking variables might be responsible for the association we observe, which means we cannot establish that there is a causal relationship between our ""explanatory"" variable and our response variable."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,In this module we completed the causation puzzle by learning under what circumstances an observed association between variables CAN be interpreted as causation.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"We saw that in observational studies, the best we can do is to control for what we think might be potential lurking variables, but we can never be sure that there aren't any others that we didn't anticipate."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Therefore, we can come closer to establishing causation, but never really establish it."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"The only way we can, at least in theory, eliminate the effect of (or control for) ALL lurking variables is by conducting a randomized control experiment, in which subjects are randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Only in this case can we interpret an observed association as causation.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Obviously, due to ethical or other practical reasons, not every study can be conducted as a randomized experiment."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"Where possible, however, a double-blind randomized control experiment is about the best study design we can use."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,Another very common study design is the survey.
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"While a survey is a special kind of observational study, it really is treated as a separate design, since it is so common and is the type of study that the general public is most often exposed to (polls)."
_u3_producing_data,_m2_design,"It is important that we be aware of the fact that the wording, ordering, or type of questions asked in a poll could have a impact on the response."

_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"For example, if researchers want to determine whether the antidepressant Zoloft is effective for teenagers in general, then it would not be a good idea to only test it on a sample of teens who have been admitted to a psychiatric hospital, because their depression may be more severe, and less treatable, than that of teens in general."

_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Recall ""The Big Picture,"" the four-step process that encompasses statistics: data production, exploratory data analysis, probability, and inference."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"In the previous unit, we considered exploratory data analysis—the discovery of patterns in the raw data."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"In this unit, we go back and examine the first step in the process: the production of data."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"In this unit, we discussed the first step in the big picture of statistics— production of data."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Production of data happens in two stages: sampling and study design.Our goal in sampling is to get a sample that represents the population of interest well, so that when we get to the inference stage, making conclusions based on this sample about the entire population will make sense."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"We discussed several biased sampling plans, but also introduced the ""family"" of probability sampling plans, the simplest of which is the simple random sample, that (at least in theory) are supposed to provide a sample that is not subject to any biases.In the section on study design, we introduced 3 types of design: observational study, controlled experiment, and sample survey."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"We saw that with observational studies it is difficult to establish convincing evidence of a causal relationship, because of lack of control over outside variables (called lurking variables)."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Other pitfalls that may arise are that individuals' behaviors may be affected if they know they are participating in an observational study, and that individuals' memories may be faulty if they are asked to recall information from the past."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Experiments allow researchers to take control of lurking variables by randomized assignment to treatments, which helps provide more convincing evidence of causation."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,The design may be enhanced by making sure that subjects and/or researchers are blind to who receives what treatment.
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Depending on what relationship is being researched, it may be difficult to design an experiment whose setting is realistic enough that we can safely generalize the conclusions to real life.Another reason that observational studies are utilized rather than experiments is that certain explanatory variables—such as income or alcohol intake—either cannot or should not be controlled by researchers."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Sample surveys are occasionally used to examine relationships, but often they assess values of many separate variables, such as respondents' opinions on various matters."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Survey questions should be designed carefully, in order to ensure unbiased assessment of the variables' values.Throughout this unit, we established guidelines for the ideal production of data, which should be held as standards to strive for."
_u3_producing_data,x-oli-workbook_page,"Realistically, however, it is rarely possible to carry out a study which is completely free of flaws."
_u4_probability,_m1_finding_probability,"In the previous module, we introduced probability as a way to quantify the uncertainty that arises from conducting experiments using a random sample of the population of interest."
_u4_probability,_m1_finding_probability,"We saw that the probability of an event (for example, the event that a randomly chosen person has blood type O) can be estimated by the relative frequency with which the event occurs in a long series of trials."
_u4_probability,_m1_finding_probability,So we would collect data from lots of individuals to estimate the probability of someone having blood type O.

_u4_probability,_m1_finding_probability,"You probably noticed that the probability section was significantly different from the two previous sections; it has a much larger technical/mathematical component, so the results tend to be more of the ""right or wrong"" nature."

_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Let's illustrate this idea with a simple example: All the students in a certain high school were surveyed, then classified according to gender and whether they had either of their ears pierced: (Note that this is a two-way table of counts that was first introduced when we talked about the relationship between two categorical variables."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"It is not surprising that we are using it again in this example, since we indeed have two categorical variables here: Gender: M or F (in our notation, ""not M""), and Pierced: Yes or No)Suppose a student is selected at random from the school."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Let M and not M denote the events of being male and female, respectively, and E and not E denote the events of having ears pierced or not, respectively."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"We'll start by asking what will seem like simple questions, and we'll build our way to conditional probability: What is the probability that the student has one or both ears pierced?"
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Since a student is chosen at random from the group of 500 students, out of which 324 are pierced, What is the probability that the student is male?"
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Since a student is chosen at random from the group of 500 students, out of which 180 are male, What is the probability that the student is male and has ear(s) pierced?"
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Since a student is chosen at random from the group of 500 students out of which 36 are male and have their ear(s) pierced, P(M and E) = 36/500 = .072 Given that the student that was chosen is male, what is the probability that he has one or both ears pierced?P(E | M)."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"A word about this new notation: The event whose probability we seek (in this case E) is written first, the vertical line stands for the word ""given"" or ""conditioned on,"" and the event that is given (in this case M) is written after the ""|"" sign."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"We call this probability the conditional probability of having one or both ears pierced, given that a student is male: it assesses the probability of having pierced ears under the condition of being male."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Now to solve for the probability, we observe that choosing from only the males in the school essentially alters the sample space S from all students in the school to all male students in the school."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"The total number of possible outcomes is no longer 500, but has changed to 180."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Now that we have an understanding of conditional probabilities and can express them with concise notation, and have a more formal understanding of what it means for two events to be independent, we can finally establish the General Multiplication Rule, a formal rule for finding P(A and B) that applies to any two events, whether they are independent or dependent."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,We begin with an example that contrasts P(A and B) for independent and dependent cases.
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Suppose you pick two cards at random from four cards consisting of one of each suit: club, diamond, heart, and spade, where the first card is replaced before the second card is picked."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,What is the probability of picking a club and then a diamond?
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Because the sampling is done with replacement, whether or not a diamond is picked on the second selection is independent of whether or not a club has been picked on the first selection."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Rule 5, the multiplication rule for independent events, tells us that: P(C1 and D2) = P(C1) * P(D2) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"[Here we denote the event ""club picked on first selection"" as C1 and the event ""diamond picked on second selection"" as D2.]"
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"The display below shows that 1/4 of the time we'll pick a club first, and of these times, 1/4 will result in a diamond on the second pick: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 of the selections will have a club first and then a diamond."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Suppose you pick two cards at random from four cards consisting of one of each suit: club, diamond, heart, and spade, without replacing the first card before the second card is picked."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,What is the probability of picking a club and then a diamond?
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"The probability in this case is not 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16; because the sampling is done without replacement, so whether or not a diamond is picked on the second selection does depend on what was picked on the first selection."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"(For instance, if a diamond was picked on the first selection, the probability of another diamond is zero!)"
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"As in the example above, 1/4 of the time we'll pick a club first."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"But since the club has been removed, 1/3 of these selections with a club first will have a diamond second."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"The probability of a club and then a diamond is 1/4*1/3=1/12; this is the probability of getting a club first, multiplied by the probability of getting a diamond second, given that a club was picked first."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Using the notation of conditional probabilities, we can writeP(C1 and D2) = P(C1) * P(D2 | C1) = 1/4 * 1/3 = 1/12."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"For independent events A and B, we had the rule P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Due to independence, to find the probability of both, we could multiply the probability of A by the simple probability of B, because the occurrence of A would have no effect on the probability of B occurring."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Now, for events A and B that may be dependent, to find the probability of both, we multiply the probability of A by the conditional probability of B, taking into account that A has occurred."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Now that we understand how to construct the probability tree, let's use the tree to answer some questions: What is the overall probability that the sales rep will take the Bermuda vacation?"
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Notice that a V branch can be reached by either a C or a not C branch: either the sales rep gets the commission and takes the vacation, or he does not get the commission and he takes the vacation."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Symbolically, V = (C and V) or (not C and V)."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Thus, the overall probability of taking the vacation is P(V) = P( (C and V) or (not C and V) )."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Applying the Addition Rule for Disjoint Events, we have P(V) = P(C and V) + P(not C and V)."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Applying the General Multiplication Rule to each term, we have P(V) = P(C) * P(V | C) + P(not C) * P(V | not C) = .4 * .9 + .6 * .3 = .36 + .18 = .54."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,The overall probability that the sales rep will take the Bermuda vacation is .54.
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"The tree diagram below shows the probabilities obtained via the general multiplication rule, and then the addition rule."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Comment Following one branch to a connected branch, such as C then V, represents the occurrence of one event and then another, which requires multiplication of probabilities."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Including outcomes reached via either of two end-branches represents the occurrence of one event or another, which requires addition of probabilities."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"In order to illustrate the background situation of either getting the commission or not—which together make up the whole sample space S—along with the follow-up circumstance of either taking the vacation or not, we can draw a different sort of Venn diagram: The diagram shows that V = (C and V) or (not C and V), where (C and V) and (not C and V) are disjoint."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Applying first the Addition Rule for Disjoint Events and then the General Multiplication Rule, we have P(V) = P(C and V) + P(not C and V) = P(C) * P(V | C) + P(not C) * P(V | not C), just as we saw in our tree diagram."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"We can generalize our solution to obtain an expression for the probability of any event B, based on how B is impacted by the occurrence or non-occurrence of some other event A."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,We call this the Law of Total Probability: P(B) = P(A) * P(B | A) + P(not A) * P(B | not A).
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,Suppose the friend finds out that the sales rep has left for Bermuda.
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,Is it likely that the commission came through?
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Find the probability that the commission came through, given that the sales rep went to Bermuda."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Here, we are asked to find the probability that the commission came through, given that the sales rep took his Bermuda vacation, P(C | V)."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Using the definition of conditional probability, P(C | V) = P(C and V) / P(V) and now, using the tree, and our result from part (a) (P(V) = .54)), we get that: P(C | V) = P(C and V) / P(V) = .36/.54 = .67 Thus, if it is known that the sales rep left for the Bermuda vacation, it is more likely than not that the commission came through."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Comment Ordinarily, when events occur in stages, the explanatory variable would be the occurrence or non-occurrence of a certain event at the first stage, and the response variable would be the occurrence or non-occurrence of the next event chronologically."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"In such cases, we would identify the probability of a certain response, given that the explanatory variable took a certain value."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"However, there are sometimes situations, as in the second example above, where what we know is the ultimate outcome, and what we want to find out is the probability that a certain event occurred previously."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Following one branch to a connected branch, such as C then V, represents the occurrence of one event and then another, which requires multiplication of probabilities."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Including outcomes reached via either of two end-branches represents the occurrence of one event or another, which requires addition of probabilities."

_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,This module introduced you to the fundamental concept of conditional probability—the probability of an event given that another event has occurred.
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"We saw that sometimes the knowledge that another event has occurred has no impact on the probability (when the two events are independent), and sometimes it does (when the two events are not independent).We further discussed the idea of independence and discussed different ways to check whether two events are independent or not."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"Understanding the concept of conditional probability also allowed us to introduce our final probability rule, the General Multiplication Rule."
_u4_probability,_m2_conditional_probability,"The General Multiplication Rule tells us how to find P(A and B) when A and B are not necessarily independent.We finished this module by introducing probability trees, visual displays of events that happen in sequence and that involve conditional probability, and used some examples to show how trees can be useful in solving practical probability problems."

_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In the previous section, we discussed discrete random variables: random variables whose possible values are a list of distinct numbers."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We talked about their probability distributions, means, and standard deviations."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We are now moving on to discuss continuous random variables: random variables which can take any value in an interval, so that all of their possible values cannot be listed (such as height, weight, temperature, time, etc.)"
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"As it turns out, most of the methods for dealing with continuous random variables require a higher mathematical level than we needed to deal with discrete random variables."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"For the most part, the calculation of probabilities associated with a continuous random variable, and its mean and standard deviation, requires knowledge of calculus, and is beyond the scope of this course."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"What we will do in this part is discuss the idea behind the probability distribution of a continuous random variable, and show how calculations involving such variables become quite complicated very fast!"
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,We'll then move on to a special class of continuous random variables—the normal random variables.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Normal random variables are very common, and play a very important role in statistical inference."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Now consider another random variable X = foot length of adult males.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Unlike shoe size, this variable is not limited to distinct, separate values, because foot lengths can take any value over a continuous range of possibilities, so we cannot present this variable with a probability histogram or a table."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,The probability distribution of foot length (or any other continuous random variable) can be represented by a smooth curve called a probability density curve.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Like the modified probability histogram above, the total area under the density curve equals 1, and the curve represents probabilities by area."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,The probability that X gets values in any interval is represented by the area above this interval and below the density curve.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In our foot length example, if our interval of interest is between 10 and 12 (marked in red below), and we would like to know P(10 < X < 12), the probability that a randomly chosen male has a foot length anywhere between 10 and 12 inches, we'll have to find the area above our interval of interest (10,12) and below our density curve, shaded in blue: If, for example, we are interested in P(X < 9), the probability that a randomly chosen male has a foot length of less than 9 inches, we'll have to find the area shaded in blue below: Comments We have seen that for a discrete random variable like shoe size, whether we have a strict inequality or not does matter when solving for probabilities."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In contrast, for a continuous random variable like foot length, the probability of a foot length of less than or equal to 9 will be the same as the probability of a foot length of strictly less than 9."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In other words, .P ( X < 9 ) = P ( X ≤ 9 ) Let's Summarize The probability distribution of a continuous random variable is represented by a probability density curve."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,The probability that X gets a value in any interval of interest is the area above this interval and below the density curve.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Now that we see how probabilities are found for continuous random variables, we understand why it is more complicated than finding probabilities in the discrete case."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"As anyone who has studied calculus can attest, finding the area under a curve can be difficult."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,The general approach is to use integrals.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"For those of you who did study calculus, the following should be familiar.... , where f(x) represents the density curve.P ( a ≤ X ≤ b ) = ( area between a and b and below the density curve ) = ∫ a b f ( x ) d x For those who did not study calculus, don't worry about it."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,This kind of calculation is definitely beyond the scope of this course.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In this course, we will encounter several important density curves—those for normal random variables, t random variables, chi-square random variables, and F random variables."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Normal and t distributions are bell-shaped (single-peaked and symmetric) like the density curve in the foot length example; chi-square and F distributions are single-peaked and skewed right, like in the figure above."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Rather than get bogged down in the calculus of solving for areas under curves, we will find probabilities for the above-mentioned random variables by consulting tables."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Also, statistical software automatically provides such probabilities in the appropriate context."

_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables," Probability Distribution When we learned how to find probabilities by applying the basic principles, we generally focused on just one particular outcome or event, like the probability of getting exactly one tail when a coin is tossed twice, or the probability of getting a 5 when a die is rolled."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Now that we have mastered the solution of individual probability problems, we'll proceed to look at the big picture by considering all the possible values of a discrete random variable, along with their associated probabilities."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,This list of possible values and probabilities is called the probability distribution of the random variable.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Comment In the Exploratory Data Analysis unit of this course, we often looked at the distribution of sample values in a quantitative data set."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We would display the values with a histogram, and summarize them by reporting their mean."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In this section, when we look at the probability distribution of a random variable, we consider all its possible values and their overall probabilities of occurrence."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Thus, we have in mind an entire population of values for a variable."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"When we display them with a histogram or summarize them with a mean, these are representing a population of values, not a sample."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"The distinction between sample and population is an essential concept in statistics, because an ultimate goal is to draw conclusions about unknown values for a population, based on what is observed in the sample."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Recall our first example, when we introduced the idea of a random variable."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,In this example we tossed a coin twice.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Flipping a Coin Twice What is the probability distribution of X, where the random variable X is the number of tails appearing in two tosses of a fair coin?"
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We first note that since the coin is fair, each of the four outcomes HH, HT, TH, TT in the sample space S is equally likely, and so each has a probability of 1/4."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"(Alternatively, the multiplication principle can be applied to find the probability of each outcome to be 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.)"
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"X takes the value 0 only for the outcome HH, so the probability that X = 0 is 1/4."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,X takes the value 1 for outcomes HT or TH.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"By the addition principle, the probability that X = 1 is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Finally, X takes the value 2 only for the outcome TT, so the probability that X = 2 is 1/4."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"The probability distribution of the random variable X is easily summarized in a table:As mentioned before, we write ""P(X = x)"" to denote ""the probability that the random variable X takes the value x."""
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"The way to interpret this table is: X takes the values 0, 1, 2 and P(X = 0) = 1/4, P(X = 1) = 1/2, P(X = 2) = 1/4."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Note that events of the type (X = x) are subject to the principles of probability established earlier, and will provide us with a way of systematically exploring the behavior of random variables."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In particular, the first two principles in the context of probability distributions of random variables will now be stated."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"When we learned how to find probabilities by applying the basic principles, we generally focused on just one particular outcome or event, like the probability of getting exactly one tail when a coin is tossed twice, or the probability of getting a 5 when a die is rolled."

_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In order to decide on some notation, let's look at the coin toss example again: A fair coin is tossed twice."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Let the random variable X be the number of tails we get in this random experiment.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In this case, the possible values that X can assume are 0 (if we get HH), 1 (if get HT or TH) , and 2 (if we get TT)."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Notation If we want to find the probability of the event ""getting 1 tail,"" we'll write: P(X = 1) If we want to find the probability of the event ""getting 0 tails,"" we'll write: P(X = 0) In general, we'll write: P(X = x) to denote the probability that the discrete random variable X gets the value x.Note that for the random variables we'll use a capital letter, and for the value we'll use a lowercase letter."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Section Plan The way this section on discrete random variables is organized is very similar to the way we organized our discussion about one quantitative variable in the Exploratory Data Analysis unit.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,It will be separated into four sections.

_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Introduction We first discussed variables in the Exploratory Data Analysis portion of the course.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,A variable is a characteristic of an individual.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We also made an important distinction between categorical variables, whose values are groups or categories (and an individual can be placed into one of them), and quantitative variables, which have numerical values for which arithmetic operations make sense."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In the previous two modules, we focused mostly on events which arise when there is a categorical variable in the background: blood type, pierced ears (yes/no), gender, on time delivery (yes/no), side effect (yes/no), etc."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Now we will begin to consider quantitative variables that arise when a random experiment is performed.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,We will need to define this new type of variable.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,random variable A random variable assigns a unique numerical value to the outcome of a random experiment.A random variable can be thought of as a function that associates exactly one of the possible numerical outcomes to each trial of a random experiment.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"However, that number can be the same for many of the trials."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Before we go any further, here are some simple examples: Theoretical Consider the random experiment of flipping a coin twice."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"The sample space of possible outcomes is S = { HH, HT, TH, TT }."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Now, let's define the variable X to be the number of tails that the random experiment will produce.If the outcome is HH, we have no tails, so the value for X is 0."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"If the outcome is HT, we got one tail, so the value for X is 1."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"If the outcome is TH, we again got one tail, so the value for X is 1."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"As the definition suggests, X is a quantitative variable that takes the possible values of 0, 1, or 2."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,It is random because we do not know which of the three values the variable will eventually take.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We can ask questions like: As you can see, random variables are not really a new thing, but just a different way to look at the same problem."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Note that if we had tossed a coin three times, the possible values for the number of tails would be 0, 1, 2, or 3."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In general, if we toss a coin ""n"" times, the possible number of tails would be 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , or n. Observational Consider getting data from a random sample on the number of ears in which a person wears one or more earrings."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We define the variable X to be the number of ears in which a randomly selected person wears an earring.If the selected person does not wear any earrings, then X = 0."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"If the selected person wears earrings in either the left or the right ear, then X = 1."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"If the selected person wears earrings in both ears, then X = 2."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"As the definition suggests, X is a quantitative variable which takes the possible values of 0, 1, or 2."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,We can ask questions like: What is the probability that a randomly selected person will have earrings in both ears?
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,What is the probability that a randomly selected person will not be wearing any earrings in either ear?
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,We identified the first example as theoretical and the second as observational.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Let's discuss the distinction.Here is a different type of example: Lightweight Boxer Assume we choose a lightweight male boxer at random and record his exact weight.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"According to the boxing rules, a lightweight male boxer must weigh between 130 and 135 pounds, so the sample space here is S = { All the numbers in the interval 130-135 }."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,(Note that we can't list all the possible outcomes here.)
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We'll define X to be the weight of the boxer (again, as the definition suggests, X is a quantitative variable whose value is the result of our random experiment)."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Here X can take any value between 130 and 135.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,We can ask questions like:What is the difference between the random variables in these examples?
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Let's see: Where they differ is in the type of possible values they can take: In the first two examples, X has three distinct possible values: 0, 1, and 2."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,You can list them.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In contrast, in the third example, X takes any value in the interval 130-135, and thus the possible values of X cover an infinite range of possibilities, and cannot be listed."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"A random variable like the one in the first two examples, whose possible values are a list of distinct values, is called a discrete random variable."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,We first discussed variables in the Exploratory Data Analysis portion of the course.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,A variable is a characteristic of an individual.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We also made an important distinction between categorical variables, whose values are groups or categories (and an individual can be placed into one of them), and quantitative variables, which have numerical values for which arithmetic operations make sense."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In the previous two modules, we focused mostly on events which arise when there is a categorical variable in the background: blood type, pierced ears (yes/no), gender, on time delivery (yes/no), side effect (yes/no), etc."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Now we will begin to consider quantitative variables that arise when a random experiment is performed.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables," Rules for Means and Variances of Random Variables So far we've learned how to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a random variable, and how to interpret these numerical measures."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Let's look at a motivating example that will show us what kinds of situations we may find these rules useful in.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Xavier's Production Line Assume that operating Xavier's production line costs $50 per hour, and that the repair cost of one defective part is $5."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"If X is the number of defective parts produced per hour, then the hourly cost would be 50 + 5X."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Note that since X is a random variable, so is the cost, 50 + 5X, and we might be interested in the mean and standard deviation of the hourly cost of operation for Xavier's production line."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"If we know the mean and standard deviation for the number of defective parts (X), is there an easy way to find the mean and standard deviation for the hourly cost (50 + 5X)?"
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,In General Sometimes a new random variable of interest arises when we take an existing random variable and multiply by a constant and/or add a constant to its values.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In the example above, we both multiplied X by 5 and added 50."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,We will return to the above example after exploring how such changes affect the center (mean) and spread (standard deviation) of random variables in general.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Consider the random variable X with a probability distribution as shown in the histogram below: It can easily be shown that X has a mean of 0, and a standard deviation of 1."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Adding a Constant to X What would the mean and standard deviation be if we shifted the entire histogram over 6 units to the right—in other words, what are the mean and standard deviation of X + 6?"
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We observe that shifting the distribution over to the right 6 units also shifts the center over 6 units: in other words, the mean of (X + 6) should equal the (mean of X) + 6."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"However, the spread of the distribution is unchanged: in other words, the standard deviation of (X + 6) should equal the standard deviation of X."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Again consider the random variable X with the probability distribution shown in the histogram below: Subtracting a Constant from X What would the mean and standard deviation be if we shifted the entire histogram over 7 units to the left—in other words, what are the mean and standard deviation of X - 7?"
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"The mean also shifts to the left by 7, from 0 to -7."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,The standard deviation remains unchanged at 1.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Multiplying X by a Constant That Is > 1 What would the mean and standard deviation be if we stretched the entire histogram by 4 units—in other words, what are the mean and standard deviation of 4X?"
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Multiplying X by 4 results in a mean that is 4 times the original mean.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In this case, the mean transforms from 0 to 4(0) = 0."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Multiplying X by 4 is tantamount to stretching the distribution by 4 units, and so the standard deviation will be 4 times the original standard deviation."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In other words, the mean of 4X is 4 times the mean of X; the standard deviation of 4X is 4 times the standard deviation of X."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"The variance, or squared standard deviation, would be 4 squared times the original variance; the variance of 4X is 16 times the variance of X. Multiplying X by a Constant That Is < 1 Finally, what would the mean and standard deviation be if we shrunk the entire histogram by a fourth—in other words, what are the mean and standard deviation of (1/4) X?"
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Dividing X by 4 results in a mean that is 1/4 the original mean.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In this case, the mean transforms from 0 to (1/4)(0) = 0."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Dividing X by 4 is tantamount to shrinking the distribution by 4 units, and so the standard deviation will be 1/4 of the original standard deviation."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In other words, the mean of (1/4)X is 1/4 times the mean of X; the standard deviation of (1/4)X is 1/4 times the standard deviation of X."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"So far we've learned how to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a random variable, and how to interpret these numerical measures."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Sometimes a new random variable of interest arises when we take an existing random variable and multiply by a constant and/or add a constant to its values.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In the example above, we both multiplied X by 5 and added 50."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,We will return to the above example after exploring how such changes affect the center (mean) and spread (standard deviation) of random variables in general.

_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We observe that shifting the distribution over to the right 6 units also shifts the center over 6 units: in other words, the mean of (X + 6) should equal the (mean of X) + 6."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"However, the spread of the distribution is unchanged: in other words, the standard deviation of (X + 6) should equal the standard deviation of X."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"What would the mean and standard deviation be if we shifted the entire histogram over 7 units to the left—in other words, what are the mean and standard deviation of X - 7?"
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"The mean also shifts to the left by 7, from 0 to -7."

_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In other words, the mean of 4X is 4 times the mean of X; the standard deviation of 4X is 4 times the standard deviation of X."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Finally, what would the mean and standard deviation be if we shrunk the entire histogram by a fourth—in other words, what are the mean and standard deviation of (1/4) X?"
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,Dividing X by 4 results in a mean that is 1/4 the original mean.

_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"In other words, the mean of (1/4)X is 1/4 times the mean of X; the standard deviation of (1/4)X is 1/4 times the standard deviation of X."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We have finally reached the end of this module, where we were introduced to the important concept of random variables, which are quantitative variables whose value is determined by the outcome of a random experiment.This module was organized into two parts: one dealing with discrete random variables, and the other dealing with continuous random variables."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,We saw that all the information about a discrete random variable is packed into its probability distribution.
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"Using that, we can answer probability questions about the random variable and find its mean and standard deviation."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We ended the part on discrete random variables by presenting a special class of discrete random variables—binomial random variables.As we dove into continuous random variables, we saw how calculations can get complicated very quickly, when probabilities associated with a continuous random variable are found by calculating areas under its density curve."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"As an example for a continuous random variable, we presented the normal random variable, and discussed it at length."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"The normal distribution is extremely important, not just because many variables in real life follow the normal distribution, but mainly because of the important role it plays in statistical inference, our ultimate goal of this course.We learned how we can avoid calculus by using the standard normal table to find probabilities associated with the normal distribution, and learned how it can be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution under certain conditions."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,"We are now ready to move on to the Sampling Distributions module of probability, which can be viewed in two ways."
_u4_probability,_m3_random_variables,On the one hand the Sampling Distributions module can be viewed as a special case of the Random Variables module since we are going to discuss two special random variables: the sample mean ( ) and the sample proportion ( X ¯ ).

_u4_probability,_m4_sampling_distributions, Introduction Already on several occasions we have pointed out the important distinction between a population and a sample.
_u4_probability,_m4_sampling_distributions,"In Exploratory Data Analysis, we learned to summarize and display values of a variable for a sample, such as displaying the blood types of 100 randomly chosen U.S. adults using a pie chart, or displaying the heights of 150 males using a histogram and supplementing it with the sample mean ( ) and sample standard deviation (S)."

_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,We will now shift our discussion to empirical ways to determine probabilities.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,A Question A single flip of a coin has an uncertain outcome.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"So, every time a coin is flipped, the outcome of that flip is unknown until the flip occurs."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"However, if you flip a fair coin over and over again, would you expect P(H) to be exactly 0.5?"
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"In other words, would you expect there to be the same number of results of ""heads"" as there are ""tails""?The following activity will allow you to discover the answer."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,The above Learn by Doing activity was our first example of the second way of determining probability: Empirical (Observational) methods.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"In the activity, we determined that the probability of getting the result ""heads"" is 0.5 by flipping a fair coin many, many times."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"A Second Question After doing this experiment, an important question naturally comes to mind."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,How would we know if the coin was not fair?
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"Certainly, classical probability methods would never be able to answer this question."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"In addition, classical methods could never tell us the actual P(H)."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,The only way to answer this question is to perform another experiment.The next activity will allow you to do just that.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"So, these types of experiments can verify classical probabilities and they can also determine when games of chance are not following fair practices."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"However, their real importance is to answer probability questions that arise when we are faced with a situation that does not follow any pattern and cannot be predetermined."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"In reality, most of the probabilities of interest to us fit the latter description."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,To Summarize 1.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,Probability is a way of quantifying uncertainty.2.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,We are interested in the probability of an event—the likelihood of the event occurring.3.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,The probability of an event ranges from 0 to 1.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"The closer the probability is to 0, the less likely the event is to occur."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"The closer the probability is to 1, the more likely the event is to occur.4."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,There are two ways to determine probability: Theoretical (Classical) and Empirical (Observational).5.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,Theoretical methods use the nature of the situation to determine probabilities.6.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,A single flip of a coin has an uncertain outcome.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"So, every time a coin is flipped, the outcome of that flip is unknown until the flip occurs."

_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,There are two ways to determine probability: Theoretical (Classical) and Empirical (Observational).5.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,Theoretical methods use the nature of the situation to determine probabilities.6.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"Recall the Big Picture—the four-step process that encompasses statistics (as it is presented in this course): So far, we've discussed the first two steps: Producing data—how data are obtained and what considerations affect the data production process."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"Exploratory data analysis—tools that help us get a first feel for the data, by exposing their features using graphs and numbers."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"(Recall that the structure of this course is such that exploratory data analysis was covered first, followed by producing data.)"
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,Our eventual goal is inference—drawing reliable conclusions about the population based on what we've discovered in our sample.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"In order to really understand how inference works, though, we first need to talk about probability, because it is the underlying foundation for the methods of statistical inference."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"We use an example to explain why probability is so essential to inference.First, here is the general idea: As we all know, the way statistics works is that we use a sample to learn about the population from which it was drawn."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"Ideally, the sample should be random so that it represents the population well."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"Recall from the Sampling module that when we say a random sample represents the population well, we mean that there is no inherent bias in this sampling technique."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"It is important to acknowledge, though, that this does not mean that all random samples are necessarily “perfect.” Random samples are still random, and therefore no random sample will be exactly the same as another."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"One random sample may give a fairly accurate representation of the population, while another random sample might be “off,” purely due to chance."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"Unfortunately, when looking at a particular sample (which is what happens in practice), we will never know how much it differs from the population."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,This uncertainty is where probability comes into the picture.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,We use probability to quantify how much we expect random samples to vary.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,This gives us a way to draw conclusions about the population in the face of the uncertainty that is generated by the use of a random sample.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,The following example will illustrate this important point.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,Death Penalty Suppose that we are interested in estimating the percentage of U.S. adults who favor the death penalty.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"In order to do so, we choose a random sample of 1,200 U.S. adults and ask their opinion: either in favor of or against the death penalty."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"We find that 744 out of the 1,200, or 62%, are in favor."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"(Comment: although this is only an example, this figure of 62% is quite realistic, given some recent polls)."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"Here is a picture that illustrates what we have done and found in our example: Our goal here is to do inference—learn and draw conclusions about the opinions of the entire population of U.S. adults regarding the death penalty, based on the opinions of only 1,200 of them."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,Can we conclude that 62% of the population favors the death penalty?
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,Another random sample could give a very different result.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,So we are uncertain.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"But since our sample is random, we know that our uncertainty is due to chance, and not due to problems with how the sample was collected."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,So we can use probability to describe the likelihood that our sample is within a desired level of accuracy.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"For example, probability can answer the question, ""How likely is it that our sample estimate is no more than 3% from the true percentage of all U.S. adults who are in favor of the death penalty?” The answer to this question (which we find using probability) is obviously going to have an important impact on the confidence we can attach to the inference step."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"So, we've seen how the relative frequency idea works, and hopefully the activities have convinced you that the relative frequency of an event does indeed approach the theoretical probability of that event as the number of repetitions increases."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"This is called the Law of Large Numbers.The Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of trials increases, the relative frequency becomes the actual probability."

_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,General Remarks Random Variables A random variable is a variable whose values are numerical results of a random experiment.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,A discrete random variable is summarized by its probability distribution -- a list of its possible values and their corresponding probabilities.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,The probability distribution of a random variable can be supplemented by numerical measures of center and spread of the random variable.Center: The center of a random variable is measured by its mean.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,-- The mean of a random variable can be interpreted as its long run average.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,-- The mean is a weighted average of the possible values of the random variable weighted by their corresponding probabilities.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"Spread: The spread of a random variable is measured by its variance, or more typically by its standard deviation (the square root of the variance)."
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,Continuous Random Variables The probability distribution of a continuous random variable is represented by a probability density curve.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,The probability that the random variable takes a value in any interval of interest is the area above this interval and below the density curve.
_u4_probability,x-oli-workbook_page,"An important example of a continuous random variable is the normal random variable, whose probability density curve is symmetric (bell-shaped), bulging in the middle and tapering at the ends."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable," Overview As we mentioned in the introduction to interval estimation, we start by discussing interval estimation for the population mean μ."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Here is a quick overview of how we introduce this topic.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Learn how a 95% confidence interval for the population mean μ is constructed and interpreted.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Generalize to confidence intervals with other levels of confidence (for example, what if we want a 99% confidence interval?)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Understand more broadly the structure of a confidence interval and the importance of the margin of error.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Understand how the precision of interval estimation is affected by the confidence level and sample size.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Learn under which conditions we can safely use the methods that are introduced in this section.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Recall the IQ example: Suppose that we are interested in studying the IQ levels of students at Smart University (SU).
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In particular (since IQ level is a quantitative variable), we are interested in estimating μ, the mean IQ level of all the students at SU."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"We will assume that from past research on IQ scores in different universities, it is known that the IQ standard deviation in such populations is ."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In order to estimate μ , a random sample of 100 SU students was chosen, and their (sample) mean IQ level is calculated (let's not assume, for now, that the value of this sample mean is 115, as before)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"σ = 15 * We learned in the ""Sampling Distributions"" module of probability that according to the central limit theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal with a mean of μ and standard deviation of X ¯ ."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In our example, then, (where σ n and n=100), the possible values of σ = 15 , the sample mean IQ level of 100 randomly chosen students, is approximately normal, with mean μ and standard deviation X ¯ ."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,15 100 = 1 .
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"5 * Next, we recall and apply the Standard Deviation Rule for the normal distribution, and in particular its second part: There is a 95% chance that the sample mean we get in our sample falls within 2 * 1.5 = 3 of μ."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"* Obviously, if there is a certain distance between the sample mean and the population mean, we can describe that distance by starting at either value."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"So, if the sample mean ( ) falls within a certain distance of the population mean μ, then the population mean μ falls within the same distance of the sample mean."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"x ¯ Therefore, the statement, ""There is a 95% chance that the sample mean falls within 3 units of μ"" can be rephrased as: ""We are 95% x ¯ confident that the population mean μ falls within 3 units of ."""
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"x ¯ So, if we happen to get a sample mean of , then we are 95% sure that μ falls within 3 of 115, or in other words that μ is covered by the interval (115 - 3, 115 + 3) = (112,118)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"x ¯ = 115 (On later pages, we will use similar reasoning to develop a general formula for a confidence interval.)"
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Comment Note that the first phrasing is about , which is a random variable; that's why it makes sense to use probability language."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"But the second phrasing is about μ, which is a parameter, and thus is a ""fixed"" value that doesn’t change, and that's why we shouldn’t use probability language to discuss it."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable," Let's summarize * When the population is normal and/or the sample is large, a confidence interval for unknown population mean μ when σ is known is: , where z* is 1.645 for 90% confidence, 2 for 95% confidence, and 2.576 for 99% confidence."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The purpose of this section is to gradually build your understanding about how statistical hypothesis testing works.

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"To strengthen your understanding of the process of hypothesis testing and the logic behind it, let's look at three statistical examples."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,1 A recent study estimated that 20% of all college students in the United States smoke.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The head of Health Services at Goodheart University suspects that the proportion of smokers may be lower there.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In hopes of confirming her claim, the head of Health Services chooses a random sample of 400 Goodheart students, and finds that 70 of them are smokers."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Let's analyze this example using the 4 steps outlined above: Stating the claims: There are two claims here: claim 1: The proportion of smokers at Goodheart is .20.claim 2: The proportion of smokers at Goodheart is less than .20.A sample of n = 400 was chosen, and summarizing the data revealed that the sample proportion of smokers is ."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"175 In other words, we need to find how likely it is that in a random sample of size n = 400 taken from a population where the proportion of smokers is p = .20 we'll get a sample proportion as low as (or lower)."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Now you have to decide ... Do you think that a probability of .106 makes our data rare enough (surprising enough) under claim 1 so that the fact that we did observe it is enough evidence to reject claim 1?

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,p ˆ = 70 400 = .
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"175 Assessment of evidence: In order to assess whether the data provide strong enough evidence against claim 1, we need to ask ourselves: How surprising is it to get a sample proportion as low as (or lower), assuming claim 1 is true?"
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,p ˆ = .
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"175 In other words, we need to find how likely it is that in a random sample of size n = 400 taken from a population where the proportion of smokers is p = .20 we'll get a sample proportion as low as (or lower)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,p ˆ = .
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,175 (or lower) in such a sample is roughly .106 (do not worry about how this was calculated at this point).

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"175 Well, we found that if claim 1 were true there is a probability of .106 of observing data like that observed."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Now you have to decide ... Do you think that a probability of .106 makes our data rare enough (surprising enough) under claim 1 so that the fact that we did observe it is enough evidence to reject claim 1?
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Point estimation is simple and intuitive, but also a bit problematic."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Here is why: When we estimate, say, μ by the sample mean , we are almost guaranteed to make some kind of error."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Even though we know that the values of x ¯ fall around μ, it is very unlikely that the value of x ¯ will fall exactly at μ ."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"x ¯ Given that such errors are a fact of life for point estimates (by the mere fact that we are basing our estimate on one sample that is a small fraction of the population), these estimates are in themselves of limited usefulness, unless we are able to quantify the extent of the estimation error."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Interval estimation addresses this issue.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"The idea behind interval estimation is, therefore, to enhance the simple point estimates by supplying information about the size of the error attached.In this introduction, we'll provide examples that will give you a solid intuition about the basic idea behind interval estimation."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Consider the example that we discussed in the point estimation section: Suppose that we are interested in studying the IQ levels of students in a Smart University (SU).
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In particular (since IQ level is a quantitative variable), we are interested in estimating μ, the mean IQ level of all the students in SU."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"A random sample of 100 SU students was chosen, and their (sample) mean IQ level was found to be ."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,x ¯ = 115 .
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,In point estimation we used as the point estimate for μ.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"However, we had no idea of what the estimation error involved in such an estimation might be."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Interval estimation takes point estimation a step further and says something like: x ¯ = 115 ""I am 95% confident that by using the point estimate to estimate μ, I am off by no more than 3 IQ points."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In other words, I am 95% confident that μ is within 3 of 115, or between 112 (115 - 3) and 118 (115 + 3)."""
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"x ¯ = 115 Yet another way to say the same thing is: I am 95% confident that μ is somewhere in (or covered by) the interval (112,118)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"( Comment: At this point you should not worry about, or try to figure out, how we got these numbers."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,We'll do that later.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,All we want to do here is make sure you understand the idea.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,")Note that while point estimation provided just one number as an estimate for μ (115), interval estimation provides a whole interval of ""plausible values"" for μ (between 112 and 118), and also attaches the level of our confidence that this interval indeed includes the value of μ to our estimation (in our example, 95% confidence)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"The interval (112,118) is therefore called ""a 95% confidence interval for μ."""
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Let's look at another example: Let's consider the second example from the point estimation section.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Suppose that we are interested in the opinions of U.S. adults regarding legalizing the use of marijuana.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In particular, we are interested in the parameter p, the proportion of U.S. adults who believe marijuana should be legalized."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Suppose a poll of 1,000 U.S. adults finds that 560 of them believe marijuana should be legalized."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"If we wanted to estimate p, the population proportion, by a single number based on the sample, it would make intuitive sense to use the corresponding quantity in the sample, the sample proportion ."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,p ˆ = 560 1000 = .
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"56 Interval estimation would take this a step further and say something like: ""I am 90% sure that by using .56 to estimate the true population proportion, p, I am off by (or, I have an error of) no more than .03 (or 3 percentage points)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In other words, I am 90% confident that the actual value of p is somewhere between .53 (.56 - .03) and .59 (.56 + .03)."""
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Yet another way of saying this is: ""I am 90% confident that p is covered by the interval (.53, .59)."""
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In this example, (.53, .59) is a 90% confidence interval for p. Let's summarize The two examples showed us that the idea behind interval estimation is, instead of providing just one number for estimating an unknown parameter of interest, to provide an interval of plausible values of the parameter plus a level of confidence that the value of the parameter is covered by this interval."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,We are now going to go into more detail and learn how these confidence intervals are created.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"As you'll see, the ideas that were developed in the ""Sampling Distributions"" module of the Probability unit will, again, be very important (as they were in point estimation)."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"As we mentioned at the end of the introduction, the first part of the inference unit will deal with inference for one variable."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Recall that in the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) unit, when we learned about summarizing the data obtained from one variable (in the Examining Distributions module) we distinguished between two cases; categorical data and quantitative data."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,We will make a similar distinction here in the inference unit.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In the EDA unit, the type of variable determined the displays and numerical measures we used to summarize the data."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In Inference, the type of variable of interest (categorical or quantitative) will determine what population parameter we are going to do inference for."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"* When the variable of interest is categorical, the population parameter that we will infer about is the population proportion (p) associated with that variable."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"For example, if we are interested in studying opinions about the death penalty among U.S. adults, and thus our variable of interest is ""death penalty (in favor/against),"" we'll choose a sample of U.S. adults and use the collected data to make an inference about p—the proportion of U.S. adults who support the death penalty."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"* When the variable of interest is quantitative, the population parameter that we infer about is the population mean (μ) associated with that variable."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,single value (hence the name point estimation).
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"As the following two examples illustrate, this form of inference is quite intuitive.point estimate for μ, and in general, we'll always use point estimator for μ."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"(Note that when we talk about the specific value (115), we use the term estimate, and when we talk in general about the estimator."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable," Overview So far we have talked about the logic behind hypothesis testing and then illustrated how this process proceeds in practice, using the z-test for the population proportion (p)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"We are now moving on to discuss testing for the population mean (μ), in which is the parameter of interest when the variable of interest is quantitative."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Two comments about the structure of this section: 1.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"The basic groundwork for carrying out hypothesis tests has already been laid in the unit on tests about proportions, and therefore we can easily modify the four steps to carry out tests about means instead, without going into all the little details."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,2.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"This unit will have two parts, as we need to distinguish between cases; the case where the population standard deviation (σ) is known, and the case where σ is unknown."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In the first case (σ known), the test is called the z-test for the population mean μ.In the second case (σ unknown), the test is called the t-test for the population mean μ."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The reason for the different names (z vs. t) is for exactly the same reason that the test for the proportion (p) is called a z-test.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In the first case, the test statistic will have a standard normal (z) distribution (when H o is true), and in the second case, the test statistic will have a t-distribution (when Ho is true).Let's start."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Tests about μ when sigma (σ) is known—The z-test for the population mean In this section, we will proceed under the assumption that the population standard deviation (σ) is known."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,We've already discussed the practicality of this assumption.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In most situations, the population standard deviation is not known, but in some cases, especially when the variables of interest have been investigated thoroughly over the years, it would make sense to assume that σ is known."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Such variables are, for example, IQs and other standardized test scores, or heights, weights, and other physical characteristics."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,We'll start by introducing two examples that will be our leading examples for this part.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,1 The SAT is constructed so that scores in each portion have a national average of 500 and standard deviation of 100.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The distribution is close to normal.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The dean of students of Ross College suspects that in recent years the college attracts students who are more quantitatively inclined.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,A random sample of 4 students from a recent entering class at Ross College had an average math SAT (SAT-M) score of 550.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Does this provide enough evidence for the dean to conclude that the mean SAT-M of all Ross college students is higher than the national mean of 500?
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Assume that the standard deviation of 100 applies also to all Ross College students.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Comment: This is a situation where it is quite reasonable to assume that the population standard deviation (σ) is known.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"SAT tests are constructed so that the standard deviation is 100, and provided that there is nothing special about students at Ross college, we can assume that in the population of Ross college students."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,σ = 100 Here is a figure that represents this example: 2 A certain prescription medicine is supposed to contain an average of 250 parts per million (ppm) of a certain chemical.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"If the concentration is higher than this, the drug may cause harmful side effects; if it is lower, the drug may be ineffective."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The manufacturer runs a check to see if the mean concentration in a large shipment conforms to the target level of 250 ppm or not.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"A simple random sample of 100 portions is tested, and the sample mean concentration is found to be 247 ppm."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,It is assumed that the concentration standard deviation in the entire shipment is ppm.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,σ = 12 Comment: Here it is not that clear why the assumption that σ is known to be 12 is reasonable.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"If shipments are checked on a regular basis, then maybe past experience has shown that indeed ."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In any case, we will come back to this problem and discuss this point again later."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In other words, how likely is it that the only reason for getting data like those observed is sampling variability (and not because Ho is not true)?"

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable, 3.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Finding the p-value of the test The p-value — the probability of getting data (summarized with the test statistic) as extreme as those observed or even more extreme (in the direction of the alternative hypothesis) when H o is true — for the z-test for the population mean is found exactly like the p-value in the z-test for the population proportion.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"We've already learned that the p-value is found under the null distribution of the test statistic, and since for both means (with σ known) and proportions the null distribution of the test statistic is N(0,1), the p-value is calculated as follows: Less Than Greater Than Not Equal To 1 In the example about the SAT-M scores of students at Ross College, the test statistic was found to be z = 1."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"The p-value is therefore P(Z > 1): To find the p-value, we can either: use the (68% part of the) Standard Deviation Rule for the normal distribution, which tells us that the p-value is approximately 0.16 (since P(-1 < Z < 1) = 0.68), or use the normal table, or carry out the test using statistical software."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In this case, we get a p-value of 0.159."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"2 In the concentration level example, the test statistic was found to be -2.5."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Since this is the two-sided test, the p-value is the combination of the two shaded areas in the following figure."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The p-value is therefore twice P(Z > 2.5).
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"We can either use the table, or carry out the test using statistical software."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable, The p-value — the probability of getting data (summarized with the test statistic) as extreme as those observed or even more extreme (in the direction of the alternative hypothesis) when H o is true — for the z-test for the population mean is found exactly like the p-value in the z-test for the population proportion.

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"So far, we've discussed the first three steps in the hypothesis testing process of the z-test for the population mean (μ)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The last step is to draw conclusions.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,4.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Drawing Conclusions Here we assess the significance of the results (based on the p-value compared with some significance level of choice), and state our conclusions in context."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,1 Here the p-value is quite large (.16) which means that it is not very surprising to get data like those observed when H o is true.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"The results are therefore not significant, and so we do not have enough evidence to reject Ho and conclude that the mean SAT-M of all Ross College students is higher than the national mean (500)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Note that even though the average SAT-M in our sample was 550 (which is substantially larger than 500), since this result was based on a sample of only 4 students, it does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the mean SAT-M is higher than 500."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,We'll further explore this point in the next activity.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Here is the completed figure representing the hypothesis testing process for this example: 2 In this example, the p-value is quite small (.012)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In particular, for a significance level of .05, the p-value indicates that the results are significant."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The data provide enough evidence for us to reject H o and conclude that the mean concentration level in the shipment is not the required 250 ppm.

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The data provide enough evidence for us to reject H o and conclude that the mean concentration level in the shipment is not the required 250 ppm.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Recall that we were discussing the situation of testing for a mean, in the case when sigma is unknown."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"We’ve seen previously that when sigma is known, the test statistic is (note the sigma (σ) in the formula), which follows a normal distribution."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"But when sigma is z = x ¯ − μ 0 σ n unknown, the test statistic in the test for a mean becomes (note the use of ""s"" in the formula, in place of the unknown sigma)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"t = x ¯ − μ 0 s n Here is where the t-distribution arises in the context of a test for a mean, because (with ""s"" in the formula in place of the unknown sigma) follows a t distribution."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"t = x ¯ − μ 0 s n Notice the only difference between the formula for the Z statistic and the formula for the t statistic: In the formula for the Z statistic, sigma (the standard deviation of the population) must be known; whereas, when sigma isn’t known, then ""s"" (the standard deviation of the sample data) is used in place of the unknown sigma."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,That’s the change that causes the statistic to be a t statistic.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Why would this single change (using ""s"" in place of ""sigma"") result in a sampling distribution that is the t distribution instead of the standard normal (Z) distribution?"
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Remember that the t distribution is more appropriate in cases where there is more variability.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,So why is there more variability when s is used in place of the unknown sigma?
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Well, remember that sigma (σ) is a parameter (it’s the standard deviation of the population), whose value therefore never changes."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Whereas, s (the standard deviation of the sample data) varies from sample to sample, and therefore it’s another source of variation."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"So, using s in place of sigma causes the sampling distribution to be the t distribution because of that extra source of variation: In the formula , the only source of variation is the sampling variability of the sample mean z = x ¯ − μ 0 σ n (none of the other terms in that formula vary randomly in a given study); X ¯ Whereas in the formula , there are t = x ¯ − μ 0 s n two sources of variation: One source is the sampling variability of the sample mean ; The X ¯ other source is the sampling variability of sample standard deviation s. So, in a test for a mean, if sigma isn’t known, then s is used in place of the unknown sigma and that results in the test statistic being a t score."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"The t score, in the context of a test for a mean, is summarized by the following figure: In fact, the t score that arises in the context of a test for a mean is a t score with (n – 1) degrees of freedom."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Recall that each t distribution is indexed according to ""degrees of freedom."""
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Notice that, in the context of a test for a mean, the degrees of freedom depend on the sample size in the study."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,Remember that we said that higher degrees of freedom indicate that the t distribution is closer to normal.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"So in the context of a test for the mean, the larger the sample size, the higher the degrees of freedom, and the closer the t distribution is to a normal z distribution."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"This is summarized with the notation near the bottom on the following image: As a result, in the context of a test for a mean, the effect of the t distribution is most important for a study with a relatively small sample size."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,We are now done introducing the t distribution.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,What are implications of all of this?
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,1.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,The null distribution of our t-test statistic: is the t distribution with (n-1) d.f.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In other words, when H t = x ¯ − μ 0 s n o is true (i.e., when ), our test statistic has a t distribution with (n-1) d.f., and this is the distribution under which we find p-values."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"For a large sample size (n), the null distribution of the test statistic is approximately Z, so whether we use t(n - 1) or Z to calculate the p-values should not make a big difference."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"If we have a large n, our sample has more information about the population."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Finding the p-value The p-value of the t-test is found exactly the same way as it is found for the z-test, except that the t distribution is used instead of the Z distribution, as the figures below illustrate."

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,To summarize: The main difference between the z-test and the t-test for the population mean is that we use the sample standard deviation s instead of the unknown population standard deviation σ.

_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"It is important to remember to take into consideration the possibility of the occurrence of Type I or Type II error, when drawing conclusions from hypothesis tests."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Thus: Whenever there is a failure to reject the null hypothesis, it is possible that a Type II error has occurred."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Thus, it is concluded from the results of the study, that there are no significant differences, even though, in reality, there are significant differences."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Whenever the null hypothesis is rejected, it is possible that a Type I error has been committed."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"That is, it is concluded from the results of the study, that there are significant differences, when, in reality, there are no differences."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"However, it is not possible to know when either Type I or Type II error has occurred."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable," Since the margin of error is , isn't it true that another way to reduce the margin of error (for a fixed z*) is to reduce σ?"
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"z * ⋅ σ n While it is true that strictly mathematically speaking the smaller the value of σ, the smaller the margin of error, practically speaking we have absolutely no control over the value of σ (i.e., we cannot make it larger or smaller)."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable," Many students wonder why 5% is often selected as the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why 1% is the next most typical level."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,This is largely due to just convenience and tradition.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"When Ronald Fisher (one of the founders of modern statistics) published one of his tables, he used a mathematically convenient scale that included 5% and 1%."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"Later, these same 5% and 1% levels were used by other people, in part just because Fisher was so highly esteemed."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,But mostly these are arbitrary levels.
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"The idea of selecting some sort of relatively small cutoff was historically important in the development of statistics; but it’s important to remember that there is really a continuous range of increasing confidence towards the alternative hypothesis, not a single all-or-nothing value."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"There isn’t much meaningful difference, for instance, between a p-value of .049 or .051, and it would be foolish to declare one case definitely a ""real"" effect and to declare the other case definitely a ""random"" effect."
_u5_inference,_m1_inference_one_variable,"In either case, the study results were roughly 5% likely by chance if there’s no actual effect."

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships," Comparing More Than Two Means—ANOVA Overview In this part, we continue to handle situations involving one categorical explanatory variable and one quantitative response variable, which is case C→Q in our role/type classification table: So far we have discussed the two samples and matched pairs designs, in which the categorical explanatory variable is two-valued."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"As we saw, in these cases, examining the relationship between the explanatory and the response variables amounts to comparing the mean of the response variable (Y) in two populations, which are defined by the two values of the explanatory variable (X)."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"The difference between the two samples and matched pairs designs is that in the former, the two samples are independent, and in the latter, the samples are dependent."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,We are now moving on to cases in which the categorical explanatory variable takes more than two values.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Here, as in the two-valued case, making inferences about the relationship between the explanatory (X) and the response (Y) variables amounts to comparing the means of the response variable in the populations defined by the values of the explanatory variable, where the number of means we are comparing depends, of course, on the number of values of X."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Unlike the two-valued case, where we looked at two sub-cases (1) when the samples are independent (two samples design) and (2) when the samples are dependent (matched pairs design, here, we are just going to discuss the case where the samples are independent."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In other words, we are just going to extend the two samples design to more than two independent samples."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Comment The inferential method for comparing more than two means that we will introduce in this part is called Analysis Of Variance (abbreviated as ANOVA), and the test associated with this method is called the ANOVA F-test."

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,A college dean believes that students with different majors may experience different levels of academic frustration.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Random samples of size 35 of Business, English, Mathematics, and Psychology majors are asked to rate their level of academic frustration on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 20 (highest)."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,The figure highlights what we have already mentioned: examining the relationship between major (X) and frustration level (Y) amounts to comparing the mean frustration levels ( ) among the four majors defined by X.

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"μ 1 , μ 2 , μ 3 , μ 4 Comment There are two ways to record data in the ANOVA setting: Unstacked: One column for each of the four majors, with each column listing the frustration levels reported by all sampled students in that major: Business English Math Psychology 11 11 9 11 6 9 16 19 6 14 11 13 etc."

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Before we give you hands-on practice in carrying out the ANOVA F-test, let's look at another example: Do advertisers alter the reading level of their ads based on the target audience of the magazine they advertise in?"
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In 1981, a study of magazine advertisements was conducted (F.K."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Shuptrine and D.D.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"McVicker, ""Readability Levels of Magazine Ads,"" Journal of Advertising Research, 21:5, October 1981)."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Researchers selected random samples of advertisements from each of three groups of magazines: Group 1—highest educational level magazines (such as Scientific American, Fortune, The New Yorker) Group 2—middle educational level magazines (such as Sports Illustrated, Newsweek, People) Group 3—lowest educational level magazines (such as National Enquirer, Grit, True Confessions) The measure that the researchers used to assess the level of the ads was the number of words in the ad."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"18 ads were randomly selected from each of the magazine groups, and the number of words per ad were recorded."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,The following figure summarizes this problem: Our question of interest is whether the number of words in ads (Y) is related to the educational level of the magazine (X).
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"To answer this question, we need to compare , the mean number of words in ads of the three magazine groups."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Note in the figure that the sample means are provided.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"It seems that what the data suggest makes sense; the magazines in group 1 have the largest number of words per ad (on average) followed by group 2, and then group 3. μ 1 , μ 2 , μ 3 The question is whether these differences between the sample means are significant."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In other words, are the differences among the observed sample means due to true differences among the μ's or merely due to sampling variability?"
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"To answer this question, we need to carry out the ANOVA F-test."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Step 1: Stating the hypotheses.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"We are testing: Conceptually, the null hypothesis claims that the number of words in ads is not related to the educational level of the magazine, and the alternative hypothesis claims that there is a relationship."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Step 2: Checking conditions and summarizing the data.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"(i) The ads were selected at random from each magazine group, so the three samples are independent."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In order to check the next two conditions, we'll need to look at the data (condition ii), and calculate the sample standard deviations of the three samples (condition iii)."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Here are the side-by-side boxplots of the data, followed by the standard deviations: (ii) The graph does not display any alarming violations of the normality assumption."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"It seems like there is some skewness in groups 2 and 3, but not extremely so, and there are no outliers in the data."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"(iii) We can assume that the equal standard deviation assumption is met since the rule of thumb is satisfied: the largest sample standard deviation of the three is 74 (group 1), the smallest one is 57.6 (group 3), and 74/57.6 < 2."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Before we move on, let's look again at the graph."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,It is easy to see the trend of the sample means (indicated by red circles).
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"However, there is so much variation within each of the groups that there is almost a complete overlap between the three boxplots, and the differences between the means are over-shadowed and seem like something that could have happened just by chance."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Let's move on and see whether the ANOVA F-test will support this observation.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Using statistical software to conduct the ANOVA F-test, we find that the F statistic is 1.18, which is not very large."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,We also find that the p-value is 0.317.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Step 3.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Finding the p-value.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"The p-value is 0.317, which tells us that getting data like those observed is not very surprising assuming that there are no differences between the three magazine groups with respect to the mean number of words in ads (which is what H o claims).In other words, the large p-value tells us that it is quite reasonable that the differences between the observed sample means could have happened just by chance (i.e., due to sampling variability) and not because of true differences between the means."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Step 4: Making conclusions in context.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"The large p-value indicates that the results are not significant, and that we cannot reject H o.We therefore conclude that the study does not provide evidence that the mean number of words in ads is related to the educational level of the magazine."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"X : year in college (1 = freshmen, 2 = sophomore, 3 = junior, 4 = senior) andY : GPA4 sub-populations: freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Within each of these four groups, we are interested in the GPA.1 : mean GPA among freshmen in the United States.2 : mean GPA among sophomores in the United States 3 : mean GPA among juniors in the United States4 : mean GPA among seniors in the United Statesk = 2 (since gender has only two categories: M, F), and the inference will boil down to comparing the mean GPA in the sub-population of males to that in the sub-population of females."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"On the other hand, in the example we looked at earlier, the relationship between GPA (Y) and year (X) is a case where k > 2 or more specifically, k = 4 (since year has four categories)."

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,This section will be organized around a leading example.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"So far, the researchers have observed linearity in the data, and based on a test concluded that this linear relationship between age and legibility distance can be generalized to the entire population of drivers."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Since that is the case, the researchers would now like to estimate the equation of the straight line that governs the linear relationship between age and legibility distance among drivers."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"As we commented earlier, this is done by finding the line that best fits the pattern of our observed data."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Recall that this line is called the least squares regression line, which is the line that minimizes the sum of the squared vertical deviations: In the Exploratory Data Analysis section, we presented the actual formulas for the slope and intercept of the line."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,We are not going to repeat those here; we will obtain those values from the output: and ask the software to plot it for us on the scatterplot so we can see how well it fits the data.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Based on the observed data, the researchers conclude that the linear relationship between age and legibility distance among drivers can be summarized with the line: DISTANCE = 576.7 - 3.007 * AGE In particular, the slope of the line is roughly -3, which means that for every year that a driver gets older (1 unit increase in X), the maximum legibility distance is reduced, on average, by 3 feet (Y changes by the value of the slope)."

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"For example, using the equation of the line, we predict that the maximum legibility distance of a 60-year-old driver is: distance = 576.7 - 3.007(60) = 396.28."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,The following figure illustrates this prediction.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Let's Summarize Let's summarize in a figure all that the researchers have done: In the t-test for the significance of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables X and Y, we are testing H o: No linear relationship exists between X and Y. H a: A linear relationship exists between X and Y.The test assesses the strength of evidence provided by the data (as seen in the scatterplot and measured by the correlation r) and reports a p-value."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"The p-value is the probability of getting data such as that observed assuming that, in reality, no linear relationship exists between X and Y in the population."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Based on the p-value, we draw our conclusions."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,A small p-value will indicate that we reject H o and conclude that the data provide enough evidence of a real linear relationship between X and Y in the population.

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"So far the researchers have observed linearity in the data, and based on a test concluded that this linear relationship between age and legibility distance can be generalized to the entire population of drivers."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Since that is the case, the researchers would now like to estimate the equation of the straight line that governs the linear relationship between age and legibility distance among drivers."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"As we commented earlier, this is done by finding the line that best fits the pattern of our observed data."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Recall that this line is called the least squares regression line, which is the line that minimizes the sum of the squared vertical deviations: In the Exploratory Data Analysis section, we presented the actual formulas for the slope and intercept of the line."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"We are not going to repeat those here, we will obtain those values from the output: and ask the software to plot it for us on the scatterplot so we can see how well it fits the data."

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,chi-square test for independence.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,here.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Let's look at another example.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Steroid Use in Sports Major-league baseball star Barry Bonds admitted to using a steroid cream during the 2003 season.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Is steroid use different in baseball than in other sports?
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"According to the 2001 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) survey (http://www.ncaa.org/library/research/substance_use_habits/2001/substance_use_habits.pdf), which is self-reported and asked of a stratified random selection of teams from each of the three NCAA divisions, reported steroid use among the top 5 college sports was as follows: Do the data provide evidence of a significant relationship between steroid use and the type of sport?"
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In other words, are there significant differences in steroid use among the different sports?"
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Before we carry out the chi-square test for independence, let's get a sense of the data by calculating the conditional percents: It seems as if there are differences in steroid use among the different sports."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Even though the differences do not seem to be overwhelming, since the sample size is so large, these differences might be significant."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Let's carry out the test and see.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Step 1: Stating the hypotheses The hypotheses are: H steroid use is not related to the type of sport (or: type of sport and steroid use are independent)o: H Steroid use is related to the type of sport (or: type of sport and steroid use are not independent).a: Step 2: Checking conditions and finding the test statistic Here is the Minitab output of the chi-square test for this example: Conditions: Test statistic: Step 3: Finding the p-value According to the output p-value it would be extremely unlikely (probability of 0.006) to get counts like those observed if the null hypothesis were true.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In other words, it would be very surprising to get data like those observed if steroid use were not related to sport type."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Step 4: Conclusion The small p-value indicates that the data provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so we reject it and conclude that the steroid use is related to the type of sport."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Let's Summarize The hypotheses that are being tested in the chi-square test for independence are: o: There is no relationship between ... and .... a: There is a relationship between ... and .... o: The variables ... and ... are independent.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships, The hypotheses that are being tested in the chi-square test for independence are: o: There is no relationship between ... and .... a: There is a relationship between ... and .... o: The variables ... and ... are independent.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,In the previous two modules we performed inference for one variable.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"More specifically, we learned about inference for the population proportion p (when the variable of interest is categorical) and inference for the population mean μ (when the variable of interest is quantitative)."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,In the previous two modules we were also exposed to the following three forms of inference which will continue to be central as we move forward in the course: Point estimation—estimating an unknown parameter with a single value that is computed from the sample.Interval estimation—estimating an unknown parameter by an interval of plausible values.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,To each such interval we attach a level of confidence that indeed the interval captures the value of the unknown parameter and hence the name confidence intervals.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Hypothesis testing—a four-step process in which we are assessing evidence provided by the data in favor or against some claim about the population parameter.Our next (and final) goal for this course is to perform inference about relationships between two variables in a population, based on an observed relationship between variables in a sample."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Here is what the process looks like: We are interested in studying whether a relationship exists between the variables X and Y in a population of interest.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,We choose a random sample and collect data on both variables from the subjects.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Our goal is to determine whether these data provide strong enough evidence for us to generalize the observed relationship in the sample and conclude (with some acceptable and agreed-upon level of uncertainty) that a relationship between X and Y exists in the entire population.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"The primary inference form that we will use in this module, then, is hypothesis testing."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Conceptually, across all the inferential methods that we will learn, we'll test some form of: (We will also discuss point and interval estimation, but our discussion about these forms of inference will be framed around the test.)"
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Recall that in the module about examining the relationship between two variables in the Exploratory Data Analysis unit, our discussion was framed around the role-type classification table."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,This part of the course will be structured exactly in the same way.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In other words, we will go through 3 sections corresponding to cases C→Q, C→C, and Q→Q in the table below."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,(Recall that case Q→C is not discussed in this course.)
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In total, we will introduce 5 inferential methods: three in case C→Q (corresponding to a division of this case into 3 sub-cases) and one in each of the cases C→C and Q→Q."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Unlike the previous part of the course on Inference for One Variable, where we discussed in some detail the theory behind the machinery of the test (such as the null distribution of the test statistic, under which the p-values are calculated), in the 5 inferential procedures that we will introduce in Inference for Relationships, we will discuss much less of that kind of detail."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"The principles are the same, but the details behind the null distribution of the test statistic (under which the p-value is calculated) become more complicated and require knowledge of theoretical results that are definitely beyond the scope of this course."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Instead, within each of the five inferential methods we will focus on: When the inferential method is appropriate for use."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Under what conditions the procedure can safely be used.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,The conceptual idea behind the test (as it is usually captured by the test statistic).
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,How to use software to carry out the procedure in order to get the p-value of the test.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Interpreting the results in the context of the problem.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Also, we will continue to introduce each test according to the four-step process of hypothesis testing."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships," Comparing Two Means—Matched Pairs (Paired t-Test) Overview We are still in Case C→Q of inference about relationships, where the explanatory variable is categorical and the response variable is quantitative."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"As we mentioned in the introduction, we introduce three inferential procedures in this case."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,So far we have introduced the first procedure—the two-sample t-test that is used when we are comparing two means and the samples are independent.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"We now move on to the second procedure, where we also compare two means, but the samples are paired or matched."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,Every observation in one sample is linked with an observation in the other sample.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In this case, the samples are dependent.paired by subject."""
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In other words, each subject is measured twice on the response variable, typically before and then after some kind of treatment/intervention in order to assess its effectiveness.SAT Prep Class Suppose you want to assess the effectiveness of an SAT prep class."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,It would make sense to use the matched pairs design and record each sampled student's SAT score before and after the SAT prep classes are attended: Recall that the two populations represent the two values of the explanatory variable.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In this situation, those two values come from a single set of subjects."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"In other words, both populations really have the same students."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"However, each population has a different value of the explanatory variable."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Those values are: no prep class, prep class."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"This, however, is not the only case where the paired design is used."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Other cases are when the pairs are ""natural pairs,"" such as siblings, twins, or couples."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,We will present two examples in this part.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"The first one will be of the type where each subject is measured twice, and the second one will be a study involving twins."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,This section on matched pairs design will be organized very much like the previous section on two independent samples.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"We will first introduce our leading example, and then present the paired t-test illustrating each step using our example."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"We will then look at another example, and finally talk about estimation using a confidence interval."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"As usual, you'll be able to check your understanding along the way, and will learn how to use software to carry out this test."

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"An answer of 1 means personality has maximum importance and looks no importance at all, whereas an answer of 25 means looks have maximum importance and personality no importance at all."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,The purpose of this survey was to examine whether males and females differ with respect to the importance of looks vs. personality.
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"R was used to calculate the two independent samples t-test result, using gender (Gender) as the categorical explanatory/independent variable and the importance of personality (looks) as the quantitative response/dependent variable."

_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Since this value ends in e-06, the decimal point needs to be moved 6 places to the left."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"Thus, 6.143e-06 equals .000006143, which is very, very small."
_u5_inference,_m2_inference_for_relationships,"When rounded to four decimal points, the P-value is .0001; thus, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the mean score of Females and the mean score of Males on the importance of looks."

_u5_inference,_m3_regression,Welcome to the module on regression analysis.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,We're happy that you chose to study this important statistical topic using this module and hope that your learning experience will be an enriching and enjoyable one.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,The purpose of this introduction is to prepare you conceptually and technically for this module.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"In particular, the goals of this introduction are to give you a general idea of what regression analysis is, describe the structure of the entire module, and help you assess whether you are “ready” for this module in the sense of having the needed background knowledge in statistics."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,Let's begin.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,Am I ready for this module?
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Even though Regression Analysis is listed as the last goal, it might be a good idea to start by letting you know what statistical knowledge this module assumes, so that you can assess whether you are ready for it."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"In general, we assume that students had some introductory statistics course prior to going through this module."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"More specifically, this module assumes knowledge in: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) Graphical displays of data (such as histogram, boxplot and scatterplot)."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Numerical summaries of center and spread (such as the average, median, standard deviation, IQR, and the correlation coefficient r)."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,The distinction between the explanatory (independent) variable and the response (dependent) variable.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,Association vs. causation.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,Sampling distributions The distinction between a parameter and a statistic.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,The idea of the sampling distribution of a statistic.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,The Central Limit Theorem.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Statistical inference Point estimation Interval estimation (confidence intervals) Hypothesis testing (logic, formulation, P-value, drawing conclusions)."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"If you were exposed to these topics, but feel that you might be “rusty” on them, it might be a good idea to refresh your memory before learning this module using the previous materials in the OLI introductory statistics course, or any introductory statistics text."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Another option is start going through this module, see whether the explanations that are provided are enough for you, and if not, go back and refresh your memory."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,What is Regression Analysis?
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Generally speaking, regression analysis is a collection of data analysis methods used for exploring the relationship between variables."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"More specifically, regression analysis methods can be used for assessing whether there is an “important” (or “real”) relationship between variables, and if there is, the methods allow us to summarize this relationship, quantify it, assess its strength, and most importantly use all this information in practice."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"The following two examples illustrate the type of data analysis situations where regression analysis will be helpful, and the type of questions that it will help us answer."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,A statistics professor was interested in exploring the relationship between students’ SAT Math Score (SAT-M) and their “Introductory Statistics” final score.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"In particular, the professor wanted to study whether a student’s SAT-M score is a good predictor for how well he/she will perform in an introductory statistics course in college, and based his analysis on a random sample of 100 college students from his college.In this example we’re exploring the relationship between two variables: The explanatory variable (X) – SAT-M The response variable (Y) – Introductory Statistics final score The professor plots the data using a scatterplot, and observed a clear positive pattern in the relationship between the two variables which also happens to be linear."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,In this module we’ll learn how regression analysis helps us answer questions like the following: Does the data allow us to generalize the observed relationship beyond this specific sample to the entire population of the students in the college?
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,How can we quantify the relationship?
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"For example, If student A scored 100 points more than Student B on the SAT-M, how much better can I expect student A’s performance in the statistics course to be?"
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"How can I use a student’s SAT-M score to predict his/her performance in a statistics course and how accurate, or trustworthy, is this prediction?"
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"In other words, if I predict a student’s score in a statistics course based on his/her SAT-M score, what can I expect my prediction error to be?"
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Or… Just for the sake of discussion, let’s assume the following: The analysis of the data revealed that SAT-M is not a bad predictor, but also not a very accurate one."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"More specifically, the professor found that when SAT-M is used as a predictor for a student’s performance in “Intro Stats”, 95% of the time the prediction will be off by no more than 10 points."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"In other words, in most cases, there will be up to a 10 point difference between the “Intro Stats” score predicted by the SAT-M score of the student and the student’s actual “Intro Stats” score."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Even though Regression Analysis is listed as the last goal, it might be a good idea to start by letting you know what statistical knowledge this module assumes, so that you can assess whether you are ready for it."

_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"How can I use a student’s SAT-M score to predict his/her performance in a statistics course and how accurate, or trustworthy, is this prediction?"
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"In other words, if I predict a student’s score in a statistics course based on his/her SAT-M score, what can I expect my prediction error to be?"
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Or… Just for the sake of discussion, let’s assume the following: The analysis of the data revealed that SAT-M is not a bad predictor, but also not a very accurate one."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"More specifically, the professor found that when SAT-M is used as a predictor for a student’s performance in “Intro Stats”, 95% of the time the prediction will be off by no more than 10 points."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"In other words, in most cases, there will be up to a 10 point difference between the “Intro Stats” score predicted by the SAT-M score of the student and the student’s actual “Intro Stats” score."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression, Let's now take a look at ways our professor can increase the accuracy of his prediction of class scores.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"In order to improve his prediction of students’ performance in “Intro Stats”, the professor decides to use more information about the student (rather than just the students SAT-M score)."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"In other words, instead of using SAT-M as a single explanatory variable, the professor decides to use several explanatory variables which collectively will help predict the student’s performance in “Intro Stats”."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"More specifically, the professor uses the following set explanatory variables: SAT-M – Student’s score on the math portion of the SAT 1)SAT-V – Student’s score on the verbal portion of the SAT 2)HS-GPA – Student’s GPA in the senior year in high-school 3)HS-Algebra – Student’s high-school algebra score 4)Gender – Student’s gender (male or female) 5)HS-Type – Student’s high-school type (private or public)."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"6)and the same response variable Here are some interesting questions that we’ll consider: How can we use all these variables collectively to predict the student’s performance in “Intro Stats”, and is that prediction really much more accurate then when we used SAT-M as the only predictor?Do we really need all these variables?"
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"There are actually two important aspects to this question: The similarities and the differences between these two examples, highlight some of the features and structure of this module."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Note that in both examples the response variable, Y, is a quantitative variable – “Intro Stats” final score."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,In this module we will only explore relationships between variables where the response variable is quantitative.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"[It should be mentioned that the collection of methods exploring relationships between variables where the response variable is categorical is called “Logistic Regression Analysis”, and is beyond the scope of this course."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Note that in the first example we explored the relationship between a single explanatory variable (X) and the response (Y), while in example 2, we explored the relationship between several explanatory variables (X and the (same) response (Y)."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,This difference between the examples captures the structure of this module.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"The module is divided into two sections: 1, X2, …,X6) Simple regression: Exploring the relationship between two variables X – explanatory variable Y – response variable Multiple regression: Exploring the relationship between more than two variables: X 1, X2, …,Xk -- several explanatory variables Y – response variable."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"While, as mentioned in 1 above, we will only consider cases where the response variable is quantitative, note that in example 2 some of the explanatory variables are quantitative (SAT-M, SAT-V, HS-GPA, HS-Algebra), and some of the explanatory variables are categorical (Gender, HS-Type)."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"As we explained in the introduction, multiple regression extends simple regression in that we have more than one explanatory variable."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,We will use the letter k as a notation for the number of explanatory variables we’re considering.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Our goal is to examine the relationship between the explanatory variables X1, X2, X3,….Xk and the response Y, and the following figure gives and outline of the process: Note that since we have k explanatory variables, the dataset that we’re working with is much more complex than in simple regression where for each of then subjects we had two observations; one X observation and one Y observation."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Here, for each of the n subjects we have k+1 observations; one for each of the k explanatory variables, and one for the response.As you remember from simple regression, and as the pink box emphasizes, the inference part of the analysis will be centered around a statistical model for the relationship between the explanatory variables and will be based on the observed data from out sample.Here is how we’ll proceed from here First, we’ll be introduced to the example that will carry us through this section."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,We’ll then discuss the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) part of the analysis.

_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Before we move on the multiple regression analysis, where we’ll analyze all the variables collectively, it would be useful to conduct simple regression analyses of the response versus each of the explanatory variables separately."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"As you’ll see the results of these analyses will be very helpful in understanding what “really going on” when we conduct the multiple regression analysis.Let’s go back to our example, where we’re examining how students’ GPA (Y) is related to their IQ level (X and their 1)“self concept” (X."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"As explained above, what we’ll do is conduct two simple regression analyses:2) GPA (Y) vs. IQ level (X, and 1)GPA (Y) vs. “self concept” (X.2)Here are the results of the first simple regression: Regression Analysis: GPA versus IQ The regression equation is GPA = - 2.87 + 0.0975** IQ Predictor Coef SE Coef T P Constant -2.871 1.061 -2.71 0.009 0.097500 0.009583 10.17 S = 1.03207 R-Sq = 60.0%*** R-Sq(adj) = 59.4% * When IQ is the only explanatory variable in the model (i.e., when Self Concept and all other possible predictors are ignored), it has a significant linear relationship with (effect on) on GPA: ** For every 1 unit increase in IQ, GPA increases, on average, by .0975."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,*** This linear effect accounts for 60% of the variability in GPA.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,Here are the results of the second simple regression analysis: Regression Analysis: GPA versus SC The regression equation is GPA = 3.51 + 0.0749 SC Predictor Coef SE Coef T P Constant -3.5139 0.8038 -4.37 0.000 SC 0.07494 0.01361 5.51 0.000 S = 1.36032 R-Sq = 30.5% R-Sq(adj) = 29.5% Let’s interpret the results together.
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"_u5_m3_mt2 To summarize, we found that both variables, when considered as a single explanatory variable, have a significant linear relationship with the response."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"This result is consistent with our exploratory data analysis (EDA), where we observed that linear relationship."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Furthermore, we found that IQ is a “stronger” than SC as a predictor for GPA by as evident by the R-square values (60% for IQ, vs, 30.5% for SC)."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Again, this is consistent with our EDA when we found that the correlation coefficient between IQ and GPA (.775) is higher than that between GPA and SC (.552)."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"Consider the following three scenarios where relationships between variables are explored: At the end of the semester, an instructor analyzed the data in her grade-book."
_u5_inference,_m3_regression,"In particular, the instructor explored how a student’s final score is related to (or can be predicted using) the student’s two midterm scores, the students HW average, and whether or not the student did the extra credit assignment."

_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"Recall again the Big Picture, the four-step process that encompasses statistics: data production, exploratory data analysis, probability, and inference."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"We are about to start the fourth part of the process and the final section of this course, where we draw on principles learned in the other units (exploratory data analysis, producing data, and probability) in order to accomplish what has been our ultimate goal all along: use a sample to infer (or draw conclusions) about the population from which it was drawn."

_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"We are about to start the fourth part of the process and the final section of this course, where we draw on principles learned in the other units (exploratory data analysis, producing data, and probability) in order to accomplish what has been our ultimate goal all along: use a sample to infer (or draw conclusions) about the population from which it was drawn."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"The specific form of inference called for depends on the type of variables involved—either a single categorical or quantitative variable, or a combination of two variables whose relationship is of interest."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,The purpose of this introduction is to review how we got here and how the previous units fit together to allow us to make reliable inferences.
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"Also, we will introduce the various forms of statistical inference that will be discussed in this section, and give a general outline of how this section is organized."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"In the Exploratory Data Analysis unit, we learned to display and summarize data that were obtained from a sample."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"Regardless of whether we had one variable and we examined its distribution, or whether we had two variables and we examined the relationship between them, it was always understood that these summaries applied only to the data at hand; we did not attempt to make claims about the larger population from which the data were obtained.Such generalizations were, however, a long-term goal from the very beginning of the course."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"For this reason, in the Producing Data unit, we took care to establish principles of sampling and study design that would be essential in order for us to claim that, to some extent, what is true for the sample should be also true for the larger population from which the sample originated."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"These principles should be kept in mind throughout this section on statistical inference, since the results that we will obtain will not hold if there was bias in the sampling process, or flaws in the study design under which variables' values were measured."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,Perhaps the most important principle stressed in the Producing Data unit was that of randomization.
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"Randomization is essential not only because it prevents bias but also because it permits us to rely on the laws of probability, which is the scientific study of random behavior."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"In the Probability unit, we established basic laws for the behavior of random variables."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"We ultimately focused on two random variables of particular relevance: the sample mean ( ) and the sample proportion ( X ¯ ), and the last module of the Probability unit was devoted to exploring their sampling distributions."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"We learned what probability theory tells us to expect from the values of the sample mean and the sample proportion, given that the corresponding population parameters—the population mean (μ) and the population proportion (p)—are known."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"p ˆ As we mentioned in that module, the value of such results is more theoretical than practical, since in real-life situations we seldom know what is true for the entire population."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"All we know is what we see in the sample, and we want to use this information to say something concrete about the larger population."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"Probability theory has set the stage to accomplish this: learning what to expect from the value of sample mean, given that population mean takes a certain value, teaches us (as we'll soon learn) what to expect from the value of the unknown population mean, given that a particular value of sample mean has been observed."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"Similarly, since we have established how sample proportion behaves relative to population proportion, we will now be able to turn this around and say something about the value of population proportion, based on an observed sample proportion."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,This summary provides a quick recap of the big ideas you've learned in the inference section (without going into any of the technical details).
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"Therefore, this summary does not provide complete coverage of the material and thus should be used only as a checklist or a quick review of the ""big ideas"" before an exam."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"In the Inference unit, which is the last step in the ""Big Picture,"" we use the evidence provided by the data to infer about the relevant population."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"The inference could be about the value of unknown parameters in our population (mean, proportion, difference between means, etc.)"
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,or about the existence of a certain relationship between two variables in the population.
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,Point Estimation Idea: estimating an unknown parameter with a single value (that was obtained from the observed data).We typically estimate: Note that the last two parameters (σ and the population mean μ by the sample mean x ¯ the population proportion p by the sample proportion p ˆ the population standard deviation σ and the population variance by the sample standard deviation σ 2 s and the sample variance s 2 ) are not covered in this course.
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"σ 2 , x ¯ , s, and p ˆ are unbiased estimators for μ, p, σ, and s 2 , respectively."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,Their precision increases with the sample size.
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,σ 2 Interval Estimation Idea: Estimating an unknown parameter with an interval of plausible values and attaching to the interval our level of confidence that it indeed covers the true value of the parameter.
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,Such an interval is therefore called a confidence interval.
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"where the margin of error represents the maximum estimation error for a given level of confidence, and is the product of the confidence multiplier and the standard deviation (or standard error) of the point estimator."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"point estimate ± margin of error For the confidence interval for the population mean, μ, we distinguished between: σ is known (in which case we use the z* confidence multipliers), and σ is unknown and is replaced by the sample standard deviation S (in which case we use the t* confidence multipliers, and rely on software to do the calculations)."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,and n ⋅ p ˆ ≥ 10 .
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"n ⋅ 1 − p ˆ ≥ 10 Hypothesis Testing Idea: Unlike point and interval estimation, in which the goal is estimating an unknown parameter, in hypothesis testing we are assessing the evidence provided by the data in favor or against some claim about the population.o, which is challenged by Ha, and we are assessing whether or not the data provide evidence (beyond a reasonable doubt) that we can reject Ho in favor of Ha."
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"If they do, we say that the results are significant; otherwise, if Ho cannot be rejected, we say that the results are not significant.H o and Ha are two claims about the population."

_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"Note that 0.05 represents our ""reasonable doubt."""
_u5_inference,x-oli-workbook_page,"The p-value can be viewed as a measure of the evidence in the data against Ho, where the smaller the p-value, the larger the evidence against Ho.o."
