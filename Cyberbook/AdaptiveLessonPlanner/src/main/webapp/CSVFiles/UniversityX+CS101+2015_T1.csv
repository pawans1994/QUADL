Multiplication can also be visualized as counting objects arranged in a rectangle (for whole numbers) or as finding the area of a rectangle whose sides have given lengths. The area of a rectangle does not depend on which side is measured first, which illustrates the commutative property. The product of two measurements is a new type of measurement, for instance multiplying the lengths of the two sides of a rectangle gives its area, this is the subject of dimensional analysis.  The inverse operation of multiplication is division. <br/><br/>For example, since 4 multiplied by 3 equals 12, then 12 divided by 3 equals 4.

It is anticommutative, meaning that changing the order changes the sign of the answer.
