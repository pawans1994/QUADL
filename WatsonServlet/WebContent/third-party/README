DO NOT MODIFY FILES IN THIS TREE!!!

These are from GitHub (and potentially other external sites).  Though it is
possible to modify files here, committing/pushing them will try to commit to
the third party site.

To add/delete/modify these links, change the svn property svn:externals on this
directory.

Note: many of these are links to specific tagged versions in the repository
so that we can make sure to use stable versions.  Again, modify svn:externals
if you would like to change versions.
